 Manchester City if they can win at Anfield for the first time since 2003 they would be 10 points ahead of Liverpool. We're just about set for kickoff. Liverpool with Alison in goal, Alexander Arnold Fabinho, Henderson and Robertson, Jones, Thiago, Wijnaldum, Salah, Firmino and Manet, Manchester City with Edison, Cancelo, Stones, Diascens and Zincenco, the tightest defence in the Premier League this season. Rodry, Vanado Silva, Gundawan, Mares, Sterling and Foden. The referee is Michael Oliva. It's the first time Michael Oliva has refereed Liverpool since the Merseyside Derby in the autumn when Virgil van Dijk was injured when he was clattered by Jordan Pickford. Michael Oliva puts his whistle to his lips and the players take the knee which has great significance at the moment with all of the bad things that have been going on on social media. So up they get and Manchester City get us underway here at Anfield, BBC Radio Five Live, the World Service are with us as well. There will be people listening and watching this match all around the globe. It is Liverpool against Manchester City and the ball is back with Edison who clears the ball out towards the left hand side, City with the ball deep inside their own half. The first big thing, Phil Foden is playing as that number nine. Sterling on the left hand side, Mares on the right, we all thought that Foden was on the left hand side, Sterling in the centre forward, but Foden is occupying that centre forward position but will drop deep to a number ten space and that will mean that Mares and Sterling's pace will run behind. So that's how City have started it, that's how Pep Guardiola has begun but of course that's subject to change. Bernardo Silva now Manchester City enjoying possession of the ball in the early stages and Rodri just turning it back into central defence. You look at Cantel's position now, stones and Diaz just isolated with Rodri, Cantel is playing as a central right-sided midfield player when City have the ball so it's very similar to... Oh, Edison has passed the ball straight to Sario Mane who's 30 yards out but City are quickly back into position and Liverpool couldn't take advantage, most of like Edison it was a brilliant pass straight to Mane. I'll tell you what, it's Mane's poor touch wasn't it John? It's almost, you know, come off his shim pad and went back towards his on-go if he took it forward with his pace would be a good opportunity for Liverpool. That's Robbie Savage with us on five live in the World Service, Welsh international Premier League midfielder and Liverpool conceding a free kick to Jagal has dived in there, centre field this is just next to the centre circle and is it Gundewan who is caught? The player has stayed down, I think it is Ilkai Gundewan who turned away from Sauer and then Tiago comes in and just catches the back of his heel. Yeah, you'll say that Tiago's nowhere near the ball. I think that should have been a yellow card John, doesn't matter what minute of the game is that should have been a yellow card. I think it is a yellow, yeah it is a yellow, he's got the card out now Michael Ollibach so a booking in the first, in the third minute of the match for Tiago for that foul on Ilkai Gundewan who's still down and as Robbie and Pat Nevin were saying before the match you know I think it's one of the great things about City at the moment and the reason that they're on this run of 13 wins in a row is the fact that so many of their players are in good form, they're in prime form so there's no De Bruyne, no Kevin De Bruyne, no Sergio Aguero at the moment, the others have stepped up and Gundewan is one of them and if he's not able to continue that would be a big loss but here he is getting to his feet now, I think he's going to be okay. Yeah, you know for Pep and Manchester City he's been so influential, you know Kevin De Bruyne for me the best midfield player in the world, you know not in this Manchester City side Gundewan has stepped up, he's been you know fantastic and you know in Germany I'm led to believe that they think he's the best German player this million time. Nine goals this season from Ilkai Gundewan but it's his all-round play really as much as the goals. Liverpool nil, Manchester City nil and we do have a choice for you at the moment, the six nations match, the Wales Ireland match is on five live sports extra, Wales 11, Ireland 13 was the last score that I had, it's now Wales 18, Ireland 13 and you can listen to that five live sports extra on your digital radio or on BBC sounds or via BBC sounds. Here's Mane playing the ball into the penalty area, Firmino tries to angle it back to Thiago, Gundewan who's okay, Gundewan steps in and it's played up through the middle to Raheem Sterling, Gabriel Gézous only on the substitutes bench for this match, Jordan Henderson and Firmino in central defence for Liverpool and the ball has played out to Trent Alexander-Arnold who very much enjoyed listening to Steve Crossman's interview with him. In the build-up to this match that we were playing you earlier, it's on the football daily podcast today, it's well worth a listen, Firmino right for the ball downfield, Salah brings it down but Zincchenko is tight into him and plays it off, Liverpool's leading scorer for a three in Manchester City. What was the score on the rugby John? 18-13 to Wales just to make it absolutely clear. Do you know what John, you look at Salah and Márez, I think they're the two best players in the game, you know when it's that diagonal, that switcher play, the way they bring the ball down on the half folly instantly, those two are remarkable at doing it so it's going to be interesting to see how those two in the game this afternoon because two brilliant players. This Manchester City team who as they say have really hit their straps at the moment with this club record win, run of consecutive wins but also the fact that they've not conceded a goal in their last six Premier League matches, 21 clean sheets, 21 in all competitions this season, 21 clean sheets out of 33 matches and in one of them they conceded five goals against Leicester but that was before Dias came along who unquestionably has made a big difference. He has Alisson at the back, he's back from illness passing the ball to Jones and Bernardo Silva trying to close down Alisson who has to hurry his clearance which he does and as a result he hits it straight out of play on the far side, 10 yards inside the Liverpool half. Manchester City attacking towards the Cop in the first half setting up high here in the main stand with Robbie Savage socially distanced of course to my right, here's Márez on the right hand side and now Cancelot plays it in, it's a chest height oh and it bounced through Foden and then bounced off Gunduan and runs through for a goal kick. They're just two teams just looking you know the way they both have lined up, surprised me that Foden is the setter forward, both teams trying to play out, City pressing really high John. They are with Liverpool in possession in their own defence of third and Alexander-Arnold hits a long pass to Firmino down the right and then the challenge comes in and him just a knock it out of play for a throwing which is taken quickly Tiago now in his orange boots, pushing goes full 360 degrees and then goes back into central defence, Henderson looks up, he's going for a long pass over the top for Mane but he's got City defenders either side of him both Cancelot and Stones and it bounces all the way through to Edison who's got the ball quite comfortably. It's a cold afternoon as you won't be surprised to hear there's been the occasional flurry of light snow but heavy grey clouds above Anfield, the lights are on, it's Nilnil and it's Manchester City the Premier League leaders who have the ball in the middle of their own half. John is fascinating so City there had a go kick they play out, they go to a 3-2-4-1 formation, the two players are Cancelot and Rodry and the centre half, the two is in Chenco's on the left hand side, Stones on the right with Diaz in the centre so it's amazing how they find a way to get out of the way they play, look at Cancel's position out, chance. Rodry finds Sterling on the left hand side, Sterling up against Alexander-Arnold lays it back, Zinchenko with a shot, it's cleared away by Henderson, he had to clear that, Forden was behind him if he hadn't, Forden would have been in on the edge of the six yard box that Henderson was able to get it away then Salah is crowded out by Sky Blue shirts and Manchester City are back in possession in the centre circle. It was a good block John as you said because Phil Forden would have had a tapping, good defending. And Manchester City have stuck with Forden through the middle, Márez is right out here on the right hand side and Sterling who was found by Rodry there for that last attack, Sterling in a very wide position on the left hand side, really interesting tussle, they drew 1-1 at the end, he had stadium in the autumn, terrific first half if you remember that match, Kevin De Bruyne missing the penalty as well and then it rather fizzled out in the second half after promising so much, Diaz's ball over the top but that's an easy one for Alisson holding Black to come to the edge of his area and catch. The reason why Sterling and Márez stay so wide John is because that allows the space for Gundewan and Bernardo Silva, so if you're one out then you're on Gundewan, Tiago going Bernardo Silva then who picks Cancelo is that for Meenals, Jop? And just looking at them now Robbie when City have got the ball at the back, I mean it's very clear isn't it, Sterling right over on the left, Márez right over here on the right hand side and clearly you know that's countering the danger of Liverpool's full backs as well isn't it? It's fascinating Liverpool then pressing high, it's fascinating technically to watch this game John. Throw in to Manchester City, level with the edge of their own penalty area, Liverpool 0, Manchester City 0, Forden takes the ball down, puts it back to Rodry who works it out with the far side but Alexander-Arnold's going to get there ahead of Sterling, Sterling puts the challenge in and then a heavy touch from Alexander-Arnold meant that Rodry was able to come across and take possession back from Manchester City, excellent work from Gundewan, now Bernardo Silva works himself out of a tight little situation there, he's another of the players who've run into form this season, Bernardo Silva gets the ball himself and then wins a three on the halfway line. So nil nil it is, Wales in front against Ireland, three o'clock kickoff in the six nations, earlier in the premiership, finished Newcastle 9, Exeter 15 in the rugby union premiership and if you've just switched on you haven't heard the earlier football results, Tottenham won two nil against West Brom, Harry Kane came back, scored, so did Son, so Tottenham two West Brom nil, finished Wolves nil, Leicester nil in our first commentary match and it finished Hamilton one, Rangers one, bottom of the table Hamilton scoring a very late equaliser against Rangers, six o' six later to talk about it all, we've got Comensure on Schafeel United, Chelsea as well on Five Live before Robbie and Chris on six o' six with the full name, Liverpool with the ball on the right hand side and here's Alexander Arnold, 30 yards out, Wijnaldum and Alexander Arnold plays it in towards Femina who's ball forward, took a deflection that bounced away, four Manchester City and then Canslow is able to clear it towards the halfway line, Henderson got there first on, now Robertson, Robertson with a cross from the left, Deass is underneath that and is able to volley it high across the penalty area, Femino nodded it back in, then Tiago's underneath it, then Alexander Arnold heads it forward, it's head tennis between the two sides and then eventually the ball is down with Sterling, it might have been took back there but Sterling does well, plays the ball up towards the edge of the box but referee Oliver has brought it back for Fowl on the halfway line, let's get another update from Gareth Lewis watching Wales Ireland in the six nations. So 21-13, Wales leads 67 when it's gone and that lead half-bunny penalty has taken Wales crucially more than a converted try clear, Wales looking to improve on last year when they only beat Georgia and Italy twice, they've not got long to go now to give Wijn Peeback there and a pressure head coach, a much needed win and victory to kick off this six nations campaign, 21 points to 13 they lead Ireland. Thank you Gareth, so Gareth with a common treat with James Hook and Tommy Ball on sports extra, did you catch the score there Robbie? 21-13 it is to Wales, just in case you missed it, three to City, level with the edge of the Liverpool box, which has taken short for Sterling, who plays it back to Roderick, square from him, cancel in that position, Robbie's been talking about forward of the centre circle and Gunderwain, just a little touch there from Jones, took it away from Gunderwain and said you have to start again on the halfway line. Interesting start that's come up on social media and since Tiago returned to Liverpool starting that from January the fourth, he's made 20 fouls, no other players made more. Ball has been won back on the halfway line by Jones, Jones turned it in field but it was behind Firmino so that's slow deliverable momentum, here's Tiago who Robbie was talking about there, committing that early foul on Gunderwain and receiving the yellow card, so a long time for him to play in the engine room with a yellow card. Was that ooo because of the stats on because they were Liverpool were breaking? Both, both, yes an early yellow card and have to cope with that in midfield, that must bring back a few memories Robbie, Jones, mind you you were, you know you were a master weren't you, getting the early yellow card and then not, not getting the red, here's Tiago, playing it out to the left hand side, taken down by Robertson, Robertson with a high ball into the six yard box, a stretch by Edison but a comfortable catch. Yeah good possession from Liverpool there just keeping the ball Tiago, getting on it trying to dictate the plate. Edison's just going to roll it back to Diaz, now he was reading Jimmy Carriga's newspaper column yesterday he was putting Diaz forward as a lead and contender for the player of the year this season, he has Joe, at Stones playing it forward, in the sides Tiago on Bernardo Silva, he just pulled the ball away from him, he was sliding in there, I think Bernardo Silva done well he's just seen Tiago come and just used his body, well but he did dive in Tiago didn't he on a yellow card, that's that surprised me actually you know what you wouldn't associate Tiago, you know making so many fouls because he's so beautiful when he gets the ball, but if he if he just slightly missed time back that would have been Liverpool down to 10 men in the first quarter of an hour, however Diaz Márez playing it into the penalty area headed away by Fabinho, bounces out in the day, Wijnaldum hooks it over the head of Bernardo Silva and then he's shoved off the ball as he tries to reach it ahead of Rodri, so it's a free kick to Liverpool halfway inside the wrong half. That was brilliant from Wijnaldum wasn't it John, the skill and then the ability to move away from a challenge and then got fouled just relieving you know the pressure on Liverpool. It was lovely play by Wijnaldum, flicked it over the head of Bernardo Silva, Liverpool nil, Manchester City nil, City winning the ball back from Tiago, cancelo it was and now Bernardo Silva running in field, it's taken on by Márez but Jones does well for Liverpool, now 20 years old, a teenager no longer Curtis Jones, Robertson on the left for Liverpool plays forward, that's intercepted by Rodri, he does really well against Firmino, just held off the challenge, played it in field where Diaz works it out with the left hand side to Izinchenko and now Sterling in field from him to Fulton, she just switched on, Phil Fulton is playing as the false nine, Gabriel Gézous only on the bench today despite the fact he scored two goals in his last two appearances, Gabriel Gézous including one of the goals in midweek in what was City's 13th win in a row, Izinchenko playing the ball over the top but it's headed down by Alexander Arnold and now Salah nice change of feet from him up towards Firmino but that's strong, strong and very good defensive work in the centre field and now Márez is off and running, skips round one challenge, skips round another, plays it back, Gundawan works it towards the left hand side, Sterling with a little bit of space there, Alexander Arnold is onto him, Sterling's into the box, excellent, excellent tackle from Alexander Arnold, whipped the ball away from Raheem Sterling as clean as a whistle and now Salah has the ball 10 yards inside Manchester City Territory beginning to warm up here at Anfield. Brilliant defending from Trent Alexander-Arnold, John was it one of one, Sterling into the box, had to make the challenge, it was a fantastic challenge but then you look at City you know in transition Diaz has run forward, Rodry just sat in as a centre half next to Stones and that nullified the counter-attack of Liverpool. Yeah and Sterling was at pace there as well, great defending, yeah running at Alexander Arnold, he had to get that right but he did so it is 0-0 Liverpool 0 Manchester City 0 and while Manchester City have been going win after win after win Liverpool have won only three of their last 10 matches in all competitions, not scored in their last three games here at Anfield. They never lost three home games in the run in the Premier League either John, this could be a first today. It could and it is currently 0-0, Stones chipping the ball away towards Foden who under pressure headed it back, Cancelo is in there in front of the penalty area, now Bernardo Silva Liverpool pressing Manchester City but Manchester City playing out a bit or are they? Foden's caught in possession, wanted a free kick, no free kick, Manny and Thiago but then Bernardo Silva to the rescue for Manchester City he's got the ball back and he plays it back into his own penalty area. Hasn't got going John yet has it? Not quite yet, it's very tight and as Robbie Savage has been saying certainly capically it is it's very interesting, hardly any space out there at all and Manchester City with the ball in front of their own penalty area playing it out towards the left hand side where Diaz receives it back from Rodgerie Diaz in danger of losing it and indeed under pressure very nearly gave it away however City still have it, Gunduan then gives it to Bernardo Silva now he has Mares down the right hand side three City players inside the box, Mares is challenged well by Robertson, Cancelo Bernardo Silva back to Mares now in the full back position, Curling left footed across headed away by Fabinho comes out, oh Salas lost it, Banstoff, Imzenchenko is all over it, Sterling now, Sterling tries to thread it across the box but it's blocked by Curtis Jones inside his own penalty area and Liverpool are able to to get it away to the halfway line but Mane trying, Mane was all on his own on the halfway line only succeeded in losing possession and now City bring it forward again, Imzenchenko City with Sterling, Gunduan again, Gunduan turning Liverpool three men around him so City are very happy to go back into this centre circle here and switch the direction of play to the right hand side still goalless here at Anfield almost 20 minutes played, Bernardo Silva, this cold wind that's blowing around the ground just ruffling the shirts of the City players and then Dias gets it all wrong with a pass from just Fordham left of the centre circle that he over hits massively way out of play landed in the on the canvases in the lower tier of the Serkene d'Alvistam and as soon as he hit it he immediately looked over his shoulder down to the pitch at Anfield that must have been that massive divot, I don't know what happened there, 20 up passes though, I was going to say the pitches must have been like that when I played Liverpool nil Manchester City nil Fabinho heads it away on the edge of the box and the ball eventually bounces out for a throwing to Liverpool in their own right back area Fabinho missed the last three matches Fabinho there's Wijnaldum now and then Alexander-Arnold gets right behind that but skies it actually so City played forward Gundawang low lovely touch Fordham back to Gundawang important interception back in there from Curtis Jones City looking very dangerous around the Liverpool penalty area Wijnaldum breaks away with the ball shrugs off the challenge Liverpool there dangerous front three are all available Salah on the right hand side receives it from Wijnaldum Alexander-Arnold back to Salah Curtis Jones to London ever so well done he was a one to track the run great defensive midfield play then Wijnaldum showing you know good strength to shrug off and fill Fordham but how many final third entries have we had from either side John and no attempts on target it's not been that many is there no not made a note yet has there been a shot on target no City I think carrying the greatest threat at the moment Wijnaldum in center field seems almost unthinkable that he would not be a Liverpool player next season but it seems very likely that'll be the case Wijnaldum out of contract at the end of the season Liverpool nil Manchester let's get back to Wales Ireland and Gareth Lewis but Wales still leading by 21 points to 16 now a penalty from Billy Burns for Ireland has made it a nervous final seven minutes or so here in Cardiff when P back the Wales coach chasing a rare win against one of the big boys Ireland looking for on a first away win under their head coach Andy Farrell it's nervous stuff Ireland down to 14 from the 13th minute of the game after Peter Omani was set off as a stand-off well to just enough 21 16 they lead you can hear the the final minutes of the match with Gareth and James Hook and Tommy Ball over on five live sports extra right now here on five live the Premier League the big match Liverpool nil Manchester City nil enthralling stuff but without any end product so we're halfway through the first half and it's still no no I heard Thomas Tuchel John talking about a final third recoveries you know pressing out the park and City have done that quite well final third recovery has to go forward Gundogan couldn't find the pass out to the left hand side as in Czenko who puts his palms apart over there on the far side wondering why that that ball couldn't be delivered by Gundogan and then Wijnaldum is fouled a little foul from behind by Bernardo Silva who hairs back into position center field pre-kicked a Liverpool half inside their own half so it is nil nil I think the temperature is dipping the winds are going to increase I've been glued to the weather forecast over the course of the last week snow is you've been glued to the weather for really because I was I was worried about this weekend with the snow big forecast anyway we're okay at the moment here's Fabinho it's like Ian Dennis who puts the wind up with me it must be an interesting house of ludes to the weather forecast it's Ian Ian's in contact with me all the time he's out of the snow forecast tomorrow just be careful you'll be all right you haven't got far to go home here's Henderson long ball from the back and then Czenko gets his head to it it's kept in play on the far side by Alexander Arnold Alexander Arnold against Czenko beats him to the line then plays it in and Mane just outside the six-yard box just stabbed his header a yard over the top first big chance of the game I think Maneu did I'll be disappointed he hasn't at the target there it's great play from Trent Alexander Arnold on that right hand side you know it's a diagonal ball he keeps the ball in ever so well so great desire then beats the fall back and then just drives it towards you know the penalty spot in between the penalty spot on the six-yard line central and Maneu gets the run on the defender and can sell up I think he's got to do better there John first big chance he could have allowed it to bounce out of play Alexander Arnold but he was decisive seized the initiative and it nearly worked for Liverpool and now Maneu is in an offside position just while you're talking there Robbie as well did you see Gundewan had a little nibble back at Thiago a little foul on the halfway line took his opportunity just to get one back after Thiago's earlier foul on Gundewan you know 61% possession from Man City but the first big chance of the game for Liverpool John yeah Maneu with the the header over the top ball is back with Allyson who even though he's got folding just three four yards away from him just steps back and then chips the ball out and finds Robertson down the left-hand side Robertson's ball into the right back position Stones plays it across to the the Brazilian goalkeeper at the other end Edison all in green long high left footed clearance Stirling got a shove in the back from Alexander Arnold there but it's given only as a throw in which Alexander Arnold takes probably ten yards away from where the ball actually went out of play usually the officials are red hot on that sort of thing wasn't closer to the opponent's goal however here's Henderson and front of his own penalty area plays it across to Fabinho it's Henderson and Phillips the other evening against Brighton when Brighton played so well here defended brilliantly ball at the back with the shaven headed Brazilian Fabinho then up to Thiago and now Wine Aldam Wine Aldam looking for Robertson down the left hand side Robertson with space in front of him but he goes in field towards Sadio Mane Firmino comes short uses Wine Aldam though and then Thiago Liverpool with possession inside the Manchester City half they've not had a great deal of that so far and it's been given away by Thiago and folding now folding passes the ball into the path of Márez Sadio Mane came back in with a challenge just did enough to nudge over Márez and it's a free kick to Manchester City for the right-hand side here 30 yards out yeah Mane doing his defensive work there running back but it was one of those where you know like the David Louise sending off where he's just trying to stop his run and his knee clips Márez obviously you know 40 yards out wide therefore it's going to be a free kick to Manchester City Jürgen Klopp down there very warmly wrapped up he's got his long padded coat he's got a black wee hat on gloves and he's watching Manchester City placing this free kick a one-man wall a salar shaped Liverpool wall Gundawang is going to take this Liverpool holding their line on the edge of the box Gundawang ships it in over everyone and it bounces away out of play for a throwing near the corner flag yeah they try to look for Rodry so Liverpool holding the 18 yard line the ball wide on this right hand side Rodry made a run from deep to get round the back but the pass was overhead so it's a throwing to Liverpool over there on the far side too far away from the cop with all of the various Liverpool supporters Banner's direct over the seats there's Sadio Mane inside his own half a little foul kicks the free kick the ball might have been moving there as well and indeed it was because Michael Oliver says no I can't let you away with that it's got to come back by the letter of the law we've got a lot of letter of the law going on haven't we this season here's Henderson Henderson to Fabinho surely John that's Succek Redcat will be overturned surely they have appealed against it I think what largely went unsaid about that was the fact that Mitrovich didn't cover himself in glory there by any means might be part of the simulation game tonight well I would I would like to think so Robbie with you and Chris from well I presume it would be just after nine o'clock tonight after the the Sheffield United Chelsea commentary you're getting used to your late Sunday nights aren't you here's Mane that challenge well by Cancelot Mane went down suggesting it was a free kick referee Oliver Lau plays to continue Henderson's ball over the top but that was well watched by Diaz comes out for me no with a shot and Edison had to be sharp there little steps to his left pushed it over the top of the crossbar it was bang on target from Firmino Jordan Henderson brilliant there the ball up to Fordon he was on the front foot he got there in front of Fordon the only look for the run it was a ball over the top Salah just couldn't quite get him he was a good defensive header and then Firmino going towards the touch line spins hits it on the volley and Edison at that near post palms it over great technique from Firmino corner four Liverpool first corner of the match it is nil nil the score here it is into the edge of the six yard box Diaz was there to head it away all Fordon has done well Fordon takes it on he's beaten Alexander Arnold and then the final covering challenge from Liverpool's from Curtis Jones and he was the last man but he timed his run brilliantly and took the ball away from Phil Fordon who if he'd been unable to do that it would have been a clear run through for Fordon. Talking about the two youngsters before the game weren't we and that was a great example of desire from you know two fantastic players Phil Fordon great skill then Curtis Jones the energy and the desire to run back if he wasn't there big problems for for Liverpool. Yep Jones the the Liverpoolian the Liverpool fan against the Stockport lad Phil Fordon the Manchester City fan and Liverpool and Jones came out on top there how quick was Jones then very quick had to be as well nil nil Liverpool have created the two clearest chances so far despite the early promise from Manchester City manne with his header over Firmino with the volley that was comfortably saved in the end by Edison the helicopter with its light on this heading our way as Alexander Arnold crosses from the right hand side that's headed up Edison comes and catches the ball in front of his throat high above Sadio Manne and the danger has gone. Then you can see that Liverpool now coming into the game you know the possession stats are 51-49 now just in City's favour so they are getting more possession you know they're getting the ball out wide they're starting to create one or two good situations in City's final third. And I think what's encouraging or what will encourage Jurgen Klopp and Liverpool supporters is that Alexander Arnold is coming into the game there already put a couple of very good balls in from the right hand side you know that's been something that's been missing really for Liverpool that that delivery from the right and the left from Alexander Arnold and Robertson by their high standards here is Robertson now crossing that's a good ball in but Zincenko is able to come across Firmino couldn't get a meaningful touch on it the bounces down in the City right back area Firmino back through Robertson and Jones towards the halfway line that helicopter continues to to buzz around way over the top of the Sarkany Dalglish stand. Liverpool now Manchester City now near in the the final whistle in the Wales Ireland game Wales just in front Alexander Arnold curling the ball across and then across comes John Stones to get his head to it and Zincenko can't keep it in on the dead ball line it's a corner to Liverpool. It's a good job Stones did come across and headed John because he was into a great area the ball landing central on the six yard line Edison come out he's nowhere near it I tell you Hedneson's playing well John from that centre half position playing very very well. Another corner from the far side the right and again it's Robertson who's going to take this rather than Alexander Arnold so it's the in-swinger from the far side and Robertson raises his right arm here it is the delivery into the six yard box but it comes up ahead of Rodgery and he glances it into the opposite full back position and it bounces out for a throwing to Liverpool. Henderson is going to leave this for Robertson to take Robertson making his way across from the far side Henderson drops it and bounces up really enjoyed listening to Trent Alexander Arnold talking about Jordan Henderson and his influence and his presence around the club the captain and Fabinho in the centre circle Fabinho playing it through towards Firmino but it's clear to win Liverpool with Alexander Arnold finds Salah on the far side Salah further infield towards Wijnaldum and now Firmino and now Salah Jones takes it up as well in the middle of the Manchester City half this is more like Liverpool more like the champions Thiago to the left hand side Robertson Robertson back to Thiago Thiago plays it across to Salah who tees up Jones who plays it through into the box but Stirling excellent recovery from Stirling sensing the danger and he was in there to get to the ball before it could reach Alexander Arnold but here's Robertson now on the left hand side Liverpool are cranking up the pressure here Thiago turns gives it back towards Henderson closer towards the halfway line Jones Jones turns between Foden and Stirling and gives it out to Alexander Arnold who looks for Jones Jones is there and will go back into the centre circle having the best spell now Robbie he wants to get on the ball all the time doesn't he Curtis Jones in that midfield area yeah confidence stuff just wants to get in between the lines on the half turn to look to go forward all the time plays in the half space ever so well still no nail on five live with just over 10 minutes to go to half time will have more on Wales Ireland in a moment or two that can that can only be seconds left in the Six Nations match the three o'clock kickoff still Wales 21 Ireland 16 here in Liverpool with Wine Alden giving it out to Robertson on the left hand side now back to Jones looks up uses Sadio Manet who turns Rodry comes across and then because of that Manet gives it straight to Gunda Wang and then Foden is fouled in the centre circle and it's a free kick to Manchester City and we've seen the momentum swing from City who had the better of it earlier on to Liverpool who've had the better spell over the course of the last 15 minutes yeah they haven't been a threat have they at all Man City you know no shots to trouble Alison yet you know maybe might be a just five minutes to go before half time just put forward not left hand side put Stern as a set the forward they've been very rigid you know forward and you usually see City when they change positions they've all really stuck to their positions here's Gunda Wang on the left hand side finds Sterling Sterling up against Alexander Arnold again Sterling goes past him now up against Fabinho oh he goes down it's a penalty Fabinho came in with a challenge Sterling was sent tumbling and referee Michael Oliver who was well positioned there pointed straight to the penalty spot Tiago asks the question Henderson comes across but these are these are not it's not an angry Liverpool they are asking the question but the penalties being given Sterling I think what's happened is as Sterling does ever so well drives past Alexander Arnold drives drives into the box and then it's Fabinho's training leg as he jumps he sticks his you know a leg out and catches Sterling I think it's a definite penalty so it's a penalty to Manchester City so City have now been awarded penalties in four of the last six league meetings they've missed two of the last three against Liverpool remember Marez here a couple of years ago remember De Bruyne missing at the Eddie Had earlier this season well this time it's Gunda Wang who's missed only one penalty in his career Gunda Wang right footed against Allison oh he's put it over the top he's missed the top left corner and the ball lands in the cop and it stays Liverpool 0 Manchester City 0 and remarkably City have now missed three of their last four penalties against Liverpool wow short run up wasn't it went for power pulls it over the bar like wow what a miss that is what is with City in penalties against Liverpool John I'm amazed by that and that missed by quite a distance there's probably a yard over the top that is a massive let-off for Liverpool it's still 0-0 and what an opportunity missed by Manchester City and by Gunda Wang the final whistle has gone in Cardiff it has finished it has finished Wales 21 Ireland 16 more at halftime but here's Robertson Robertson's ball in towards Salah who chests it down but the chest down took it away from him and Manchester City are able to clear through stones actually plays it off Manning and it bounces behind for a goal kick and the body language of the Manchester City players you can it's written all over them frustration that they had the chance there to take the lead seven minutes to go to halftime and they weren't able to take it it was great play wasn't it from Raheem Sterling no there was one moment early in the halftime when he run at Trent Alexander-Arnold it was great tackle wasn't it on this occasion he went past Alexander-Arnold and Fabino stuck his leg out was a penalty then Gunda Wang short run up smashes it pulls it over the bar full of confidence and Silke Gunda Wang he's never scored as many goals in any season in his career as he has this season that would have taken him to double figures as I say only missed one penalty in his career before that was against Tottenham last season if you remember but has scored from the spot this season but there he went for the top left corner as he looked at it and it was probably at least a couple possibly a yard over the top and the ball landed halfway up the cop Liverpool 0 Manchester City 0 just over five minutes to go to halftime now Jones plays it in field and then back to Fabinho who conceded the penalty Raheem Sterling winning it with his trickery the he's had a couple of runs like that Sterling the former Liverpool man remember into the Liverpool penalty area as Liverpool win it back from Bernardo Silva for Mino up towards Salah Salah tried to work it through to Manet but it was cut out on the edge of the box by Diaz and Cancelo just well in a very tight position there against Thiago and still drags the ball back plays it past Thiago now Bernardo Silva back to Cancelo again and then Cancelo plays it central leader Gundawan who heads it back to the edge of his own penalty area you've got to say John Sterling so dangerous isn't he when he gets on the run and drives into the box I think no players got more penalty since 2018 the Premier League and Raheem Sterling because of his so dynamic and so positive in those areas yeah that's the danger you know that's what you get you can play Sterling as the central man but out there on the left hand side there is that added threat Manet passing the ball beyond Alexander Arnold who does well to keep it in on that far side Alexander Arnold then back to Salah Salah low ball to Manet edge of the box back to Salah shoots takes a double deflection they're appealing for handball referee Oliver says no Jones to Robertson Robertson on the left hand side plays it across and a stretch and a clearance by Diaz. I tell you what John I tell this could be an ball. It's a close proximity which makes me think it might not be but the arm is outstretched I've only seen it here we've got a replay on our screen now as no that's no it's not a penalty what am I talking about I'm not even sure he was Rodgery it's him on the arm I think he might have been just outside the box as well actually so definitely wouldn't certainly wouldn't but they've had a look you know they always will and it remains nil nil Liverpool nil Manchester City nil. You've got to say all the Liverpool players appealed John didn't they in close proximity they did but Michael Oliver was quite decisive about that Salah playing the ball over the top headed away by Cancelo answers down for Manchester City and then it's played forward by Rodgery he has Foden turning playing it into Thiago it bounces favourably for City Gundawan now Zinchenko to Sterling who's got his heels on the white line over there on the far side comes back in field Cancelo in that central position very nearly lost out to Mani but was able to recover and it finds Márez on the right hand side remember Márez hitting the ball over the crossbar here at Anfield a couple of years ago right at the end of the game I'm not sure who missed it by most Márez or Gundawan today here's Foden Foden driving forward centrally but showed too much of the ball to Fabinho he was able to just clear it away from him Robertson passes the ball across his penalty area to Allyson and Allyson lifts it forward to Jones just well actually to keep that in Jones however Manchester City were all over him and win the ball back Gundawan playing it forward it's cleared away now he has Fomino through the middle Fomino lifts it via an angle to Mani who might have been caught right on the edge of the box by Cancelo referee Oliver says yes he was just waited to see if an advantage was going to develop there for Sario Mani but this was a couple of feet outside the penalty area and it's a free ball oh do you know what we've just lost the line to Anfield so you can hear the crowd in the background but no John Murray or Robbie Savage so we'll try and bring you that back we're obviously very very close to halftime anyway 8 5 0 5 8 at 5 live sport the way to get in touch just while we're waiting to get the commentary team back and Liverpool have a free kick we can rejoin them now I'm delighted to save for the free kick referee just talking to the players in the Manchester City wall and one of the city players is going to lie down behind the wall can't see who it is so we've got we've seen City do this before haven't we Robbie it's a wall of five and Zincenco has has lain down rather like do you remember that shot of William Reese Moe lying down in the house of Cummins on the on the front bench free kick then Tiago hits it via the top of the wall and then up and over the crossbar and behind for a goal kick judging judging by your expression you don't remember that well so you you know you watch the House of Cummins you watch weather reports wow just just curious Robbie that's all corner from the left hand side fall of a pool Alexander Arnold to take this one raises his left arm swings it into the edge of the six yard box headed down goalwards from Mane but it's straight at Edison who is able to move swiftly to his left and just grab the ball into his mid-riff and now Sterling plays it up through the middle Manchester City quick quickly off on the counter attack Foden comes across and then the ball bounces out of play on the far side two minutes of added time have been added on and it's a throwing to to Liverpool half inside their own heart do you know what John looking at you know looks like it's going to be nearly a half time and these things since Ruthen Diaz signed for Manchester City in September they've only conceived seven goals in the Premier League it is quite remarkable isn't it it is an astonishing change of fortune isn't it that that they've been able to do that and and stones and Diaz together they've started this is the 14th match they've started together and in those matches City have conceded one goal ball over the top four city gundoan on the chase but the ball bounced up high off the surface here and gundoan took it down and he was shepherded away by Alexander Arnold he has Sterling now on the left hand side Sterling back to Roderick calls the ball across the box but it's straight into the path of Jones in Liverpool look to break away here in added time at the end of the first half Manchester City having missed the penalty through gundoan so it's still now now five live in the world service Manet plays the ball to Salah on the right hand side Jones makes himself available so the good first half Curtis Jones Jones then with City players either side of him he loses it to Sterling and Manchester City clear towards the halfway line Allison the Liverpool goalkeeper relieved man when he saw the gundoan penalty fly over the top corner Liverpool play forward towards Robertson cancelo comes across and then was able to turn the ball under pressure out of play Liverpool take the throw quickly here's Tiago Tiago in the field towards Firmino he's dropped deep here Firmino finds Fabinho in the centre circle Wine Aldermas available as well so is Tiago and then Robertson takes the ball on the outside of his left boot flicks it into his own path Sadio Mane is going nowhere because that's the half-time whistle so the big talking point in the first half the fact that Manchester City missed a penalty in the 37th minute penalty won by Sterling challenged by Fabinho gundoan stepped up and he hit it over the top corner into the cop but other than that it's been tight Robby Savage Liverpool with the the header from Mane that was over the top Firmino's volley that was comfortably saved by Edison and Manchester City other than the penalty really creating very little very little indeed you know Liverpool now more possession in the game 54% they grew into the game and having their best spell without really creating chances and then Sterling's great run positivity getting to the box it was a penalty and then the big motin the game gundoan putting the ball in the in the cop so no no yeah half-time here at Anfield no goals Liverpool 0 Manchester City 0 well John the the old Jacob Rees mug reclining incident almost broke social media the penalty missed today has gone pretty close so many people getting in touch with it let's read a few of them Liz I just don't know how a German international can take a penalty like that we can't be doing that of all people not even on target London money says after that penalty England could do a lot worse than get gundoan in for the next six nations yes very good we have heard Daniel City terrible at penalties this is Guardiola's refusal to let Edison take them coward there have been loads Robbie on social media of people saying that pet said in the past he's the best penalty taker well the interesting start um Steve City have scored nine of the 17 penalties in the Premier League so it's quite remarkable really to think that you know it's a four-star 52.4% conversion rate that was very very quick yeah yeah didn't work rather that was good at schools huh well clearly maths especially very good at MPE believe it or not um so yeah um yeah Edison yeah it's a good point you know one day yeah one day hopefully one day you were also as John alluded to very early in the game good at avoiding the second yellow card now I'm not saying the game today took a bit of time to get going but I did spend 20 minutes doing some research on your career all right Robbie so you got 145 yellow cards in your career did I you did only once did you get a second yellow and I watched the video it was never a second yellow it was a disgraceful decision I'm Chris Foy so so the question is based on Tiago being in the engine room sitting on a yellow card how do you do it when you're in a position of that importance how do you avoid the second yellow and still have a big impact on the game you know it's very difficult you know um I was going to say in a big game but I never played that many um you look at Jeff Hendrick yesterday Steve don't you he'd been booked early and then he pulled the shirt that for me is stupidity you know I was never in a position where you'd give a a silly second yellow and that was silly isn't if you if you're in the in the last five minutes you defendly you're throwing yourself in blocks and challenges then okay you might get one but what I tend to do is that mentality of do you know what don't do anything stupid you know like the pull of the shirt or things like that I never changed the way I played um Steve I always went in for challenges and I got away with a lot to be fair I should have had more but I just think I was clever and clever and Robbie Savage don't usually go together as John's alluded to several times since I've been working with him no no don't do yourself down be clever I think that's a good message for for Tiago in the second half didn't look very clever Ilkai Gundawan's penalty did it way over the bar and that is why at halftime at Anfield it's Liverpool nil Manchester City nil we'll look ahead to the Super Bowl we'll get more reaction to today's other games in the Premier League after the news on Five Live with Alison Hughes listen on BBC sounds this is BBC Radio 5 Live the

else Five Lives Premier League Sunday with Steve Crossman halftime at Anfield Liverpool nil Manchester City nil second half commentary to come earlier it finished Wolves nil Leicester nil that means Tottenham Hotspur the only team in the Premier League to score so far today they beat West Brom 2 nil at home to end a run of three defeats in the league goals from Son and Harry Kane on his return from injury as I mentioned Leicester missed the chance to close the gap at the top of the table after they drew at Wolves here's Brendon Rogers point was probably a fair result for both teams but I was I was really pleased we are defending you know our organization a mentality and like I say it's you know they're off a back of a really good result in midweek so to keep the clean sheet was was was nice and like I say we take our point you know what we got in a few times in the first half second half I looked like the goal was common with some really really good moments of play but sometimes you need that little bit of luck as well to fall for you and we didn't quite get that. Now Kastros Michael proved his worse once again that was a well it wasn't an understanding save but it was just the way he stopped Fabio Silva from taking that opportunity. Yeah yeah it's a great skill he has he's so agile he's speed to to get out and then like you say to spread himself I think it's something that's synonymous and the Smercil family they make themselves big and and that was a great save for Kastros and he's always does it there's always a game where he produces for us and that's why he's one of the top goalkeepers at this level. How important is to have Jamie Bardi back you had him on for 30 minutes at the end there? Yeah we just see the threat the minute he's on the pitch how you can stretch the game and gives that energy to the team so yeah and I'll great to have him in the in the game and back available now. That's Brendan Rodgers it is Super Bowl Sunday Tampa Bay Buccaneers Kansas City Chiefs in the biggest game arguably in all sport the most watched certainly will bring you commentary from 11 p.m. tonight here on Five Live big part of our team is former NFL player Jason Bell afternoon Jason. Afternoon and what a night we have I'm so excited for the Super Bowl I'm telling you I'm anxious like I have to play the game the intensity is real coming from me. This is not your first rodeo so anybody listening to this who's like right I am staying up for the Super Bowl what do you have to do to make sure you get through? Well first of all it has to be an entertaining game and we're going to have that because we have the legend Tom Brady against the new legend Patrick Mahomes they're going to be dueling it out and then if you're listening to us we will keep you engaged entertain educated and you got to have a beverage to keep yourself going and some snacks that is the key to a Super Bowl. You know I guess because because the quarterbacks of the story without wishing to jinx it if you know the two QBs are going to be the people everyone is talking about that lends itself to an exciting high scoring game doesn't it? Yeah without a doubt and both these offenses can score points in a hurry. Patrick Mahomes and Kansas City have been the best offense all year and we know what Tom Brady can do with any team and he is loaded with this Buccaneers roster so at any moment they can come on he is the comeback kid so you're just ready for points everywhere to be scored. Does this kind of feel like a bit of a changing of the guard between Brady and Mahomes? Yeah without a doubt that's why this game is so important for Mahomes because if he has any ability to catch up to Tom Brady he's going to have to beat him in a head-on-head matchup they have he has to beat him if he wants to catch him and be the greatest of all time. 18 years between the two of them is there anything is there anything that Mahomes is kind of the the sort of pretender to the throne is there anything he can do that Brady can't at this stage in his career? Oh movement the way Patrick Mahomes moves he can throw the ball any direction off of any platform and Brady can't do that Brady has to be in the pocket protected his footwork has to be the same very repetitive that's the way he plays that's the way he's always played but Patrick Mahomes is just so creative and athletic when he throws the ball he's something we've never seen. Right I've got to make notes here Jason because I will obviously be staying up to listen you mentioned snacks what shall I be getting in? I mean whatever you it's all up to you that's the beauty of the Super Bowl whatever you're into it's okay it's all accepted. All right and what will you be eating then? Oh I'm doing the broadcast man it's water it's protein bars it's everything I'm an athlete I got to keep it together man nothing too crazy. I am not so crisps and beer I think. I like that. Jason thanks very much and enjoy the show. Appreciate it. I can't wait 11 p.m. tonight it's going to be brilliant the Super Bowl live on five live and with Mahomes and Brady and that story it's all set up for a bit of a Hollywood ending I'm sure and in fact speaking of Hollywood Golden Globes nominations were earlier this week there was that huge controversy this is totally away from football I may destroy you by Michaela Cole which is brilliant didn't get a nomination Emily in Paris did get a nomination one of the writers on that show Deborah Coe-Pacon said that she was devastated by that even though her own program has been recognized the reason I'm mentioning this is because she is fascinating she's had a great career she was a war photographer in Afghanistan she is going to be on five live tomorrow on Nihal's show with Jeff Lloyd from 1 p.m. Deborah Coe-Pacon that is definitely something to put in your diary. I think even the best scripted drama would be challenged though by the story we've had at the Principality Stadium today. Wales coming from behind to beat Ireland 21-16 Ireland's Peter Omani was sent off after just 14 minutes despite that they ended up leading the game only to be pegged back George North and Louis Rhys Zammitt scoring tries for Wales ending a run of four straight six nations defeats let's hear from their captain Alan Wynne Jones with Sonja McLaughlin. It was a bit of a pressure on Wales wasn't there how important is it to have started this championship with with the W? I think if you're fortunate enough to pull this on there's always pressure I know what you're saying there's particular pressure obviously after the autumn we had but when I went shy away from that I think the game today probably told the story what happens when you come under a pressure but the positive pressure of having been a man to the good if you like but you know we came through thankfully. You did Ireland went a man down and then they hit you with 13 unanswered points was patience the message? Yeah very much so I think you know that can sometimes galvanise a team and credit to Ireland you know we knew what they were we're going to bring and like I said that probably galvanised them in the middle part of the game. Yeah tries a little bit hard to come by for Wales in the autumn how pleasing to say George North and Louis Samet go over. Yeah I think obviously George was the opportune one I think and we're happy with the constructive Zamos one we'd like to think we probably could finish more off with our possession that we have but we've got a foot in the door at the start of the competition. That's Alan Wynne Jones we're going to go back to Anfield then second half commentary to come of Liverpool Manchester City nil nil thanks to that penalty miss from Ilkai Gunduan just reading some more of the messages you've been sending in Mick Márez de Bruyne now Gunduan three wretched penalties against Liverpool this is such a bizarre curse Sam Quex been on social media good job there are no fans in the cop that penalty could have hurt someone our own Phil McNulty says if City get another then they should let Edison take it he's not the only one saying that your commentary team John Murray and Robbie Savage. Robbie in Gunduan we're talking about a guy who scored a penalty at 22 in a Champions League final against Manuel Neuer so if you're in a team with a guy like that and he misses a penalty can that have quite a big psychological impact on you? No I don't think so I think you know his performance after has been good getting on the ball not hired he's missed a penalty listen the best players in the world miss penalties just one of those things I think he's missed a few now isn't he? No that's the second one he's missed yeah he's only missed one before yeah he's missed two yeah so they won't affect him at all I don't think Steve but listen thanks for your stats I didn't know that you know that's 145 yeah I thought it was 89 the Premier I didn't know the total was 145 wow good stat Steve that's all right thanks for that I told you I'm here for you and also here for you a Robbie Savage and John Murray with a second half at Hanfield thank you Steve the city players are out they're not making any changes Liverpool's players just emerging from the wide tunnel down below with the Liverpool slogans written all in white on the red background and they also will be unchanged at the start of the second half so Liverpool with Alison and Gull a back four of Alexander Arnold Fabinho Henderson and Robertson in midfield Jones Tiago Wine-Aldon and then the front line of Salah Firmino and Manet and the Manchester City side Edison in Gull Cancelo Stones Diaz and Zinchenko in midfield Rodry with Bernardo Silva and Gundawan and then Márez on the right sterling on the left and Phil Forden playing as the the false nine in this match but City even though there's been plenty of intent have created relatively little well and you say that John that was City's the penalty was the only shot they had inside Liverpool's 18 yard box in the whole half Liverpool didn't create much more at the other end Manet with his header over and Firmino's volley that was saved and it is Liverpool with the ball at the back that is fired up to Firmino in the halfway line but City sky blue shirts white shorts sky blue socks against Liverpool and their first choice kit they all read with the white trim Manet playing it into the penalty area Salah with a make making a run across the box but Zinchenko went with him very well and cleared it right for it both teams have defended ever so well John haven't they yeah there's one mistake that's led to the penalty from Firmino but other than that both defences are coming out on top well that's the the secret to Manchester City's success this season all of these clean sheets had six in a roll in the Premier League and City with the main men now in central defence Stones and Diaz together quite a partnership that they've put together in Maricola Port who was missed so much last season very much second string at the moment he's on the bench from Manchester City as is Gabriel Jezus I suspect we will see Gabriel Jezus at some stage in the second half Tiago playing it out to the left hand side and Curtis Jones is out there Jones plays it back to Wine Alden Wine Alden is Liverpool attacked towards the cop in the second half Tiago tried to slip it through on the edge of the box but hit it straight the cancel fireworks being set off from behind the cop actually right behind the cop these yellow green red fireworks are exploding it seems right over the roof of the cop to our right it's become a bit of a thing hasn't it there's Liverpool have the ball inside their own half he has Fabinho it's not unlike when Liverpool lifted the Premier League trophy last year with all of the fireworks going off on the roof of the stadium still they go off it's quite a display this Jones to Mane who just steps away from Bernardo Silva then gives it out to Alexander-Arnold early cross from Alexander-Arnold that's been a bit of a feature actually when he's had the opportunity the early ball in the box but cancel always underneath that for Manchester City and now it's Sterling as Manchester City break deep inside Liverpool territory Sterling it was he won the penalty in the first half challenged by Fabinho but it remains 0-0 BBC Five Live Five Lives Premier League Sunday and the BBC World Service live from Anfield on this cold February afternoon we've still got commentary to come from South Yorkshire Sheffield United Chelsea from 715 the city our court offside Raheem Sterling and that's a free kick to Liverpool and after that it'll be Robbie Savage and Chris Sutton with the late Sunday night 6 0 6 phone in you can get in touch on 8 5 0 5 8 anytime you like there's not much at all about from this game so far John is it other than you know City not getting beat here you would suggest that the massive favour is to win the Premier League once again. Foden slips as he plays the ball out towards Sterling but it bounced back to him now Sterling is around Alexander-Arnold plays it across Foden with a chance saved by Arson but it's converted in the six yard box by Gungawan and Manchester City have the lead he missed a penalty in the first half but he was there in the six yard box in the second it's Gungawan it's Manchester City they lead at Anfield 1-0. To answer Steve's question at halftime how will it affect the players in the side how will it affect Gungawan by smashing that penalty into the court there's the answer great reaction from Man City's wonderful play once again from Raheem Sterling the way glided past players and then Foden the little 1-2 but I've got to say Trent Alexander-Arnold one-on-one there poor poor play and then Foden a shot low down to Allisons left it's a good save but then Gungawan was quick to react Roberson couldn't get there four yards out smashes it into the net brilliant from Man City but I've got to say John the one-on-one situation there from Trent we're sterling defensively poor from Trent Alexander-Arnold Sterling just dance past him so easily and Foden very nearly scored himself that was a really sharp save by Allisons down to his left from from only a few yards away from Foden but he could only push it out into the six yard box and Gungawan was there to score his 10th goal of the season for Manchester City in all competitions and Manchester City are exactly where Pep Guardiola wants them to be here at Anfield Guardiola who's never won as a manager at Anfield but seeing his team winning 1-0 now at a ground where Manchester City have not won since 2003 and with this scoreline Liverpool 0 Manchester City 1 if it stays like this City's grip on this title race will be extremely tight. It'll be over John no one's going to catch Manchester City no they just don't concede goals you know they they they can win games by playing beautiful football they can win games the hard way just a fantastic football inside ah when Liverpool have all their players fit to John as well they are and they're a match for Man City you know the champions but you know because of their injuries because of key players out in people argue Kevin de Bruyne and Aguero. They'd be right to do that he has Foden on the left hand side swings in because Sterling in the middle couldn't get there and it very nearly reached Márez but Liverpool would just able to clear it through Robertson so close to Sterling who would have been all on his own in the middle eight yards out and that could easily have been 2-0 Jürgen Klopp stands hands behind his back Pep Guardiola just sits calmly on his red anfield seat in the dugout satisfied with what's happened now no matter now that penalty miss at the end of the first half from Ilkai Kundoan because he was there to slide in and score and give Manchester City the lead and now Liverpool the onus is on them and remember Liverpool have failed to score in their last three matches here at Anfield they've got to break that sequence if they're going to get anything out of this against the current Premier League leaders and that will be a Premier League their record you know three defeats in a row at home in the Premier League it's not happened before will it be a first here this afternoon John I mean it's it's such a dramatic change of fortunes for Liverpool as City played up towards Foden on the halfway line Sterling wants it over here but Foden goes short to Cancelor and then back into his own half yeah until this run Liverpool were almost unbeatable here was a 68 game 68 home Premier League matches without defeat they scored in 42 consecutive home league matches and suddenly now the dry spell here's Alexander Arnold on the right hand side Liverpool go back to Thiago centrally Salah, Firmino and Manet now is the time that they have to deliver against Manchester City who've got their sights set on taking the Premier League title off Liverpool City who've won it four times in the last eight seasons. Alison in front of his penalty area Alison turns it out to the the left hand side and it'll be taken forward by Henderson the Liverpool captain finds the left back Robertson Liverpool coming forward attacking towards the cop back to Thiago Thiago serial title winner with Barcelona and Bayern Munich his ball forward onto the head of Zincenco which was not left back by Pep Guardiola today and then Diaz goes back to Edison who swipes it left footed away downfield oh Fabinho missed this header but he was impeded by Foden says referee Oliver and it's a free kick to Liverpool half inside their own half Liverpool nil Manchester City one Robbie Savage yeah I see the time was right there for Edison just to smash it and I thought Fabinho done well there was one on one before and just used his body was a foul from Foden. Home Premier League football later this evening Sheffield United against Chelsea on five live more Premier League football on five live tomorrow night Leeds United against Crystal Palace a team that everyone wants to see this season so you'll hear that live from Ellen Droght and then we've got FA Cup commentaries on Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday here's Fomino Fomino to Jones 25 yards out back onto his left foot goes for goal but sends his shot a couple of yards over the top of Edison's crossbar yeah we haven't seen much at all have we from Salah Mane with that one big chance in the first half of the header for Mino and always volley in the first half and that's been about it created nothing in the second half yet other than that shot over the top by Jones and already 10 minutes played in the second half Gundawan scoring in the 50th minute for Manchester City here's Fabinho at the back that's the goal down plays it to Jones Jones under pressure from Gundawan the pull worker to the left hand side in front of the almost completely empty Saqenidar Gleesh stand say one or two people on the on the gantry that we used to commentate from hanging from the roof of the stand there here's Alexander Arnold on the right hand side his cross is blocked by the shins and Zinchenko and the ball bounces back out towards the right and out for a corner to Liverpool from the right urgency now from Liverpool has to be Liverpool must get something out of this game otherwise there'll be 10 points behind Manchester City tonight the champions Robertson's going to take this Alexander Arnold trots away Robertson he's got a cameraman hovering right next to him Robertson takes it left footed into the six yard box Edison comes but it's actually headed away for City by Rodry center circle Alexander Arnold left footed high ball over the top cancelor allowed it to bounce he was hoping it was going to kick on he's got Liverpool and then either side of him but he works it away just flicks it away and he finds a teammate in sky blue and then Bernardo Silver is bundled over on the far side by Henderson and it's a free kick to Manchester City half inside the infield it's only given us a throw in hi said to you john which player scored the most goals so far in 2021 what was your answer with is that in the Premier League or yeah so it's it must be Gundewang yeah that's how well he's playing John and he's Mr penalty well that is eight goals since mid-december that he scored and 18 13 appearances it is for Elkay Gundewang but it's not it's not just that is it it's his overall play brilliant magnificent and we said it before the game didn't we you know with a time he'll be in advanced or Phil Fordon do you think he's blossomed because there's no David Silver you can think about that because Alexander Arnold plays it off well John's has done well ridden the challenge shoots a cross goal and just wider the foot of the far post fire a little deflection as well I tell you what I thought John Stones and ever so well they just stuck his foot out and I took it past the post but Curtis Jones he's played well for Liverpool this afternoon good play curls in I think it's the touch from Stones which takes it past the post corner then Alexander Arnold with this one the outswinger that's headed up and away near the penalty spot Rodry again he headed away the last corner headed the first one away from Robertson headed the second one away from Alexander Arnold and Liverpool are making no impression with the set pieces such as they've had Liverpool nil Manchester City one if you've just joined us big game in the six nations was won by Wales 21 points to 16 they'll have more on that later you'll be able to read all about it of course on the BBC sport website earlier Tottenham were winners against West Brom Kane and Son both scored so Harry Kane now with 13 Premier League goals this season two behind Mo Salah with 15 Wolves nil Leicester nil was our first Premier League commentary of the day finished Hamilton won Rangers won late equaliser for Hamilton the bottom club against the leaders Rangers you'll be able to talk all about it with Robbie Savage and Chris Sutton just after nine o'clock tonight on 606 ball played in field by Liverpool here's Jones again holding off Rodry just outside the D uses Thiago Thiago stabs it forward Firmino in the D tries to work it back slightly behind Jones but Manchester City they defended so well they know their jobs so well that this is going to be a real challenge for Liverpool to find a way through Paul played by Jones for Mani but it was too far ahead of him Kundoan was back in there the goal scorer and Manchester City played away Sterling Firmino got there first Alexander-Arnold just beat him to it Liverpool have to start again from inside their own half Liverpool trying to build ahead of steam Robbie yeah they are but so compact you know city defending the width of the 18-yard box no space between the lines good shape Mani loses out to Bernardo Silva Henderson in on the challenge then it's played forward by Márez Bernardo Silva Liverpool are stretched here Forden's available in the middle but it goes back towards the centre circle to Kundoan who turns and shapes his body as he passes it to Sterling Sterling's up against Alexander-Arnold again but Mani is back to help him out this time so on this occasion Sterling doesn't go running at Alexander-Arnold in Manchester City with the lead that they have or can tend to go back towards the halfway line ideal scenario this for Manchester City coming here with the lead that they've got the the two-point lead at the top of the table with two matches in hand against Manchester United the seven-point lead that they've currently got over Liverpool to be one meal up is is absolutely they've got Liverpool where they want them now Márez Márez running at Robertson checks back ball bounces away but it bounces back to Manchester City Cancellors there and he will play it back towards the halfway line and suddenly after that spell of Liverpool pressure Manchester City have responded and now Liverpool can't get the ball off the Premier League leaders Zinchenko the fairhead Ukrainian he's listening on breakfast this morning they had a Ukrainian Liverpool fan on who was talking about where he'd be watching this game in Kiev he is Sterling Sterling gets the ball down Kundoan Kundoan now plays it in field into the path of Rodry who works it across came off the head of Jones and then on the edge of the box Roberton is challenged by Bunhardo Silva and then up towards Mane who's just fouled inside his own half and it's a free kick to Liverpool Manchester City leading one nil you know City dominating the game without creating that much you know but you go back to the goal the way Sterling went past Alexander Arnault we seen the penalty as well yes it was Fabinho who brought Sterling down but the way on that occasion Alexander Arnault was great pass from Neely from oh Diaz has given it straight to Salah and then the recovering challenge he's found him it's a penalty to Liverpool now in front of the Cop Diaz the ball bounced off him it's a yellow card for the Manchester City defender he attempted to clear it after Alexander Arnault's long ball forward for Salah he cleared it straight into Salah it bounced back past him and he just bundled him over inside the penalty area as Salah was looking to go through so only a yellow card for Diaz oh tell you what Salah has got the ball he drives into the box Diaz grabs oh grabs his arm listen more Salah has certainly made the most of it he's thrown himself down but there was contact he grabbed his arm it's a penalty VA I've had a look at it Michael Oliver was certain so chance for Liverpool to equalise more Salah who scored all six of his penalties this season in front of the Cop this is where Gundawan missed in the first half Salah sets out to the right left footed high into the net it's a goal it's an equaliser for Liverpool it's one one here between the champions and the Premier League leaders now the same corner Gundawan went for put it over no mistake from Salah wonderful penalty great desire from Salah wasn't it John a mistake from Diaz yes he pulled Salah's arm is was there enough for Salah to go down listen I did the same thing if I was Salah and he puts the penalty away ever so well one one Salah Mohammed Salah scoring his 22nd goal of the season his 16th in the Premier League the Premier League's leading scorer this season but Sterling's off on a run Sterling still going trying to find Mahrez but the pass from Sterling was just a little short and so Robertson was able to move across and clear it away downfield well that's that's a lifeline for Liverpool there wasn't any great prospect was there of Liverpool fighting their way back into the game but that that slip that characteristic slip from Diaz passing the ball clearing it straight into sat he was a little unfortunate was there enough was there enough pressure from Diaz on Salah's arm John for Salah to go down that's the question I'm asking you he grew up he grew well no there wasn't no that's the answer to the question for him to go down in that manner no there wasn't but Diaz grabbed his arm in the penalty area was Salah feature in the simulation game do you think not for the first time Mahrez crossing from the right hand side but Alexander-Arnold was able to get up in between Foden and Gündewan and headed away Pep Guardiola very warmly wrapped up Pep Guardiola was not really seen much of him have we on the edge of the coaching area he's got one of those big scarves of his own very wise he has Mane Mane turns gives the ball out towards the left hand side but Robertson Robertson cross straight into the council all stays in play Robertson plays it back towards the halfway line Liverpool won Manchester City won just as it was at the Etihad when they met in November and there was a miss penalty in that game John wasn't it Kevin De Bruyne it that's correct ball played over the top Canslow is able to to head it away he's backed away what drinks slips as he gives it to Gündewan neither manager flop no Guardiola I was going to say has made a change yet but as I look down there it's Shaqiri who's being prepared to come on for Liverpool that's going to be the first substitution for either team I was wondering who it might be so presumably one of the three or is Jurgen Klopp feeling that he's got to go for this here is Mahrez on the right hand side Mahrez back to it Canslow centrally Canslow works it across to the left hand side Sterling gets it down Alexander-Arnold goes very tight on him and then he gets support from Thiago just puts a foot in and takes it away from him but City are still in possession this is this is very very interesting now how long have we got left 25 minutes to play 1-1 the champions really need to win it if they can City of course want to win it if they get a point that's absolutely fine he has Bernardo Silva Bernardo Silva to the right to cancel it left-footed ball is heading away on the edge of the box by the Liverpool captain Henderson next to his England colleague Foden Salah goes down very easily in the center circle doesn't win a free kick this time from referee Oliver Sterling it's beaten challenged that's a fine Alexander-Arnold Alexander-Arnold down a long pass well that's easily headed by Stones and Rodry is there to to tidy it up so that the goal that Liverpool have scored only the second goal that Manchester City have conceded when Stones and Diaz have started together from Manchester City and that one obviously coming from the penalty spot the change is going to be Thiago yeah the Jurgen Klopp feeling that he's got to go for this taking off one of them it fielded and it's a double change Milner's coming on as well so Thiago is replaced by Shaqiri and James Milner Premier League winner with Manchester City a couple of times he was there he was on the bench on that famous day against Queen's Park Rangers back in 2012 and it's going to be is it Curtis Jones that's coming yeah I'm surprised they don't yeah I think he's playing well Curtis Jones you know Milner's surprised when he came off was it against West Ham when Curtis Jones come on and Klopp and Milner the laugh on the sideline now now he's through the way around can Milner have a big impact on the game like Curtis Jones did when he come on in that game and how are Liverpool going to play this with Shaqiri Manne Fomino and Salah on Shaqiri the start had offers the right-sided midfield city coming forward no Thiago now in the field Sterling to his where gets away from Alexander on crosses across the penalty area Foden went down then the shot from Bernardo Silver on the edge of the D but he sliced it well wide I was just wondering when when Foden was challenged near the penalty spot and went down whether we might have perhaps even seen another penalty there but it's only a goal kick for Liverpool good play from Sterling you know good defending from Roberson it was I think John you got across and put the blocking on on Phil Ford and the ball was perfect wasn't it 20 yards out central Bernardo's Bernardo Silver running on to it smashes it just passed the post Liverpool won Manchester City won five live and the World Service from the BBC and all manner of live sports still to come today on BBC radio he has Manne turning and running at the penalty area then giving the ball to Robertson on the left hand side Robertson back towards Fomino little shuffle from him into the penalty area Manne turns crosses left footed headed away by Zincchenko who got up high in Manchester City clear the ball away on the edge of their own penalty area through Gunduan in fact he's running it away Gunduan angles a low pass out to Foden and Foden tries to go around Fabinho and he's tugged over he's holed over Foden certain yellow card for Fabinho Foden was away from him the yellow card to commit no from Fabinho there for his side because Foden was away down that left hand side they had runners go into the box huge the important foul there from Fabinho and Gabriel Jesus is going to come on for Manchester City's first change with 20 minutes to play so free kick for Manchester City on the left hand side so with Jurgen Klopp committing more men forward Pep Guardiola sees this as the time to bring on his number nine won't happen just yet Fabinho Jesus waiting to come on but Gunduan is going to swing in this free kick from the left hand side the score is one one in fact he takes it short to Foden takes a touch left for the ball lovely ball in and it's scored it's to wonder Manchester City no it's not the goal is ruled out it was Stonze who is in there who converted it on the stretch but the flag is up and the goal does not stand it's one one this is going to be so I've just seen it for the first time I tell you what John I think it's the right ball is so close isn't it wow it's a wonderful ball from Foden Stonze stretches out and volleys it in up the post it is so so tight right decision I think it is yeah credit to to Simon Bennett who is the assistant on the far side there were there were other city players in an offside position the question was whether Stonze was but he was but he was and and city the the change sees Márez leave the field Márez who's had a couple of moments but not much more than that yeah I think now we'll see Gabriel Jesus going to the number nine position four to go up to that right hand side so here comes Gabriel Jesus who never scored at Anfield for Manchester City two goals in his last two appearances though in the wins against Poney and Sheffield United Manchester City making the change and Phil Foden has run out towards the right hand side so Liverpool one Manchester City one we've still got Sheffield United Chelsea to come on five lives this evening from 7 15 John Akerz and Leon Osmond will bring you that and then after that it's 6 0 6 with Robbie and Chris and then after that it's the Super Bowl Vernon K is on five tonight presenting our coverage of the Super Bowl Darren Fletcher with the commentary so that is from round about 11 o'clock it's on BBC television as well stops on BBC two then on BBC one because match of the day is on BBC one from 10 30 with all of the Premier League goals and the highlights from this match are you going to watch it jump the match of the day yes I probably will here's Foden Foden into the penalty area on the right hand side as well still going Foden steps it across and it's in for 2 1 to Manchester City it's going to win again and Manchester City lead for the second time in the match here at Anfield and off they go in a sky blue huddle in one corner of Anfield Liverpool facing defeat again at Anfield against their fierce rivals the Premier League leaders Liverpool one Manchester City two wow it's all come from Alison initially you know had the ball on the edge of his area the ball got stuck under his feet then Fabinho Clears it City win the second ball they keep it going the ball then gets played back to Alison he tries to drive it with his right for out wide straight to fill Foden who does ever so well brilliant desire brilliant play cuts it back there's gun to one very similar position Joe when he got the first goal two yards out into an empty net but Alison what are you doing Phil Ford and magnificent gun to one with two city with two what's Alison doing Alison usually his touches so sure such an important part of of the Jurgen Klopp Liverpool but that was that's a mistake getting the ball away city still had a lot to do Phil Ford and magnificent job brilliant driving run having just taken up the position on the right hand side he drove it past defenders into the penalty area to the byline pulled it back across and Gundoghan was there to score his second goal of the match his second goal in the six yard box and that makes it 11 goals for him this season could have been a hat trick of course if he'd scored his penalty in the first half but that's a that's a forgotten memory now and the way that the city players celebrated together in one corner of Anfield Manchester City who've not won here since 2003 and what a landmark win this would be for for Manchester City in the context of this season the fact that they're doing it at the home of the champions the team Liverpool that finished so far ahead of them last season but this season it's a different story and it's Manchester City who lead by two goals to one and Sterling running Alexander-Arnold cleared it round one side of him very nearly got there Fabinho was able to take it on though. You know John the two Liverpool four backs are brilliant players going forward brilliant but on one-on-one situations there are question marks both goals have been when Sterling drove at Alexander-Arnold got into the box led to a goal went past him easy and that case on the right hand side forwarded driving into the box they couldn't touch him so when you can isolate Liverpool four backs one-on-one they are vulnerable. Yeah but that's not easy to do as as history shows us but Manchester City have been able to do it here today and I think from the outside you know Alison's given it away again and this is trouble for Liverpool the ball is chipped across Sterling's there and heads it in from just a few inches out and it's three one to Manchester City it's their day at Anfield it's Pep Guardiola's day against Jurgen Klopp and the Premier League leaders are winning here now convincingly against the champions on their own ground Sterling with the third Liverpool one Manchester City three and it's another error from Alison that led to this one. I'm in shock what am I watching here we talked about final third recoveries from you know Man City that first half what is he doing Alison he just gives the ball to Bernardo Silva so the ball gets played back to him it's on his right foot he tried it the first time again straight to Bernardo Silva he's driving it and then the audacity to flick it over Alison was magnificent Sterling heads it in from a yard what a Liverpool doing credit man City oh I'm in shock John what is Alison doing John what is he doing twice John he can't believe it but you Liverpool can't believe it you I took for him to make two errors like that I suppose you know it's pressure isn't it it's a pressure situation Liverpool up against it knew that they had to get something out of this game today he's already made one mistake and his reaction was to pick a water bottle out of his goal and spray it over his own head as if he needed to wake himself up as the balls played forward for for Liverpool but they surely must be beyond them now wow Edison comes out and and claims the ball at the other end incredible John you know the first that goal there he had one touch with his right foot played out wide and it was he looked a bit nervous in the second one first time tried to play out wide again straight to Bernardo Silva who was standing on the 18 yard line wide straight to him drove it and then flicked it over him to an unmarked Sterling wow I can't believe what I'm watching well there's only 12 minutes to play Liverpool won Manchester City three two goals from Gundawan one from Sterling remember Gundawan missed a penalty in the first half and Liverpool all they've got to show for it is the the Salah penalty in the second half which which came from a Manchester City era so this is very decisively Manchester City's day those fours was bundled over those between two Liverpool players Manchester City with a free kick and they're in absolutely no hurry here they really have got Liverpool exactly where they want them now Liverpool facing a third consecutive home defeat there'll be 10 points behind Manchester City tonight having played a game more and in the form that Manchester City are in this for them will make it 14 wins in a row but what a win this is and also in what we've done yet John they've not won yet but also in in what in what we felt was such a tight race suddenly in the space of really just a couple of weeks or so Manchester City have gone away from the rest City have won and won and won and the others have fallen away you're looking like now City are going to win the Premier League the relegation battle as well the bottom three look like they're going to be the bottom three it looks like now the most interesting interesting thing going forward the Premier League will be the battle for the Champions League places however as you rightly said Robbie it's still 10 minutes to play in Liverpool behind closed doors here at Anfield maybe it would be different if there was a crowd in here trying to stoke them up but it is despite the artificial crowd that you can hear it is really so quiet inside Anfield and Liverpool have to raise themselves and against this Manchester City defence that is the best by a distance in the Premier League this season this is a massively tall order and here this latest ball forward Robertson can't reach it and it's a goal kick to Manchester City you just can't believe how Liverpool haven't created any chances really John two in the first half Manus header have been for me those chance was a difficult one and then the penalty which Salah put away well but they haven't threatened at all I suppose the biggest surprise today is that Liverpool have scored here at Anfield and that was from the penalty spot well Giaz has given it away Milner on the left hand side Milner couldn't get the crossover Penaura Silva blocked it and it's out of play for a throw to Liverpool near the corner frog on the first side but you've got a sage on this Liverpool side you know they've got lots of injuries players playing out of position you know for them to they'll still be where they are on the table I think you've got to give them credit because any side will suffer the injuries they have but you know all sides this season are facing injuries too important John but you know when you think Henderson playing at set now for being up for being up playing at set now they're too midfield plays taking out that position you're missing you to defenders Jotter you know what a big sign and he was so I think they have suffered massively John to be fair because of the way they've had to move players around City with a ball inside their own half City who've missed important players during the course of this season as well and indeed at the moment the win that's been talked about since since Guardiola and top exchanged words on Friday the win that Manchester City had at Chelsea when you know they were missing five six players that was a that was a superb win in difficult circumstances here is Jesus Gabriel Jesus picks out Foden on the right hand side Foden into the penalty area Foden left the chart oh brilliant goal from Phil Foden that wraps it up for Manchester City here at Anfield oh he hit that so well from the angle it flew above Allyson into the roof of the net superb stuff from City here at Anfield Liverpool won Manchester City four that's the pick of the lot stop it stop it Phil Foden that's ridiculous wow set one goal Pepp moving forward and over to that right hand side it was good play Gabriel Jesus switches to play Foden talking about one-on-one situations comes inside one touch pass Robertson and then absolutely smashes it over Allyson who was kneeling down the power beats Allyson you would say John it's straight at him and Allyson for some reason kneels down the power beats him but that shot was hit at some pace Liverpool coming forward but this game's gone now a ball bounces off Alexander-Arnold through to Edison who actually Alexander-Arnold just had a kick out as Edison was looking to pick it up there Alexander-Arnold was running away Edison's not very happy he's wagging his finger at referee Michael Oliver the motions with his foot that Alexander-Arnold had kicked out at him now he's kicked the ball into the cob as well he's not very happy at all about that challenge but there was a one-on-one situation again wasn't it a one-on-one situation in a wide area Foden driving in and you've got to say Pep Guardiola seen it you said it John in commentary you know he reacted bringing Gabriel Jesus on taking matters off putting Foden to that right hand side Foden set went up and scored the fourth brilliant from Pep brilliant from sitting magnificent from Foden with his tenth of the season and Liverpool's home form here at Anfield well it's just fallen apart for them or rather it's been taken apart by they've been taken apart John second half by Manchester City's play but also by the mistakes that have been made allison to the four and one of the most dependable players that Liverpool have had in Klopschine here and now the final change being made by Jürgen Klopp senior class is coming on to replace Andy Robertson who gets a little hug from Jürgen Klopp but Phil Foden went past Robertson too easily really from a Liverpool point of view. Like Sterling did for Alexander Arnold on the first goal listen the magnificent players that never go fullbacks to where they go for listen the team massively miss Virgil van Dijk it's as simple as that you know the way his leadership quality is the way he makes players better around him you know it's a huge huge miss but they've got to get on with it title over taken apart in the second half by a wonderful man city by a wonderful Phil Foden. Five minutes to play the score line at Anfield Liverpool won Manchester City four what a day for for City who is still going on all fronts despite the you know we talked about the injuries they've got the Cup final like Carabao the Carabao Cup final to come against Tottenham in April top of the Premier League in the last 16 of the Champions League against Bruce Munchen Gladbach which is a tie City will be favourites to come through in the FA Cup they go to Swansea on Wednesday that's one of our commentaries it'll start off on Sports Extra that one five thirty kickoff on Wednesday Liverpool with Alexander-Arnold out of the FA Cup now well off the pace in the Premier League winner throw in winner corner here on the right Alexander-Arnold playing it off Zinchenko he's going to leave it for Shaqiri Shaqiri gives the single signal two arms raised we're in the 87th minute though in Manchester City surely can't be caught here Shaqiri to take this in it goes to the edge of the six yard box stones got his head to it and the ball is deflected out towards the far side John on Fordham's goal you know I've only seen it twice do you think Allyson needed to like go down because it was straight at him did the power beat him if he stands up straight he saves it it was ferociously hit by Fordham and I'll be very interested to hear later I'm sure somebody will put a timer on that and find the speed of it but it was so sweetly and purely struck by Fordham but it did go above the head of the the Liverpool goalkeeper who dropped down as you say Robbie on his name all over the top Edison comes gets a punch on it away from Sario Mani Firmino plays it out towards the far side Simicasa is there but Manchester City bring it away towards the halfway line Alexander-Arnold is able to to get a touch thought to take it back into the Liverpool half and Simicasa will play it back towards us but the way the City have pressed Liverpool John the amount of final third recoveries they've got high up in Liverpool's final third press them make fours in errors listen Allyson you know they are two shocking errors for the two goals but you've got to credit City John for the press Manchester City heading for their first victory here since May 2003 it was the last match of that season it's Kevin Keegan's Manchester City former Liverpool striker who was the manager of City when actually that day City started with Anelka and Fowler up front two former Liverpool players and Anelka scored the late winner but City's record here is absolutely terrible the that's their only win in 33 visits to Anfield when was the last time Liverpool could see the four goals in it in the hole in the Premier League have they in the Premier League well I'm sure they will I'm sure they will but unfortunately my assistant Juliet has disappeared downstairs to do the interviews Zincenko will play it in field maybe somebody back at base can look that one up for us Steve Crossman if you're listening here's Shaqiri back to Milner now it's curled into the box by Salah Milner's after it Zincenko gets there first and clears it away Manchester City four one up at Anfield in Liverpool at what was there former fortress here at Anfield well suddenly that form has completely disappeared the Arsenal score four jump was it that's Andrea Sharpe anything you've done very well to dredge that one up it was when 2009 it was to run about then yes for the 4-4 draw when our Shabin scored I mean they did they did that's in the Premier League they did come see five goals here and against Arsenal in the in the caribou cup last season five-five draw that uh they're certainly in the Premier League that might well be the last time good job one of us in our region yeah you've done well there Robin there are no fries on you so four one Manchester City lead and we're in the 90th minute now how quickly things change but that is that is classic football isn't it Manchester City back in their stride and really after this it's going to be a brave person who says that Manchester City will relinquish the lead that they have even with most of the second half of the season to go crossing the left hand side from Simicast too close to Edison and we're into three minutes of added time at the end of the match so live sports are come for those who are listening on five live we've got Sheffield United Chelsea to come from 7 15 we have the Super Bowl tonight from round about 11 o'clock Tampa Bay against Kansas City the Australian Open tennis starts in the morning and we will have our usual coverage of that but not quite the usual because of the travel restrictions uh the studio UK based coverage but we'll still have tennis breakfast on five live sports extra in the morning from seven o'clock the test match as well in the cricket social is on the website and the BBC sport app and of course at breakfast time tomorrow morning five live breakfast we'll tell you everything you need to know that's happening you know John Liverpool have had huge injuries they need their players back because you look at the table they're in fourth place Everton two games in hand and only three points behind Liverpool and you look at you know Chelsea and the two-co you know game and hands four points behind so Liverpool will have to get some form here because the Champions League John who'd have thought Liverpool not qualifying for the Champions League well thinkable free kick Sheffield takes it down into the full back position and Liverpool unusually this week because they're out of the FA Cup actually have a break this week but when it gets going again for them next Saturday lest they're away and then the Champions League the week after that when if you haven't heard their first leg it's going to be played in in Bruder pest in Hungary because of the the Covid difficulties against RB Leipzig that's not an easy tie by any means so um city with a throw in now a corner it is actually it's been won after Ike Oliver says no hang on it is a throw going to get the team news from Sheffield United them in a moment or two but let's just hang on just in case City are able to get another one here and you certainly wouldn't count against it but Liverpool win the ball back in attack with Wijnaldum who plays it forward that Foden their scorer of that excellent goal is found. It's been magnificent best play on the park Phil Foden John absolutely magnificent can only agree with that Robbie. Liverpool won Manchester City four so let's get the team news from John Aikos who's at Bramble Lane for our Sheffield United Chelsea commentary. Ben Chilwell is back in the Chelsea lineup as one of three changes by Thomas Tuchel. Christensen also comes in and also Giroud for his 250th Premier League appearance outgo Tiago Silva Alonso's on the bench and Hudson Adoye who's also on the bench and four for Sheffield United out Ampadou can't play against his parent club Baldock, Sharp and McGoldrick in come Brian Lowe, McBurney and Burke. The final whistle goals at Anfield the champions have been beaten by the Premier League leaders Manchester City by four goals to one what a shattering defeat this is for Jurgen Klopp and his team. Absolutely incredible mistakes drama Phil Foden sensational performance Liverpool have injuries yesterday the teams you know all over the place players playing out of position but City dominated the game the only disappointment for Pep was they've conceded a goal and but other than that Liverpool just not playing well City brilliant title race over John Murray and all after Manchester City missed a penalty before halftime Ilkai Gundawan but in the second half goodness me they made up for that Gundawan made up for it he scored twice Sterling scored Foden scored Salah from the penalty spot briefly made it one-one but this Manchester City team are right in their stride this is 14 wins in a row in all competitions they've won 10 successive matches in the Premier League they've opened a five-point lead at the top they're 10 points ahead of Liverpool and they've won Manchester City at Anfield for the first time since 2003 it has comprehensively been their day it's finished Liverpool one Manchester City four and remarkably that is three back-to-back defeats for Liverpool and field since they went 68 games unbeaten Burnley shocked them Brighton stunned them today Robbie Savage Manchester City have smashed them it's the first time isn't it in the Premier League either that's Liverpool have lost three home games in a row this yeah they absolutely tore them apart listen Alison's mistakes he probably won't do that again all season but the way you know Jurgen Klopp wants his team to play he does it so well he'll bounce back from that the big question is now for 606 Steve is will Liverpool's home form you know they need their players back you look at Everton you look at Chelsea now under Thomas Tugol you look at Aston Villa if they win their two games and they go above Liverpool before the start of the season we just said right with 15 games to go Liverpool have got significant injuries will they get a Champions League place wow all five nine six nine three for later Steve that isn't quite incredible but Steve what about Phil Fordham what about Gunderman Phil Fordham was unbelievable with I'm just looking at the message we're getting 85058 at five live sport AJ Phil Foden the kid the kid is clear he's got to start for England at the Euros Reese is reminding us that Phil Foden was only three the last time Manchester City won at Anfield that the power on that strike I mean if if there was ever a way to cap an absolutely merciless performance it was that yeah you know the first half didn't really get going you know the missed penalty but then the second half it's just the way they played you know moving you know before the game myself and Pat were talking about Phil Fordham and how well he's done out wide and you know Pat said inevitably the long term he'll be playing central he started central today yes in a in a force nine position you know but then when he moved out wide they couldn't stop him he was sensational I guess what he's going to make this doubly difficult to take if your Liverpool Robbie is that I mean there were errors and we've mentioned the Alisson error but ultimately they've lost four one in a game where Manchester City gave them two absolute gifts a missed penalty and an error from from Diaz that we've just never seen coming over the course of his career at City so far yeah what was social media saying Steve on on the penalty you know that I listened there was a little bit of content on Salah what were they saying well I spent all of my time in the first half looking up your yellow cards Robbie so I couldn't tell you I mean the one thing I would say about it is it's not just a penalty is it if if Diaz puts enough into Salah to bring him down if he impedes him at all it's a penalty but ultimately in the end it's made no difference has it no it's made no difference at all just the way City moved the ball the way they got in between the lines just the way you know they threatened Liverpool the biggest thing was I listened to Thomas Tuchel saying about Chelsea you know when he was excited about winning the recovery in the ball in the opposition's final third City done that a lot today didn't they against this Liverpool side they pressed them they hassled them they hurried them and Allyson yes he made two errors and you know but that's the way you want your team to play there will be errors but just with his right foot you know across himself it was just bizarre mistakes I'm just reading Johnson Quartz from from Phil Forden on TV he's already spoken since that goal and the victory talking about does he enjoy playing in the false 90 said yeah I enjoy it you can drop in you don't have to stay up front you can move it's something that I need to learn I can make it part of my game I wonder if if false nine is actually almost the perfect position for Phil Forden because you can do what you want with it and he's such an instinctive player I don't know I think personally I would say central really in that attacking in the sort of Kevin De Bruyne position either either side of the rotary but I mean he can play there can't he can play other side of of rotary he can play on the left up front he can play on the right up front and he can play in this role as well he is truly versatile he is a very very good footballer I mean he can play anywhere Robbie you could put anywhere and he would have a massive impact he could play anywhere on the on the on the park no question about it if he was left back right backs you know I'm not sure he'd have the discipline the players and set her up but he probably would because he just loves playing with the football is that clip isn't it on social media when he is in the street in Stockport with his mates with the ball doing all tricks and that's how he plays on the pitch in the Premier League no fear you know wow what a performance but his best work was out wide it was magnificent that's the those are the sort of players that you're going to be looking for in your foundation Robbie oh yes yeah John thank you very much but that's you know that's the idea isn't it yeah to get those kids just who are who play on the streets yeah and develop them yeah that's and that you know it's it is it's genuinely heartwarming to see a local player yeah I know you were talking Steve in the early part of the programme and on the football daily this morning about local players who come through and and and it's that sort of player isn't it the supporters want to see playing for their team yeah absolutely and you know we're now not far away from the stage Robbie you know we've had so many discussions we had another one today about what Phil Forden has learned from David Silver it's not going to be long before other players are trying to learn from Phil Forden if they know already yeah it's not just what he's learned from David Silver is what he's learned from Bernardo Silver from Gundewan from Kevin de Bruyne from Sergio Aguero from Riyad Márez from Raheem Sterling you know all those players he's learning off you know in his education you know his development of Man City you know what a player Pep Guardiola you've got to give him huge amounts of credit for the way you know when all the questions why is he playing should he go out alone you know he knew what he was doing and now you're seeing it he is absolutely sensational and we talk a lot about mentality and we usually talk about mentality to do with Liverpool and of course there's that that famous line which became a little bit of a cliche in the end around mentality monsters well if you want to talk about mentality we're talking today about Ilkai Gundewan aren't we to miss a penalty that badly in a game of this significance and then come back and have that second half yeah you were hammering them at half time when you're saying I said he was past six relax relax relax yeah I'm brilliant you know one of his best scenes I think is this his best score scoring season John? Yes, best scoring season yeah but 11 goals John said it every single city player is playing to probably need enough their best of their ability there's not one bad play in a city shoot in the last was it 14 or 15 games John? Yeah it's 14 they've won in a row now I think if you're going to be very picky you might say mares you know perhaps you could see better form from him and listen what I'm doing there is you're harsh no but I'm making the point that he's probably the only one out of that team that started today that is not in rich form. Robbie before we let you go what do you want people to call in for six or six later on this now? Well you've got to say city title's over for me that top four is it unthinkable that Liverpool might not end up in a champions league position? Wow. Oh wait I wait five nine oh nine six nine three. Yeah can't wait for that later tonight nine p.m. Robbie thank you very much. He's off. Thank you mate. That was fast. Almost out the door. Oh almost out the door. Robbie Savage is hurtling his way back it's about a now a trip probably back to media city but he will be back for six or six a little bit later. That was the Russell if I'm taking his mini eggs with him as well. Oh wow he's left you with nothing John. Left with nothing as usual and you've got to stay with us for a while as well. Wow what a result. Liverpool won Manchester City four in the Premier League loads more reaction coming to that as you can imagine then we'll get into Sheffield United Chelsea which kicks off in 45 minutes time. We'll bring you live reaction as soon as we get it from Anfield. We're going to bring in shortly Ben Haynes from 90 Minin Leon Osmond who is at Bramble Lane for us for that late game for more discussion on what we've just seen and why have we just seen 85058 at Five Live Sport let us know what you're thinking after witnessing that at Anfield.

Liverpool one Manchester City for incredible afternoon in the Premier League at Anfield. This then is now how the top of the table looks Manchester City top played 22 50 points. All of the teams below them down to West Ham in fifth have played a game more. So Manchester United second 45 points. Lester third on 43. Liverpool fourth on 40 and then West Ham fifth on 39. John Murray is with us from Anfield our correspondent and Juliet Farrington will bring us live reaction as soon as we get it from both sides. Also joining us we've got Ben Haynes from 90 minutes. Good evening Ben. That's Steve Haye doing you're at me. Yeah I'm all right in a little bit of shock. I think and we also have with us the former Everton and England midfielder Leon Osmond who's at Bramble lane for us tonight evening Leon. Good evening. Well I tell you what let's just start by getting you know immediate reaction from from the two of you Leon to what we've just seen. Well surprised first of all the fact that you know Liverpool have conceded four goals at home. I can't even remember the last time the last time that happened. You know they did break their score in duck which again is another surprising run that they're on albeit from a penalty kick. They're just not the same side at the moment in Manchester City went there full of confidence and took full advantage. It was amazing seeing that second half play out wasn't it considering the fact that so often these games turning to sort of damp squibs and there's a huge build up and then suddenly you see Neil near a halftime you're thinking oh well this is a nothing and then suddenly it just burst into life like that. I was wondering Leon did you ever any thoughts on sort of why it happened because it looked as if Pep Guardiola might have just changed things a bit gone with the two up top just open the game up maybe. I think the tactical change he made was to move Phil Foden into a wider position you know he's played there quite a number of times in recent weeks and been very very good but I thought it was just you know it was as if the two teams were sort of weighing each other up in the first half just trying to get to halftime without having overexposed themselves and then in the second half they just stepped it up and you know when you've got. Stand by Leon We're going to go live down to Julie at pitch side. Yeah I'm just waiting I can see him Ilkai Gundewan is about to enter the stage. I say the stage because we're right next to the goal here at the Cop at Anfield and he's just taking his face covering off Ilkai. What can I say can you just sum up that game you missed the penalty but but two goals as well. Yeah I mean obviously I'm very happy that we've won this game I think we fully deserved it we played great especially the second half in the half where we concede the equaliser. I think we did really well apart from the penalty I don't think they had any chance to score a goal and I think we moved the ball very well we deserved to score a few more goals and all in one I think it was a great performance. What about your own performance like because obviously we saw the penalty miss and Manchester City penalties against Liverpool this does seem to be a problem but then obviously you make you become a hero straight away. Yeah I mean I need to admit that missing a penalty is always a bad thing rubbish I mean I mean especially early in the game there's always a danger of dropping confidence but I try just I just try to do after after missing it just try to do the the simple things as good as possible as I always try to do try to don't get disrupted by by that penalty and just try to try to keep going helping my team yeah to win here and it worked out quite well maybe I was a bit lucky to be in the right spaces but I always try to be there you know when I when I smell there there could be a danger in front of the opponent's goal and yeah of course I'm happy about the two goals and it was maybe also kind of a relief but I'm much much much much happier about the result and about the way we've played. Seafield Folder just walking away I mean everybody wants to speak to him as well the build up to your to the second goal and and the part he had to play in that. Yeah Phil deserves all all the credit he's doing he's doing really well I think compared to to the last season he stepped up this game again this season and he's still so young we can't forget that and yeah there's still a lot a lot to come for him and I'm obviously very happy to have him in our team he gives us an incredible an incredible quality and yeah it's just great to see to see that Yankee playing. You said you could have scored more as a team and you you deserve to score more that was a real statement of intent from Manchester City the points difference between you and Liverpool now at the top of the table your 10 points clear of Liverpool the the grip you have in this title race is it yours? No it's definitely not we need to stay humble we know that we need to put performance like that every single game because every single game is tough doesn't matter if it's away at Anfield or playing home against a Sheffield United who is at the moment bottom of the league you know but who have also incredible qualities so even that game playing in our own stadium was so tight and so close that every single game has its own character and his own challenges and we need to take every single one and just need to keep going like like we did today and then I think it's gonna gonna be a great season for us. That's 14 wins in a row Ilkay that's that's good going that's brilliant going. That's good yeah it's good and obviously the aim the target is to keep going not just in terms of the result in terms of in terms of playing like that and if we do so the results will come automatically. Well we wish you well thank you very much for your time it's freezing thank you thank you. Ilkay Gundawan who scored twice at Anfield this afternoon live on Premier League Sunday with Juliet Farrington I love that John I mean he talked about the simple things the simple things like scoring two at Anfield in a half. He's an impressive character Gundawan I've interviewed him myself several times very thoughtful he's a clever guy as well as being a superb footballer who is having his best season I think it would be fair to say since he's come to Manchester City and you know that's against a fairly high bar that he's had over the years but as I suggested during the commentary it almost seems as though he's emerged from the the the shadow of David Silva who you'd expect to do all of the beautiful things and now he's doing lots of beautiful things as well with the football and scoring good goals and I think that gave us as well an insight into his psyche as well and how he thinks about the game and you know the standard the level of a top class footballer. Yeah do you know Leon I was thinking as I listened to that it was quite impressive that he picked himself up from the penalty miss to have that second half but actually when you listen to him talk you think yeah I can understand how someone with your character was able to put that to one side. Yeah it just seems so calm and so steady doesn't he and you know doesn't seem to be affected by individual errors or mistakes that happen within a game he knows the goal of the team he knows what his part in that is and he's he's wanting to go and go out and show that on the field and you know as John said he's been in terrific form of late you know he really has been that you know even when Kevin De Bruyne was fit it was Gunduan it was probably still the standout player and since he's been injured you know he's he's took the reins and really run with them you know then you wonder who else is going to you know want to be the main man and Phil Foden you know you can't say that he's not stepped up and showing everybody that they're right to believe in the hype that he's had since he was a young man he's really developed into into a top player this talk should he be playing more central but at the moment if he's performing like he is in those wider areas for Pep Guardiola then I'd keep him there. The thing that links the two together Ben and I'm talking about Foden and Gunduan here is they're both players who at times have had to settle for a place on the bench under Pep Guardiola and yet they're both players who have shown what they can do when they are you so that is all testament to the manager and keeping players happy even though their world class are not always playing. Yeah there are testament to their patience as well because there was so much talk wasn't there about Phil Foden about whether he needed to go elsewhere or that perhaps he needed to go somewhere on loan and he consistently said the entire time that he felt as if his time has come and he was going to get game time and I think Pep Guardiola has been really clever because he gradually integrated him hasn't he he's gradually seen him drifting to to more and more game time and in multiple positions as well he's not just popped him in one place and said look that's your spot he's drifted across the entire at the front line playing deeper as well and I have to say today with Phil Foden the thing that impressed me most is just the way that he carried himself he looked like he belonged on that stage there were times where he was sort of holding off for being you know chest puffed out winning free kicks in dangerous areas and then as well as that I mean the the composure and the technique on his finish was just absolutely stunning as well. I'm not sure you know whether that was then a genuinely an option or something that was talked about within Manchester City in terms of sending Foden out on loan because over the years and it is years now that we've seen him develop whenever I've listened to Guardiola and admittedly this is when he's speaking publicly he's always been quite steadfast in that he felt that the best place for him to develop was at City and to be around those players whether you know certainly in training and the influence etc etc and that he would he would get his chance and okay you know you're right it has it's taken it feels like it's taken a long time for him to get to the position that that he is now but he's there now isn't he? He believed in his qualities John didn't he? And what he didn't want and I remember him saying publicly he didn't want him to go and learn I'm not going to say bad habits but habits that aren't what Pep wants you know Pep wants to teach him how he wants him to play he doesn't want him to go on loan and learn how another manager wants him to play he wants him to develop in his style and you know I've been saying for years you don't need to go out and play on loan if you you've got a trusted manager if you've got those quality players around you there's sometimes people are in such a rush to make it into the first team I didn't get in regular till I was 23 and you know played till I was 35 so you know there's there's such a long time ahead for Phil Fode in his career he's still developing he's still got an awful long way and he will develop and change positions throughout his career because he's such an intelligent footballing as has Pep's done showing him different roles different positions false nine out wide on the right within the game today we've seen him play left we've seen him play deep you know think of the player he'll be you know when he really hits his peak in his mid to late 20s he's he's always spoken of him Guardiola as though he is a very special case I've heard him do it many times and and because it's Guardiola when he talks about Fode in the way that he has you think wow you know he he must be special well I can remember John I interviewed Bernardo Silva probably about a year ago and he said within two years I think Phil Foden will be one of the best in the world which kind of paints a picture I think doesn't it of sometimes someone is just so good you perhaps don't need to worry about saying it yeah but very often players and certainly managers would shy away wouldn't they of saying that sort of thing publicly but but with Foden they haven't and did you see the way they celebrated that fourth goal when he scored even Edison came running up the pitch it wasn't just delight that they'd scored the fourth or delight that they'd won the game they were genuinely delighted that Phil Foden was the guy who'd done it and he showed his quality on the field if you watch back the joy in each one of those Manchester City's faces they were rubbing him on the head like he's you know a little brother that they've all really pleased he's come to the fore and you know they know his quality they all believe in him within the club and now everyone else will too double figures that is now for Foden this season for City 10 goals I've got uh I've got some quotes here Ben actually from Pep Guardiola on Phil Foden and interesting actually this is this is kind of the opposite of the discussion we've just had so having just watched that performance Pep has said this um he can get distracted easily he's still learning the rule he was out of position in the first half we know what huge talent he is but he's still young and he needs to learn now that's very interesting given what we've just discussed but I also think it's interesting that if Pep's willing to say that to the media he will have said that much more strongly to Foden himself at half time and he obviously reacted but that's a massive compliment isn't it the moment you see your manager's prepared to come out and say something like that off the back of a performance that was that good it almost implied there's a level I've just got to jump in because we've just heard some Pep quotes let's hear from the man himself he's with Jules hello Pep yes it is absolutely freezing um they're having a conversation the guys in the studio and the commentary team about Phil Foden we know what we can do you've spoken so much about him he belonged on that stage today didn't he his performance his composure yeah when playing the site when playing the mirror he was not in the position should be but this because he's young because it's special but of course in the when he played in the side the action for the second goal and the four was phenomenal you said in the past about him that you wanted him to develop at Manchester City there wasn't really that option to take him out on loan you wanted him to learn there how much more learning has he got to do because he just looks world-class at times Phil yes yeah we knew it from when I arrived here he has 16 years old Chiqui Bergrestine my sport my lovely sport director told me there is one guy you will love it I said okay take your time and after a while with 17 I think he came up to training and we saw something especially unique but he has to understand sometimes the game when playing inside and it's a little more time especially the tempo he always play in one tempo that is so good for the winger but in the middle has another tempo you have to make variations sometimes you have to play as slowly sometimes quicker and he's still not perfect on the sense and it's but with this joy to play with his ambition and his focus to learn he will get it how much do you drive him on because you speak to him so publicly in the media and maybe things that he could develop but privately how much do you drive him on talk to him and understand so we can talk and other times you realize when he can do it he can do it because the rest of the quality one against one the shoot is brilliant okay 14 wins in a row how much of a statement was that performance for our mind it's so good changing the Premier League like everyone you know how we struggle to win games everyone and but today I promise you we're going to celebrate it but tomorrow our feats will be on the grass again because in February no one is champion and and like I cannot predict the future all I can predict is work and work and work harder to to make a good game against Swansea and Tottenham but Pep you're winning and winning surely you are tightening that grip yeah but winning yeah of course I'm saying so I'm so grateful I I cannot more worse to to be grateful and thanks to these players but it's the past we have done brilliantly so I cannot deny it we're so happy but we are in February still we are in the second or third games on the second leg but for us for Manchester City especially you know three points but come here finally win it's important thank you very much for your time Pep thank you Pep Guardiola live on Premier League Sunday um so much of that I thought was fascinating Ben but that what he said about his lovely sporting director Chiki Burgistan you know we're talking about a guy there who Chiki Burgistan became a director at Barcelona a year before Lionel Messi broke through so he's seen a kid of that quality and Pep's there saying on his first day Phil Foden is the guy that Chiki Burgistan is telling him about Steve you're leading me down a dangerous path no no I'm not trying to I'm not trying to I'm not trying to do that I'm just saying he knows a player that's what I was going for absolutely yeah and I mean with a performance like that it's very difficult to argue with the idea that Phil Foden is not going to be a special special talent in a couple years time what we I was just saying directly before we went to Pep was I think that's such a compliment when he's prepared to come out and make bold statements like that about where Phil Foden needs to improve I don't think he would do that unless he felt Foden was a big enough character and a smart enough player to actually integrate those changes within his game and you get the impression it's it's probably times five times ten behind closed doors as well and probably a little bit more of a ruthless message but the fact that he's prepared to do it publicly publicly I think is massive at this stage in Foden's development it's also interestingly Leon that Pep Guardiola doesn't just kind of say that yes he was good but the team the team the team he's more than happy just to sort of stand there and kind of wax lyrical about a very special young man I think when you've got the individuals that he has got you know there are occasions when you have to come out and talk about their brilliance and you know today was a day for I'll try Gunda one it was a day for sorry Leon I'm doing it again it always seems to be you Jules has got Jurgen Klopp with her I almost have Jurgen Klopp with me the Liverpool manager he's about to make his way to hello can I what can you say Jurgen I can't hear you you know that I have to shout oh yeah is this social distancing okay here we go what what can you say Jurgen about about this afternoon so one thing is the result obviously absolutely rubbish for one losing for one in a game like this is really exactly opposite of what we wanted the other thing is the performance and the performance was in big parts of the game really really good at least level we've caused city a lot of problems played a really good game and if you would have played more often this season like we played in these parts we would not be 10 or 13 points behind city but that's all it's not important I think first half at least level really good half top football both sides really interesting to watch for both sides coming out for three four minutes I don't know exactly we are not that active as we were before concede the goal in that it could be the offside goal maybe whatever concede the goal in that in that period strike back score the equalizer and then it looked yeah could have gone our direction and then we make two massive mistakes which obviously cost cost the game tonight and yeah that's how it is and that was so so uncharacteristic of allison as well I think for the second guard he got well I watched him he got a water bottle he just poured water over over his head as if to think what am I doing sort of thing that's live of professional sports people at you may in that moment nobody thinks anymore about how good you are and stuff like this you're how can that happen but we are so he saved our life plenty of times and tonight yeah of course he was part of these two goals definitely so but we take that so we have this this game is gone so I saw a lot of good things what I really liked and after we had to show a few things as a reaction as well from the last game and the boys did the boys did that but then when you concede these goals they obviously a mood killer it's not like who cares that strike back that's not these kind of goals it's really good everybody was like my god okay that's really strange and so we lost the game now but we'll carry on they're just tough times aren't they? Liverpool's just going through a tough time sorry? Liverpool is just going through a tough time oh yes a tough time definitely it's a tough time definitely but again we what I saw tonight this team will go again and that's all I need thank you very much Jürgen Jürgen Klopp live on Premier League Sunday there with with Juliet Farrington we've got Ben Haynes from 90 Million Leone Osmond and our correspondent John Murray with us on Premier League Sunday it's always interesting John to hear from Jürgen Klopp but I think sometimes a Sai says more than anything else yeah and listen he said there at the end this team will go again and I'm sure it will and as we talked earlier about the the important players that they're missing and the fact that they need to get the balance back in the team but in terms of the the title race this season I'm just looking at his notes Jürgen Klopp's notes in the in the match program today and he he's talking about the rivalry between Manchester City and and Liverpool and he says there have been moments where it's felt like a scene from a rocky film where Balboa and Apollo Creed are just trading punches but neither will go to the canvas in terms of this season's title race you can finish that analogy yourself yeah more like rocky five um Leone this the stats you know there's there's loads of them flying around but this is quite a good one I think 23 games into last season Liverpool were 19 points clear 23 games into this one they're 10 points behind and I know you know it's very easy the conversation could quite easily and you know reasonably go back to the injury to Virgil Bandai but that is an incredible climb down for Liverpool over the course of the season well of course it is you know there's no there's no getting away from that but you know we were treated to you know three incredible seasons of 98 99 and 100 points you know and suddenly we we forget that you know teams win the Premier League with three or four defeats okay Liverpool have have just in a bad run and had more than that but it was inevitable that the Premier League especially this season wasn't going to take 100 points to win it it's going to it's going to be more you know probably mid 80s maybe um so that was going to happen to to a side like Liverpool but you know I think the the way they've sort of lost their confidence and lost their way in the last month or so the fact that suddenly the most poked-and-striked force in certainly in the Premier League is struggling to find opportunities is you know it's something that nobody would have predicted you know the fact that Burnley and Brighton and now Manchester City have all gone to Anfield and won three games on the run after their incredible home run again no one would have predicted so you know Jurgen Klopp needs to find a way of somehow getting past this getting through it so getting confidence back within his side because you know I think it's more Liverpool's doing than other teams and even Manchester City I think Manchester City have been terrific but they've been Manchester City it's Liverpool who've fallen away and that's been the difference Steve you mentioned Jurgen Klopp's side there at the beginning of the interview do you know what's really interesting is I don't think I've ever heard him off the back of a defeat sort of just so sort of accepting of it just very flat very kind of you know we made a couple of big mistakes I've just been meeting four one at Anfield like I don't know why but I'm sort of expecting the Jurgen Klopp of a few weeks ago to come out sort of swinging there a little bit and making a fairly passionate defence of his side or explaining where things have gone wrong and it's sort of I mean perhaps that's that's credit to Man City maybe it's just the fact that Man City played that well in the second half um but for me I think if I was in his shoes I'd be seriously seriously annoyed with the fact that you work so hard to get back into the game and then two errors from one of your best players gives the game to Man City well Benny he also said you know that the two teams were very good in the first half I didn't agree with that I thought both teams were pretty pretty flat and pretty ordinary in the first half sort of weighing each other up and then he said that his team came out and were below their level at the start of the second half and Manchester City stole a lead on them and I think Manchester City just stepped it up a little bit I think you know I think that was the difference I think both teams were flat in the first half Man City stepped up the level the level and Liverpool didn't go with them and you know as you said then to get back in the game I mean even Jurgen Klopp was talking about offside goals within there they've just been beat 4-1 at home um you know you can see it's frustrated but you know his team are playing below par his goalkeeper is giving two howlers away in in a big huge game once they've got back level so something's clearly not right at Liverpool and Jurgen Klopp will be wanting to find out what it is as quick as he can 8 5 0 5 8 at 5 live sport Charlie says you wonder how much last season's title win has taken out of Liverpool they just look so jaded Ryan says to avoid City having to make another non-essential journey just let them take the trophy with them tonight I'm not sure the question necessarily should be given where Manchester United are whether the title race is over the question Ben has got to be whether Liverpool's title race is over yeah I you don't want to write off Liverpool do you it feels at this stage it feels very naive to even suggest that Liverpool are out there is let alone some of the chat around top four I I just can't buy into it I can't get my head around the idea that we're considering that Liverpool won't be in the top four this season having said that the way that man City are playing it's really difficult to get to veer away from the idea of man City being in this robotic sort of fashion that they are at the moment man City are managing to share the goals around and share the big performances around their front six they're not relying on one player to go out and dig them out of a hole they're sharing the goals around everywhere and Pep Guardiola is making changes all over the pitch and people just slotting into the system as if they've been playing that way for for weeks even when they haven't been involved Liverpool are sort of the antithesis of that we keep talking about how much they're missing players so maybe their races run but it still feels just a little bit premature to write them off yeah I don't think it's time to write Liverpool off just as you said you know we you spoke about it yourself John in the commentary about you felt Liverpool had to win you know that's the case there's so many games left in the season at the start of the season Liverpool had a good start Manchester City were probably roughly about 10 points behind Liverpool and you know that's changed around to such the extent it has within the season so there's enough games left it's just that Manchester City's form just looks so I'm gonna sit the moment doesn't it thank you very I'll go on John sorry yeah just I'm actually listening to Pep Guardiola at the moment as well in in one year who's doing his media conference and he's been asked about whether he might consider Edison as a penalty taker right and and Guardiola says when I mentioned that after the match today he said it's now a half joke he said when I mentioned it six months ago as he did it was a joke but he says now it's a half joke because they don't really have a specialist in this area he says so so we might so we might say because they've missed they've now missed they've
