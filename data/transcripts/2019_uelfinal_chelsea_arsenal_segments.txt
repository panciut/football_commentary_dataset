[0.00 - 8.16] P:2052.26 E:0.009737 |  It will not be a full house in Baku, it's a big stadium but still a large crowd somewhere
[8.16 - 11.64] P:1968.93 E:0.023499 |  in the region of 60,000 or so.
[11.64 - 16.84] P:1755.67 E:0.037529 |  It's blue against red, it's Chelsea against Arsenal and at a budget we are almost ready
[16.84 - 18.72] P:1778.53 E:0.037902 |  to get on the way.
[18.72 - 20.04] P:1869.82 E:0.052401 |  It just seems so surreal.
[20.04 - 26.36] P:1998.83 E:0.060274 |  Here we are in the Europa League final, Arsenal beat Chelsea and a stadium that's not full
[26.36 - 29.16] P:2039.06 E:0.067335 |  and I look back on the history of this game.
[29.16 - 34.00] P:2051.28 E:0.084503 |  So many classic encounters and yet we have only one Englishman starting so it's a, it
[34.00 - 40.04] P:2042.62 E:0.098152 |  kind of feels kind of strange but so important for both clubs tonight, for Sarri the manager
[40.04 - 45.32] P:1994.89 E:0.110788 |  and for Arsenal to get that champion league spot, massive, massive game and I'm really
[45.32 - 46.32] P:2065.25 E:0.109524 |  looking forward to it.
[46.32 - 51.44] P:1931.94 E:0.099930 |  Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang stands inside the centre circle, he'll be the man to get this
[51.44 - 54.80] P:1744.50 E:0.109987 |  Europa League final started.
[54.96 - 60.88] P:1960.81 E:0.114697 |  Chelsea, Arsenal have already released plans to hold a trophy parade in Islington tomorrow
[60.88 - 62.88] P:1821.09 E:0.099961 |  if they are the team who triumphs.
[62.88 - 66.12] P:1766.84 E:0.100225 |  Chelsea players had a little giggle of that in the press conference yesterday, they'll
[66.12 - 68.24] P:1704.83 E:0.100952 |  be setting out to ensure it doesn't happen.
[68.24 - 72.40] P:1730.15 E:0.104778 |  In Golo Kante gets a touch of the ball for the first time, 10 yards inside the Arsenal
[72.40 - 77.72] P:1677.93 E:0.102951 |  half, Chelsea play it back to David Louise who was involved in that scuffle between
[77.72 - 82.76] P:1712.50 E:0.102239 |  team-mates on the pitch here last night, well publicised moment which led to Maurizio
[82.80 - 89.32] P:1755.91 E:0.102659 |  Sarri storming off the pitch, will there be a reaction from Chelsea tonight as it's played
[89.32 - 95.48] P:1785.49 E:0.101326 |  in field by Aspel Aquetta and Chelsea get it out to the left-hand side and Emerson
[95.48 - 100.04] P:1750.96 E:0.102972 |  will give you a reminder of the full teams when we get a break in play but Kovicic back
[100.04 - 103.96] P:1840.63 E:0.107790 |  into his own half, it's all Chelsea, Arsenal having had a touch so far, David Louise pings
[103.96 - 110.28] P:1946.47 E:0.109691 |  a long-range ball looking for Petro, had a huge roar from the Arsenal fans as Petticec
[110.32 - 114.64] P:1822.18 E:0.102628 |  comes out and it was a comfortable save but they just love that he's had a positive first
[114.64 - 115.64] P:1871.00 E:0.098610 |  touch.
[115.64 - 119.28] P:1815.48 E:0.108222 |  Yeah, I think that's what Peter would have liked, a nice floaty ball to come out and
[119.28 - 123.16] P:1836.78 E:0.105440 |  collect but it's interesting already the two Chelsea fullbacks are going to get a lot of
[123.16 - 129.08] P:1879.41 E:0.103509 |  space tonight and I can notice there was right out on the touch line trying to stretch this
[129.08 - 132.52] P:1801.47 E:0.105439 |  Arsenal team so an interesting tactical point at the start.
[132.52 - 136.76] P:1811.82 E:0.105089 |  Jack plays it out to Montréal just outside the Arsenal penalty area, there was a heavy
[136.76 - 141.40] P:1736.80 E:0.105252 |  touch there I think by Granada Jack but he recovered to clear it long into the Chelsea
[141.40 - 142.40] P:1735.93 E:0.076905 |  half.
[142.40 - 147.80] P:1765.64 E:0.103440 |  Chelsea gained possession with the Dane, Andreas Christensen who helps it back to keeper Rita
[147.80 - 149.80] P:1738.11 E:0.096732 |  Balaga the Spaniard.
[149.80 - 154.44] P:1746.30 E:0.111656 |  Well, quite a high profile season particularly those scenes.
[154.44 - 160.92] P:1775.48 E:0.104426 |  The last time Chelsea played in a final, the League Cup final when he refused to be substituted.
[160.92 - 164.72] P:1783.22 E:0.098439 |  Chelsea lost to Manchester City on spot kicks in the end.
[164.72 - 168.36] P:1749.73 E:0.106221 |  We could have penalties tonight in Baku one way or the other, we get a winner tonight
[168.36 - 174.20] P:1869.48 E:0.101761 |  as a miscue in defence by Socrates but Azar isn't able to bounce on it but Jack had a
[174.20 - 180.04] P:1864.53 E:0.102272 |  miscue, Socrates had a miscue, Arsenal's defence which is always a worry for them, it hasn't
[180.04 - 183.56] P:1716.72 E:0.107847 |  had a completely 100% solid start here so far.
[183.56 - 187.56] P:1822.55 E:0.103339 |  Early stages, two minutes played in Baku, Chelsea did Arsenal now.
[187.56 - 192.36] P:1899.24 E:0.110804 |  Yeah, I think Chelsea just thought I'm a move of the ball, it was interesting to see Ozil
[192.36 - 196.88] P:1815.46 E:0.112963 |  go around Drogenio and Drogenio still managed to get his pass off, he just needs a little,
[196.88 - 201.56] P:1783.61 E:0.108849 |  you know, that kind of lazy style that Ozil has defensively, he's going to need to be
[201.56 - 203.84] P:1838.54 E:0.104396 |  on his game today for sure.
[203.84 - 210.68] P:1768.50 E:0.100820 |  Lovely clearance from keeper Rita Balaga, but Kovačić unable to keep it in play and
[210.68 - 214.72] P:1917.97 E:0.114495 |  Arsenal win possession here for the first time really in the Chelsea half.
[214.72 - 220.72] P:1869.64 E:0.101733 |  Played in field, Jack along to Montréal, bogged down in the midfield though it's taken
[220.72 - 224.64] P:1834.71 E:0.096761 |  time to spread it out to Kolasinac to the far side.
[224.64 - 229.72] P:1783.51 E:0.105732 |  Aspelik Kweta comes close to Kip Tamsen even, Arsenal forced back again to the halfway
[229.72 - 234.84] P:1747.55 E:0.115798 |  line and Laurent Kishelny was injured in the semi-final of the Europa League last season,
[234.84 - 239.40] P:1797.81 E:0.112524 |  ended up missing the World Cup as a result which of course his nation France went on
[239.40 - 244.64] P:1901.56 E:0.107081 |  to win this time round and he's got further than the Europa League semis, here he is
[244.64 - 249.12] P:1751.87 E:0.095600 |  captaining his side in the final itself, it will drag back for the Frenchman.
[249.12 - 253.96] P:1796.33 E:0.098371 |  Low ball into the midfield to Lucas Torreira, just short of the halfway line, right hand
[253.96 - 259.12] P:1860.83 E:0.110430 |  side as Arsenal come forward, heavy touch by Maitland Niles, Azard is in to try and bounce
[259.12 - 264.36] P:1817.21 E:0.101467 |  on it and then Maitland Niles fouls in and Azard free kick to Chelsea just inside the
[264.36 - 265.76] P:1777.30 E:0.096209 |  Arsenal half, Alain Parjik.
[265.76 - 271.28] P:1821.45 E:0.105433 |  Yeah, just a few too many errors from Arsenal's final view in possession, but the game's settling
[271.28 - 275.92] P:1762.11 E:0.102041 |  down both obviously two different systems, so one just trying to dictate to the other,
[275.92 - 281.40] P:1850.10 E:0.108678 |  Chelsea just got the line share at the moment and again a mistake there and now Arsenal
[281.40 - 284.08] P:1868.40 E:0.103707 |  in position again, just trying to settle down the game.
[284.08 - 290.16] P:1785.14 E:0.101840 |  You see Unai Emery stride out to the edge of the technical area, Mr Europa League in
[290.16 - 296.48] P:1818.58 E:0.103082 |  many respects, he has won this competition more than any other manager 2014, 2015, 2016
[296.48 - 300.88] P:1834.44 E:0.103813 |  with Sevilla's Montréal clears it away for Arsenal, up over the halfway line stretching
[300.88 - 305.84] P:1822.95 E:0.104246 |  Christianson managers to keep it in play and now in Golo Cante with a touch and again
[305.88 - 310.60] P:1851.60 E:0.103256 |  just like the warm up, you're feeling Golo Cante isn't exerting himself here, the bare
[310.60 - 315.00] P:1821.19 E:0.108230 |  minimum there is he kept it moving in the midfield and Chelsea get it to their danger
[315.00 - 320.00] P:1837.08 E:0.106865 |  at, Eden Azard, midway inside the Arsenal half, sets off an amazing dribble, turns back
[320.00 - 326.24] P:1788.95 E:0.097054 |  at himself short of the penalty area, support from Covacic and now back to the centre circle
[326.24 - 331.76] P:1837.19 E:0.097709 |  once again and Chelsea will start from scratch, Christianson, little dummy by Azard but nobody's
[331.76 - 337.24] P:1856.23 E:0.099829 |  behind him to take it and Maitland Niles will help it back to Petticec, so a reminder of
[337.24 - 342.72] P:1788.70 E:0.094710 |  the teams, Caporita Balaga the goalkeeper for Chelsea, they are officially the home
[342.72 - 348.48] P:1826.09 E:0.102299 |  team in terms of UEFA designation despite being two and a half thousand miles away from home,
[348.48 - 354.04] P:1817.95 E:0.102477 |  Aspel Aquetta, Christianson, Luis and Emerson the back four, Cante, Giorginho, at Covacic
[354.04 - 359.88] P:1693.87 E:0.102609 |  in the midfield, Pedro, Giroux and Azard the three up front, for Arsenal Petticec is the
[360.00 - 366.20] P:1827.90 E:0.099941 |  goalkeeper, three central defenders for them, Socrates, Kishelny and Monreal, Maitland Niles
[366.20 - 371.64] P:1735.36 E:0.107682 |  and Colasen actually wing backs, Terera and Jacque in the middle of the park, Mesut Ersel
[371.64 - 376.48] P:1807.66 E:0.099630 |  who's hardly had a touch if he has had a touch so far, he's the number ten position behind
[376.48 - 382.16] P:1872.19 E:0.108704 |  Lacazette and Obamayang, much made Alan of the potent nature of Arsenal's front three
[382.16 - 386.52] P:1774.32 E:0.097579 |  but they've got to get the ball first, we've played six minutes, those three have hardly
[386.68 - 390.40] P:1898.55 E:0.099217 |  had a touch, yeah you're two central midfield players and you in your centre backs need
[390.40 - 394.48] P:1773.53 E:0.101964 |  to be much better in possession than they've been, they've given the ball away and turned
[394.48 - 398.00] P:1876.12 E:0.104453 |  it over to Chelsea and they're starting to just get a little bit of a feel for it Chelsea
[398.00 - 405.04] P:1908.67 E:0.114936 |  I think, Azard has been on the ball as you'd expect in that little pocket, Fal committed
[405.04 - 410.64] P:1825.08 E:0.102426 |  by David Louise on Lacazette ten yards inside the Chelsea half for the first time Arsenal
[410.64 - 416.08] P:1755.61 E:0.099254 |  have a free kick inside the reported south that was trademark David Louise there, I
[416.64 - 421.64] P:1832.49 E:0.101868 |  mean no attempt really to play the ball, happily conceding the free kick just to let Lacazette
[421.64 - 426.92] P:1851.67 E:0.106473 |  know he's there, yeah and Obamayang had a feel from Christensen as well just making
[426.92 - 431.00] P:1723.67 E:0.100264 |  them half the centre backs as you'd expect, Mesut Ersel's only had one touch to the ball
[431.00 - 435.56] P:1746.98 E:0.100017 |  so far he's about to have his second to take the free kick left footed high towards the
[435.56 - 440.40] P:1919.10 E:0.103360 |  far side of the penalty area, Colasen was trying to creep in defending Olivier Giroud
[440.40 - 444.64] P:1958.16 E:0.101768 |  against his old team back pedals he was trying to put it out for a throw I think he's put
[444.72 - 448.16] P:1691.46 E:0.109831 |  it out for a corner or a throw and I thought the referee was indicating to the quarter
[448.16 - 454.32] P:1785.96 E:0.095101 |  flag it is a throw in right down in that location for Arsenal so their first proper attack
[454.32 - 458.88] P:1861.61 E:0.098949 |  of the game, terrible throw, Colasen at straight to Georgina and that's just giving away position
[458.88 - 463.40] P:1818.46 E:0.101154 |  Katte is beaten to it by Torera, Lacazette gets a chance, Jacque does well to keep it
[463.40 - 467.92] P:1788.78 E:0.100004 |  moving and Arsenal have a crossing position left hand side, Colasen at his attempted cross
[467.92 - 473.20] P:1932.06 E:0.107886 |  though cut out by Aspel at quite a Chelsea clear it away for a throw still nil nil on
[473.28 - 478.16] P:1721.00 E:0.100305 |  five live and BBC Radio London. Yeah I mean Katte looks like he's fine to me I mean I've
[478.16 - 482.16] P:1732.99 E:0.113406 |  watched him just that first sort of five six minutes there and he's moving well he looks
[482.16 - 486.64] P:1792.63 E:0.104202 |  fine so I don't think there's a much to worry about there I think in that period you would
[486.64 - 490.56] P:1823.23 E:0.092923 |  have seen something so that would be great news for the manager great news for Chelsea.
[490.56 - 497.68] P:1786.91 E:0.097782 |  This all English Europa League final, Colasen atch turns and rolls it back to Petticec for
[497.68 - 502.88] P:1696.06 E:0.099734 |  a long time ranked as the best goalkeeper in the world tonight playing as a professional
[503.28 - 508.08] P:1755.55 E:0.098941 |  for the final time. Arsenal come down the left Lacazette controls but immediately
[508.08 - 513.04] P:1820.42 E:0.100250 |  Georgina is in to win it off and that's Neaton Tidy from Georgina, Chelsea get it back,
[513.04 - 517.84] P:1768.49 E:0.103068 |  Davy Louise on the edge of the D of the penalty area that Chelsea defend and he just scoops it
[517.84 - 522.24] P:1745.82 E:0.094783 |  out to Emerson the left back who's put under pressure by Maitland Niles and Chelsea retreat to
[522.24 - 527.52] P:1671.80 E:0.104701 |  their goalkeeper caper and both teams still just feeling it to the right here as Chelsea try to play
[527.52 - 532.56] P:1706.05 E:0.101269 |  their way out of defense. Aspel acquitted, loops it forward and Golucante controls and he's up
[532.64 - 537.76] P:1850.34 E:0.100421 |  a thigh, shifts it on to Georgina up towards Olivier Giroud not a good enough ball cut out by
[537.76 - 543.84] P:1959.57 E:0.109396 |  Kishelny. Arsenal find a bit of space now for Maitland Niles down the right hand side, Obamian gets
[543.84 - 548.88] P:1920.76 E:0.110348 |  involved back to Maitland Niles crossing position to the ball and whipped in with power keeper Flokson
[548.88 - 555.68] P:1959.32 E:0.104192 |  follow-up shot by Obamian is left and wide it's the first real chance of the game it's taken eight
[555.68 - 561.36] P:1863.85 E:0.103934 |  minutes and Obamian didn't catch it as cleanly as he would have wished. Oh and Maitland Niles was
[561.36 - 566.40] P:1840.65 E:0.101087 |  you know he encouraged to join in their lead hazard which is nice to see he has that freedom to
[566.40 - 571.68] P:1803.58 E:0.090272 |  do that got down the right hand side good cross across the near post and Kepper made a bit of a
[571.68 - 576.40] P:1850.14 E:0.100080 |  hash of that he looked nervous he punched it out into the middle and then the shot from the striker
[576.40 - 581.76] P:1879.89 E:0.103330 |  GS wide good chance for Arsenal. It was not a floated cross from Maitland Niles it was drilled in
[582.32 - 588.56] P:1756.24 E:0.095125 |  a keeper struggled to deal with it and on another day Obamian might have done better with Kepper
[589.12 - 593.04] P:1779.13 E:0.110693 |  out of position somewhat the goal a little bit at his mercy there's an awkward hide again
[593.04 - 598.96] P:1823.75 E:0.093181 |  spinning at him but the player of the quality of Pierre-Emerick Obamian he might well have
[598.96 - 605.52] P:1777.22 E:0.093697 |  expected to hit the target there right free kick for Arsenal inside their own half taken by Kishelny
[605.52 - 610.56] P:1750.06 E:0.107529 |  short to the Uruguayan Lucas Torera coming to the end of his first season as an Arsenal player
[610.56 - 616.08] P:1760.20 E:0.114079 |  Maitland Niles finds himself immediately tackled by Emerson as the ball comes his way and that goes
[616.08 - 621.92] P:1803.22 E:0.113030 |  out for a throw into Arsenal right in front of Mauricio Sarri who we know that as he arrived
[621.92 - 627.44] P:1771.08 E:0.114912 |  was wearing a suit very smart to tell you it's a feeling I've ever seen Mauricio Sarri wear a suit
[627.44 - 631.76] P:1773.11 E:0.106825 |  he looked great but the game is underway and he's back and he's regular attire and he's got the
[631.76 - 637.68] P:1745.58 E:0.104587 |  floppy top and the tight tracky bottoms and the trainers and he's down there and arms folded
[637.68 - 643.60] P:1797.31 E:0.102184 |  across his chest and observing the opening stages of this Europa League final here in Baku
[643.68 - 650.48] P:1769.93 E:0.100754 |  in Azerbaijan where you can smell the petrol fumes in the air David Louise floats it forward right
[650.48 - 656.24] P:1820.85 E:0.092826 |  foot it towards Olivier Giroud gets it at the second attempt helped by Eden Azad gives it back
[656.24 - 661.12] P:1842.48 E:0.100877 |  to the Belgian lovely shift of weight from his left to his right there to create a bit of space by
[661.12 - 667.28] P:1824.33 E:0.099637 |  Azad and now Pedro's involved 15 yards outside the Arsenal peddle the area Azad's hungry here he
[667.28 - 672.24] P:1868.54 E:0.108149 |  runs into possession and receives it again twist one way then the other Arsenal defenders of Fates
[672.24 - 677.20] P:1920.21 E:0.114892 |  to Lugin now they do Azad goes down into the penalty area nothing doing with the referee
[677.20 - 681.76] P:1945.60 E:0.094725 |  who doesn't even give it a second look he was challenged outside the box he fell into the
[681.76 - 687.28] P:1850.40 E:0.107867 |  penalty area Eden Azad the referee was well located he said play on and Arsenal looked to
[687.28 - 691.12] P:1793.96 E:0.103782 |  clear it away here down the right hand side Alampardji what do you make of that well that was
[691.12 - 696.40] P:1893.28 E:0.102347 |  brilliant from Hazard he got it on this this left hand side done a little bit got it back into midfield
[696.40 - 701.04] P:1815.52 E:0.099524 |  and then went right across the other side of the pitch played a brilliant one too and then
[701.68 - 705.76] P:1781.96 E:0.101853 |  it was so difficult to see from here where he was actually caught or he took a dive
[705.76 - 711.28] P:1763.76 E:0.102197 |  just seeing the replay now looked to me like a foul so a little bit unlucky then Hazard he was a
[711.28 - 716.88] P:1777.00 E:0.104502 |  there's a great bit of play though the only only sort of play Hazard can do yeah you can see in that
[716.88 - 721.76] P:1861.19 E:0.107239 |  moment that he is up for this game he had an energy and enthusiasm he was involved three different
[721.76 - 727.36] P:1802.05 E:0.098386 |  times at three different locations and Arsenal might well off their hands full keeping tabs on
[727.44 - 732.56] P:1871.41 E:0.098219 |  Eden Azad tonight here comes Kovacic the Croatian who this time last year was getting ready to play
[732.56 - 736.40] P:1872.04 E:0.101732 |  in the World Cup but of course he got all the way to the final as well as the Frenchman and show
[736.40 - 741.52] P:1861.46 E:0.105842 |  him as it runs the ball out of play he's a look at it was trying to to dribble it along the chalk
[741.52 - 746.56] P:1821.29 E:0.093986 |  of the touch line but it does go out and that will be a throw into Chelsea just in front of
[746.56 - 754.00] P:1702.74 E:0.104577 |  Mauricio Sarri 12 minutes played Chelsea nil Arsenal nil in Baku yeah I mean now Zo is such an
[754.00 - 758.40] P:1799.65 E:0.116407 |  important role today it'd be great to see him on the ball because he has that you know like
[758.40 - 764.48] P:1780.45 E:0.111306 |  Hazard he's not quite the same in terms of taking players on but the way he passes the clinical style
[764.48 - 769.84] P:1923.65 E:0.108572 |  of his through pass it'd be great to see some moments from him and just then just showed a little flash
[770.56 - 776.24] P:1779.75 E:0.097853 |  this is the olympic stadium in Baku there is a running track around the pitch but they've
[776.24 - 782.08] P:1779.19 E:0.100031 |  covered it with a sort of a heavy green carpet and the two enormous Chelsea and Arsenal shirts
[782.16 - 787.92] P:1785.76 E:0.097935 |  that were displayed on the pitch as the teams came out they are now positioned behind the goal if
[787.92 - 792.96] P:1875.36 E:0.098991 |  you're sitting behind the goal you're quite a far away back from the action that the steepest and
[792.96 - 798.72] P:1831.53 E:0.098836 |  highest sides of this ground are along either edge of the pitch and at both ends there's three
[798.72 - 804.48] P:1769.76 E:0.103792 |  tiers there's actually six tiers on the far side from us including two tiers of corporate hospitality
[804.48 - 809.12] P:1840.70 E:0.096960 |  as Petticec clears straight down the middle of the pitch Obamian jumps doesn't get a clean touch on it
[809.20 - 815.84] P:1691.94 E:0.102986 |  Lackazette won't get there as Aspelikweta helps it back to Kaeper who's played in all but two of
[815.84 - 821.36] P:1734.01 E:0.100103 |  Chelsea's Premier League games this past season and all but two of their Europa League games
[821.36 - 827.04] P:1663.87 E:0.105846 |  on the way to this final as well Caviera was put in in that shenanigan after the the League Cup
[827.04 - 833.68] P:1746.56 E:0.105311 |  final of course here is David Louise 15 yards outside his own penalty area no great urgency
[833.68 - 838.40] P:1815.92 E:0.098449 |  impressed from Arsenal here until it comes to Aspelikweta then Kolasinac comes and powers into
[838.40 - 842.56] P:1830.99 E:0.098175 |  him but Chelsea weaved through that and then Koshelny does well to win it back in the midfield
[842.56 - 847.44] P:1824.41 E:0.099951 |  and here come Arsenal Lackazette receiving it looking up for Obamian that was good it was clever
[847.44 - 853.04] P:1905.16 E:0.100989 |  but he couldn't quite receive it Obamian and it skims through him and out for a Chelsea goal kick
[853.04 - 858.88] P:1831.84 E:0.107452 |  still 0-0 the nice contrast of styles there Chelsea almost worked a moment there to get through
[858.88 - 864.32] P:1770.43 E:0.104029 |  Arsenal's press but one they when he didn't quite come off Arsenal quick on the counter
[864.32 - 870.40] P:1737.63 E:0.102132 |  good turn from Lackazette and Obamian almost in almost Unai Emery hoping to become the fourth
[870.40 - 875.68] P:1808.54 E:0.098966 |  manager to win out of the old UEFA Cup or the current Europa League with two different teams
[875.68 - 881.04] P:1792.25 E:0.101457 |  Giovanni Trappatoni did it with Uve and Inter and Chelsea Mourinho did it with Porto and
[881.04 - 886.40] P:1805.48 E:0.102517 |  and Manchester United Rafa's done it with Valencia and Chelsea of course and Unai Emery
[886.40 - 890.64] P:1940.70 E:0.116632 |  hoping to join that through because down goes Olivier Giroux here just outside the Arsenal
[890.72 - 894.96] P:1942.05 E:0.105921 |  penalty area and he's managed to win a free kick and those cheers and whistles of the background
[894.96 - 901.12] P:1848.87 E:0.097788 |  coming from the Arsenal fans who felt that was a defile it was Laurent Koshelny who clattered into it
[902.32 - 907.60] P:1803.52 E:0.106309 |  well it's a great position for Chelsea I mean that's about three yards outside the 18-yard
[907.60 - 913.36] P:1780.54 E:0.103918 |  box so a great position for Hazard I could see him on the ball and got some big big targets in there
[913.36 - 919.76] P:1761.10 E:0.107744 |  with Louis and Giroux so big test here for Arsenal and particularly on Peter Check these are the
[919.76 - 926.88] P:1839.62 E:0.104702 |  moments that you'd like to test him early on Peter Check such a proud history and reputation
[926.88 - 932.24] P:1854.77 E:0.107370 |  of the game playing in his final match as a professional against his old club I would even
[932.24 - 938.24] P:1870.36 E:0.106930 |  hate to be involved in any sort of an error tonight as Hazard whips it in and it well what happened
[938.24 - 944.96] P:1926.14 E:0.104822 |  there there was a push in an Arsenal defender to Rara and absolutely no sweat at all to Arsenal
[944.96 - 949.68] P:1826.25 E:0.097418 |  they win themselves a free kick from what should have been a dangerous Chelsea position it immediately
[949.84 - 954.64] P:1747.20 E:0.105325 |  becomes a free kick for Arsenal a chance to clear away yeah I mean David Louise again yeah Louise
[954.64 - 959.60] P:1856.21 E:0.103920 |  just pushes to Rara over there and that's just ridiculous he does those kind of moments and
[959.60 - 965.36] P:1834.83 E:0.107179 |  so infuriating for Chelsea fans David Louise he dunked out of the header earlier he has these
[965.36 - 970.24] P:1860.18 E:0.109619 |  crazy moments but of course you know he comes with great quality in other areas he needs to
[970.24 - 975.20] P:1894.48 E:0.108448 |  just calm down a little yep you have to take the good with the bad of David Louise who's trying
[975.28 - 980.24] P:1813.15 E:0.105085 |  to play the hard man I think in the early stages here when he cladded into like a Zed and there when
[980.24 - 984.32] P:1792.49 E:0.105623 |  he bundled to rare out of the way but it's been wasteful for his team and now down the other
[984.32 - 989.76] P:1971.37 E:0.103658 |  end Arsenal are in Kolasinac first side good recovery by Aspelikweta and he puts it out for
[989.76 - 995.44] P:1950.82 E:0.100216 |  a corner just for a moment Arsenal look to have picked the lock there and Kolasinac inside the
[995.44 - 1001.20] P:1783.46 E:0.102865 |  penalty area it was really good defending by Aspelikweta to get back yeah Petro kind of
[1001.28 - 1008.40] P:1776.68 E:0.101293 |  squitched off there and as Aspelikweta really did well as he's done the Chelsea many many times
[1008.40 - 1014.08] P:1834.77 E:0.100173 |  brilliant defending corner for Arsenal here it comes from the far side and cleared to the edge
[1014.08 - 1018.56] P:1812.46 E:0.102423 |  of the penalty area where Maitland Niles was lurking he couldn't get it down couldn't get into
[1018.56 - 1022.96] P:1906.51 E:0.096819 |  a position to shoot but it's back out to Kolasinac on the left hand side it's Jack in factor
[1022.96 - 1028.00] P:1910.66 E:0.102443 |  sends in across and it's deflected back away again and that goes out for an Arsenal throw in down near
[1028.00 - 1033.20] P:1805.83 E:0.099496 |  the corner flag they attack on the left hand side this is 5-5 for the BBC we're also live tonight
[1033.20 - 1038.32] P:1776.97 E:0.101203 |  in London on BBC Radio London we're live in Baku 16 minutes on the big stadium clock
[1039.28 - 1045.12] P:1707.97 E:0.101433 |  Chelsea Niles Arsenal nail the score Arsenal on the attack as the throw in is given to Montréal
[1045.68 - 1049.52] P:1726.03 E:0.098119 |  he sends it straight back to the half along with most of his teammates ahead of it
[1049.52 - 1053.76] P:1809.17 E:0.107993 |  and that what a waste that is as Koshelny puts it out of play what do you make of that Alan
[1054.72 - 1058.72] P:1793.05 E:0.101348 |  it wasn't his greatest pass but a good spell for Arsenal that was probably their best spell
[1058.72 - 1064.32] P:1754.99 E:0.109551 |  of the game so far it's nice and evenly poised at the moment the wingbacks have got in a couple
[1064.32 - 1069.60] P:1751.35 E:0.103991 |  of times for Arsenal down the sides and they've probably been the two best chances and you know
[1069.60 - 1075.12] P:1791.51 E:0.105844 |  an early cross down this right hand side and this left hand side as well so Chelsea just
[1075.12 - 1079.52] P:1843.62 E:0.097158 |  needs to be aware that central midfield players of the wingbacks getting in because the two wide
[1079.60 - 1085.60] P:1802.03 E:0.096498 |  players are hazard and Pedro they're just letting them go Nile Nile this stadium which will be used
[1085.60 - 1092.72] P:1852.67 E:0.101709 |  for games at Euro 2020 next summer that's a good header by Obamian Cape has got to come out
[1092.72 - 1099.28] P:1986.96 E:0.112129 |  challenges like a set also what a penalty referee is waiting and hesitating and I think he wants to
[1099.28 - 1105.36] P:1915.51 E:0.107959 |  hear what VA or have got to say about this lack of set went charging into the penalty area Cape
[1105.36 - 1111.12] P:1882.65 E:0.108942 |  came out and the referee for the moment is indicating that it's a gold kick I think he's
[1111.12 - 1116.32] P:1943.81 E:0.108560 |  indicating in the most tame way possible I think lack of set gets there first and then he's fouled
[1116.32 - 1123.12] P:1953.93 E:0.112409 |  by the goalkeeper the VA or officials are checking to see if it's a penalty I think they've got a
[1123.12 - 1130.72] P:1923.58 E:0.099839 |  strong case here but we've just been told the check is over they say no penalty well he wins it first
[1131.36 - 1135.84] P:1837.61 E:0.099216 |  the keeper actually catches him is probably debatable on what I've just seen on that replay
[1135.84 - 1141.04] P:1843.12 E:0.104945 |  but he definitely got there first and then he went over so wherever the dive was out was in no
[1141.04 - 1144.96] P:1917.28 E:0.104057 |  contact and he just dived after because he wasn't going to get it because I think it was running out
[1144.96 - 1152.16] P:1778.57 E:0.103774 |  of play so we'll have to see that again well very close it is further evidence that they are warming
[1152.16 - 1157.28] P:1783.74 E:0.100272 |  up Arsenal they're beginning to get in around the Chelsea defense Obamian's pass there was really
[1157.36 - 1162.56] P:1809.03 E:0.097663 |  good lack of set we know he's got the pace in the race head to head against
[1162.56 - 1168.32] P:1880.84 E:0.104022 |  Cape are running out towards me against the touch first down he goes but the VA or officials
[1168.32 - 1174.08] P:1794.86 E:0.100404 |  have decided that there was no foul by the goalkeeper and no resultant penalty but it's a
[1174.08 - 1178.96] P:1844.25 E:0.101348 |  scare a big scare for Chelsea wasn't that interesting with the referee didn't look like he
[1178.96 - 1183.20] P:1835.15 E:0.107234 |  made a decision at all it looked like he was I didn't even think he'd give a gold kick he was
[1183.28 - 1187.28] P:1848.17 E:0.101416 |  just hovering waiting for bar that is the problem when you have that system
[1188.16 - 1193.60] P:1892.43 E:0.105188 |  little nil in the Europa League final lack of set collects possession near the halfway line
[1193.60 - 1199.20] P:1893.48 E:0.105765 |  challenge this done by Andreas Christensen another foul given away by the Chelsea defense
[1199.20 - 1206.40] P:1773.61 E:0.105155 |  free kick to Arsenal on the halfway line Christian Sun who only played in eight Premier League games
[1206.40 - 1210.88] P:1752.12 E:0.106767 |  this campaign just finished has been a regular in this competition though in the Europa League
[1211.52 - 1215.92] P:1790.24 E:0.108912 |  and he falls back into a defensive position now as Chelsea pulled everyone apart from
[1215.92 - 1221.52] P:1791.86 E:0.098961 |  Sheree back behind the ball and I still take the free kick short to Shelley good ball
[1221.52 - 1226.80] P:1735.77 E:0.103657 |  into Mesut Erz and right channel the midfield midway inside the Chelsea half Maitland Niles is
[1226.80 - 1231.52] P:1866.91 E:0.107341 |  with him in support takes on Emerson goes around it Maitland Niles scoffed the cross a little bit
[1231.52 - 1237.04] P:1964.04 E:0.109214 |  but put out out off to a junior for a quarter quarter to Arsenal on the right hand side
[1237.68 - 1242.80] P:1847.88 E:0.106876 |  good spell from Arsenal and you know the use nice ball out from the back from Chris Chelney
[1242.80 - 1246.32] P:1693.85 E:0.112946 |  into the midfield and then the wing back got in again and that's the second time
[1246.32 - 1251.92] P:1765.64 E:0.112029 |  Maitland Niles he just won past Emerson and they've got a corner in a good position and a great spell
[1252.80 - 1259.60] P:1787.96 E:0.098215 |  nil nil the score line remains possession slightly in Chelsea's favour overall but
[1259.60 - 1265.28] P:1809.23 E:0.098711 |  Arsenal looking the more dangerous at the moment as Grannichakor comes across and he just picks
[1265.28 - 1269.12] P:1800.86 E:0.100940 |  something off the pitch there I don't know what it was he picks something as he was placing the
[1269.12 - 1274.00] P:1865.20 E:0.102417 |  ball here comes left foot across played in David Louise with a header away that was important
[1274.00 - 1278.72] P:1831.28 E:0.101455 |  and Aidan Azad continues that clearance on the edge of the penalty area good quarter by Shaka
[1278.72 - 1284.24] P:1832.94 E:0.103494 |  well dealt with by David Louise Terera has the centre circle to himself sprays out a lovely ball
[1284.24 - 1289.12] P:1880.44 E:0.110142 |  to Mesut Erzal who's picked up a position on the left wing support inside from Kolasinac driving
[1289.12 - 1295.68] P:1879.18 E:0.107072 |  but the offside flag is raised and that must have been for Erzal as the ball was played he was offside
[1296.32 - 1301.36] P:1765.26 E:0.107650 |  yeah just getting exploited Chelsea a little bit down the sides but a great header from Lewis
[1301.36 - 1306.48] P:1754.87 E:0.099953 |  from that corner because that was right where you want it if you're an attacking team right just
[1306.48 - 1310.88] P:1752.66 E:0.108433 |  inside that six yard box and it was a good defensive header one of these better moments
[1310.88 - 1317.28] P:1712.35 E:0.108932 |  in this game so far Chelsea playing in the Europa League for only the second time last
[1317.28 - 1323.20] P:1755.36 E:0.106108 |  time they played in this competition they won it that was in 2013 Sheru here wins a header
[1323.20 - 1327.44] P:1772.35 E:0.110277 |  and he was trying to cushion it down for Azad but he put too much on it and it goes out for
[1327.44 - 1333.28] P:1796.70 E:0.106985 |  an Arsenal throw Olivier Sheru who's not really been in the game so far certainly not in an
[1333.28 - 1338.24] P:1734.07 E:0.104390 |  attacking sense and Chelsea need to work out how they can get them out of us have been the joint
[1338.24 - 1342.96] P:1771.06 E:0.100095 |  top scorer in this competition so far how they can get him involved so far and maybe a chance
[1342.96 - 1348.40] P:1821.91 E:0.094963 |  to claim that top spot all to himself Jovic the Eintracht Frankfurt player is the other
[1348.40 - 1353.28] P:1939.88 E:0.113558 |  who's level with him here come Arsenal again like I said trying to surge forward good goalkeeping
[1353.28 - 1358.16] P:1882.63 E:0.104704 |  brave goalkeeping keeper Rietha Balaga came out I think he bundled into his team at Aspelicueta
[1358.16 - 1365.60] P:1809.77 E:0.098044 |  there and the goalkeeper is hurt Aspelicueta is down Rietha Balaga is down both Spaniards
[1365.60 - 1370.08] P:1826.90 E:0.103955 |  are going to be in need of some treatment here and again Arsenal getting in around the back of
[1370.08 - 1374.16] P:1851.93 E:0.107120 |  that Chelsea defense at the barge it's just the pace of the front too they're just causing them
[1374.16 - 1380.32] P:1852.13 E:0.112016 |  problems and he almost got that under control Lacazette and if he had you'd like to think he
[1380.32 - 1385.52] P:1853.04 E:0.110905 |  had scored there big collision between the goal in Aspelicueta but he's okay he'll be alright to
[1385.52 - 1390.08] P:1799.94 E:0.106459 |  continue so we're off from ready pulling his shirt by the way on the way through there certainly was
[1390.08 - 1395.44] P:1799.59 E:0.104772 |  yeah Aspelicueta was using all the dark arts of defending to try and keep Lacazette from
[1396.00 - 1400.24] P:1764.91 E:0.107141 |  from burning him with the the pace there as they both charged into the penalty area
[1401.20 - 1408.16] P:1731.28 E:0.101983 |  play is going to resume with a free kick to Chelsea just inside their penalty area taken by
[1408.16 - 1413.60] P:1768.50 E:0.106406 |  Kaeper and out towards Emerson who's immediately challenged by Maitland Niles and I think a feature
[1413.60 - 1418.24] P:1894.46 E:0.104429 |  that gave so far is that with the two Chelsea central defenders Christensen and Louise Havett
[1418.24 - 1423.12] P:1827.14 E:0.099251 |  there's no big press for Obamie Ang and Lacazette but as soon as the full backs get it Aspelicueta
[1423.20 - 1429.44] P:1836.90 E:0.101592 |  Emerson then the press comes Kalasenac and Maitland Niles putting pressure on those two so far
[1429.44 - 1436.48] P:1865.94 E:0.111085 |  in Golokante heavy pass very heavy too far in front of Aspelicueta goes out for an Arsenal throw
[1436.48 - 1440.80] P:1833.89 E:0.098171 |  and what should have been a routine clearance for Chelsea has now given Arsenal an attacking
[1440.80 - 1446.00] P:1734.61 E:0.110439 |  platform yeah I mean Arsenal are far the better side in this last 10 minutes and you're quite right
[1446.00 - 1451.20] P:1747.40 E:0.108516 |  and Maitland Niles down this side has been terrific just in this spell and he's causing a problem
[1451.28 - 1456.48] P:1810.53 E:0.110018 |  because Hazard's not tracking him so he's got the freedom and all credit to the manager to
[1456.48 - 1462.08] P:1876.07 E:0.116857 |  give him that freedom to let him go and run on. Here comes Monreal good bursting Rondamba left
[1462.08 - 1467.60] P:1850.22 E:0.104033 |  hand side and then fouled by Pedro and Chelsea are making a lot of fouls at the moment and I think
[1467.60 - 1473.52] P:1768.16 E:0.103345 |  it's testament to the pressure that Arsenal are putting on the Monreal just about to skip away
[1473.52 - 1479.84] P:1748.67 E:0.103908 |  from his compatriot and Pedro made sure he would go no further so a tactical fouling from Chelsea
[1479.84 - 1485.84] P:1774.56 E:0.106829 |  the spreading it around so no one individual looks at the guilty party so free kick to Arsenal
[1485.84 - 1491.04] P:1715.18 E:0.102154 |  they'll send plenty of bodies forward here Chelsea have got everyone back in around their penalty
[1491.04 - 1497.36] P:1821.01 E:0.101950 |  area they're holding a high line as well on the edge of the box good distribution here from
[1497.36 - 1502.56] P:1742.06 E:0.102050 |  Jaka and they could get into that corridor of uncertainty between the defenders and the goalkeeper
[1502.56 - 1506.56] P:1789.14 E:0.107732 |  the Swiss international stands and waits for the signal from the Italian referee there's the
[1506.56 - 1511.20] P:1857.35 E:0.102648 |  whistle here it comes in for Granicakha Kishelny missed it out comes Kaeper I think the last
[1511.20 - 1517.04] P:1993.36 E:0.105634 |  touch there off Socrates but it hit him rather than the other way around no shot at the end of it
[1517.04 - 1522.32] P:1771.31 E:0.094155 |  from Arsenal and their best chance so far remains that effort from Obamie Yang earlier on after
[1522.32 - 1527.36] P:1829.16 E:0.099009 |  Kaeper had punched it away into his path. Yeah it was just a bit shallow that free kick wanting to be
[1527.36 - 1531.36] P:1682.00 E:0.105679 |  just a little bit more on the back of that Chelsea line it was very very high and
[1532.08 - 1535.92] P:1767.13 E:0.105983 |  their Arsenal players ready to go but another chance for Arsenal you know the
[1535.92 - 1541.20] P:1721.16 E:0.101584 |  the creating chances they're making Chelsea play in their own half and turnovers
[1543.52 - 1548.40] P:1813.43 E:0.113148 |  Chelsea working hard in the midfield here Pedro wins possession that really got the way he skipped
[1548.40 - 1554.40] P:1966.91 E:0.112663 |  away from Lucas Terera now this is a test of a Golucatis fitness he runs he gets it into Olivier
[1554.40 - 1560.24] P:1894.03 E:0.109934 |  Chiroux tangled up in his feet he tried to pull it down with the instep of his left boot it hit his
[1560.24 - 1565.60] P:1898.43 E:0.105721 |  right boot he still nearly managed to get it under his control but for the first time in the game
[1565.60 - 1571.20] P:1865.53 E:0.091746 |  and it has taken 25 minutes for this to happen a counter attack from Chelsea and across that very
[1571.20 - 1575.52] P:1733.47 E:0.101858 |  nearly found Olivier Chiroux yeah and the centre backs were pulled around there once you do that
[1575.52 - 1580.00] P:1849.33 E:0.098709 |  when you commit to that press as Arsenal did then and a centre half's gone in then you're only one
[1580.00 - 1584.56] P:1757.54 E:0.104136 |  b1 in the middle where you're centre back and Chiroux jesting I'm not sure if he was trying to
[1584.56 - 1589.12] P:1740.67 E:0.096432 |  bring Pedro into the game there with a sort of clever backflip he had done better to get it under
[1589.12 - 1596.88] P:1838.53 E:0.088112 |  control but a good chance for Chelsea possession down the other end with the Chelsea goalkeeper
[1597.60 - 1603.68] P:1820.05 E:0.098047 |  the gap is clearance up towards the halfway line returns possession to Arsenal Chelsea Ndell
[1603.68 - 1611.12] P:1818.25 E:0.095072 |  Arsenal Niel here in Azerbaijan as the ball goes out of play off the knee of Matlin Niles
[1611.12 - 1614.80] P:1761.00 E:0.094312 |  and that returns possession back to Chelsea they take the throw in quickly Lucas Terera
[1614.80 - 1621.20] P:1851.57 E:0.106191 |  puts pressure on Kovacic it's a foul but play on to the referee oh and again in Golokate with a
[1621.20 - 1626.48] P:1845.38 E:0.104451 |  wayward pass whatever he had in his mind in reality there was no one over there he lashed it out to
[1626.48 - 1632.24] P:1720.57 E:0.090971 |  the far wing and the ball goes straight out of play for an Arsenal throw and they get on with it
[1632.24 - 1639.20] P:1789.89 E:0.095811 |  into Kishelny 15 yards outside his own penalty area short to Matlin Niles now a long ball which
[1639.20 - 1643.76] P:1854.87 E:0.099510 |  Obamie Angle capped her after down the right wing he picks it up he's got support as well
[1643.76 - 1647.92] P:1879.18 E:0.103665 |  Colasinac to the far post and he can pick him out here it is played in Lacazette flicks it up into
[1647.92 - 1653.12] P:1829.29 E:0.099662 |  the air and Chelsea breathe a sigh of relief as it comes down for Giorgio and a chance to clear away
[1653.12 - 1657.52] P:1859.99 E:0.100866 |  well if Obamie Angle had spotted Colasinac there he had an acre to himself on the far side here
[1657.52 - 1662.00] P:1827.29 E:0.106743 |  comes Lucas Terera trying to dribble his way into the penalty area too many blue shirted defenders
[1662.00 - 1667.84] P:1863.27 E:0.099784 |  in the way and Chelsea are able to get it away but only as far as Mesut Erzel just outside the
[1667.84 - 1674.16] P:1849.86 E:0.103789 |  Chelsea penalty area gives it out to Colasinac now back into Gradijakka be urged to shoot he does
[1674.16 - 1680.24] P:1919.10 E:0.112722 |  shoot and it's just over the top and the biggest ooo of the night from the crowd in Baku as the
[1680.24 - 1687.60] P:1921.31 E:0.106493 |  shot from Gradijakka is not that far over the top at all well the Arsenal causing Chelsea all sorts
[1687.60 - 1692.08] P:1734.77 E:0.092184 |  of problems particularly the front two they're running down the sides at a centre backs they got
[1692.08 - 1698.64] P:1784.49 E:0.092846 |  in again there great cross and it got cleared and then it come out and Jaby has a great hit
[1698.64 - 1705.60] P:1794.24 E:0.103670 |  I mean that is literally an inches over the bar fantastic hit which he he does possess and
[1705.60 - 1711.44] P:1814.70 E:0.102616 |  Chelsea just giving too much time there fantastic on the replay even clipped the bar at the end
[1711.44 - 1715.68] P:1786.53 E:0.107497 |  four goals from the Premier League this season for Gradijakka he scored for Switzerland
[1715.68 - 1721.52] P:1749.12 E:0.101699 |  during the international break in March as well against Denmark we know he can hit them from long
[1721.52 - 1727.76] P:1785.81 E:0.104737 |  range that's the first attempt he's had tonight but 28 minutes play Chelsea 0 Arsenal 0 here in Baku
[1727.76 - 1733.52] P:1869.52 E:0.106018 |  as Maitland Niles from a halfway line plays it over into space Colasinac sprints after it won't get
[1733.52 - 1740.48] P:1855.05 E:0.098711 |  their ball frustratingly for him bounces away and out for a throw into Chelsea Chelsea have absorbed
[1740.48 - 1745.36] P:1755.72 E:0.102885 |  a lot of pressure over the last 10 minutes or so yeah Chelsea Arsenal system is just dictating at
[1745.36 - 1750.16] P:1745.93 E:0.107241 |  the moment when you when you come out against these type of systems when you play free at the back
[1750.24 - 1755.12] P:1712.92 E:0.104220 |  you either dictate or you don't and they're dictating at the moment and that's great for the manager
[1755.12 - 1761.04] P:1876.58 E:0.113563 |  for sorry you'd be thinking hmm what's the way out now Chelsea's what I come on the counter attack
[1761.04 - 1767.52] P:1915.60 E:0.107750 |  here at Kova chat should push the ball ahead of him and try to chase after it Arsenal deal with
[1767.52 - 1771.92] P:1878.13 E:0.110263 |  it okay but Petticex clearance isn't great Eden Azar picks up possession here this room for
[1771.92 - 1777.04] P:1959.58 E:0.113856 |  Emerson in the penalty area shoots low blocked away by Stratas and it goes out for a quarter to
[1777.04 - 1782.96] P:1979.52 E:0.106794 |  Chelsea and his final is warming up and we're beginning to have chances at both ends yeah
[1782.96 - 1788.48] P:1856.61 E:0.108912 |  they just got they just got disheveled they are asked all sometimes they just got too many men
[1788.48 - 1792.56] P:1866.60 E:0.109492 |  going to the ball they got lost their shape and there was a chance there for Emerson the left
[1792.56 - 1797.60] P:1884.25 E:0.112343 |  back position worked nice to cut out by the centre back it's a corner one call for Chelsea at the
[1797.60 - 1803.12] P:1810.58 E:0.112392 |  pass for Emerson in the lead cup and he shot blocked out for this corner which is about to be
[1803.12 - 1810.16] P:1878.16 E:0.105212 |  taken by Eden Azar and he's got a very busy penalty area awaiting Giroud he's been man marked
[1810.16 - 1814.72] P:1830.95 E:0.102288 |  at the far side by Stratas and those two are squaring up to each other so much so that the
[1814.72 - 1819.12] P:1831.21 E:0.100708 |  Italian referee has to come over and have a word and say he's got his eyes on them here comes the
[1819.12 - 1823.36] P:1857.28 E:0.103014 |  corner played in by Azar David Louise tries to get the other front post good defending to get it
[1823.36 - 1827.20] P:1824.84 E:0.104900 |  away I think was Monreal who cleared Arsenal off into step up but they don't all step out together
[1827.20 - 1831.28] P:1890.96 E:0.099195 |  and they're quite fortunate Mesut Ozil had his wits about him to head it away there Chelsea
[1831.36 - 1836.32] P:1913.73 E:0.107195 |  Trio want to edge the penalty area it's played in by Azar the return pass though from Covichet
[1836.32 - 1842.48] P:1754.98 E:0.101810 |  is too firm and it goes out for a goal kick to Chelsea and to Pedecek away to our left hand side
[1842.48 - 1849.60] P:1771.49 E:0.099507 |  Chelsea nil Arsenal nil here in the Europa League final at the start of a very busy week on five
[1849.60 - 1854.24] P:1812.95 E:0.102758 |  live we have so much coming up tomorrow the start of the cricket world cup England against South
[1854.24 - 1859.68] P:1825.30 E:0.097877 |  Africa the oval every ball of every match live across the tournament on Friday will be live in
[1859.68 - 1864.96] P:1778.49 E:0.095843 |  Madrid will be counting down to Saturday's commentary of the Champions League final again in
[1864.96 - 1869.36] P:1828.38 E:0.100918 |  all English affair Liverpool against Tottenham and then in the early hours of Sunday morning you can
[1869.36 - 1874.96] P:1874.92 E:0.102619 |  hear exclusive commentary from New York of Anthony Joshua against Andy Ruiz for the heavyweight
[1874.96 - 1880.72] P:1890.03 E:0.095294 |  championship of the world so much live sport and big live sport coming up over the next few days
[1880.72 - 1885.28] P:1719.81 E:0.104579 |  on five live and one way or the other tonight we're going to get an English team winning the
[1885.28 - 1890.08] P:1852.28 E:0.108879 |  Europa League tonight in Baku for the moment nothing to choose between Chelsea and Arsenal
[1890.08 - 1894.48] P:1869.87 E:0.102954 |  on the scoreboard Emerson comes down the left hand side Chelsea have absorbed a lot of pressure
[1894.48 - 1899.36] P:1814.04 E:0.101292 |  but now they're beginning to apply some in Golokante midway inside the Arsenal half to the right
[1899.36 - 1903.44] P:1875.42 E:0.100684 |  hand side to his captain that's what they're going to step off it the right back shoots deflected
[1903.44 - 1908.40] P:1847.65 E:0.106081 |  off the heels of the defender I think it was Socrates and Arsenal were able to clear the ball
[1908.40 - 1913.76] P:1838.52 E:0.099332 |  away and then Chelsea fighting better for it in the midfield ensure that Arsenal don't fully get it
[1913.76 - 1918.88] P:1758.63 E:0.095371 |  away it goes out for a throw in for them on the far side I mean it's that you know you can't be more
[1918.88 - 1923.52] P:1701.81 E:0.099896 |  balanced this final at the moment you know the two systems have got their different strengths
[1923.52 - 1928.48] P:1833.69 E:0.112322 |  and Arsenal probably just got shading it at a moment but a chance for Arsenal there here comes
[1928.48 - 1932.72] P:1822.78 E:0.106083 |  Lacazette bit of room for him down the right hand side Emerson's trying to get close that's a clever
[1932.72 - 1938.32] P:1862.84 E:0.107912 |  ball back to the end of the penalty area Mizzard Erzel to Terera over into space for Colas and
[1938.32 - 1942.88] P:1865.05 E:0.107810 |  I shot the first time today he's had space in that wing and he's attempted cross come shot gets
[1942.88 - 1947.12] P:1942.22 E:0.109920 |  deflected out for a corner and the game has become end to end in the last five minutes
[1947.76 - 1954.00] P:1713.06 E:0.116031 |  it is it's a really good game I mean there's no it's apart from Cante probably you know not training
[1954.00 - 1958.72] P:1678.03 E:0.105529 |  I don't know for a week or so definitely having its effects tonight he looks a bit rusty he's
[1958.72 - 1963.76] P:1736.18 E:0.098964 |  given more away other than that everybody's on the game the thing we haven't mentioned so far is
[1963.76 - 1968.72] P:1786.87 E:0.100015 |  that for both European finals this week here tonight and in Madrid on Saturday they're doing it like
[1968.80 - 1975.04] P:1836.11 E:0.098654 |  the World Cup where you can name a 23 man squad it's not just the seven subs you would normally get
[1975.04 - 1979.04] P:1877.57 E:0.106418 |  in the Europa League or a Champions League game so there's an enormous number of players available
[1979.04 - 1984.24] P:1906.78 E:0.102735 |  on both benches here's the Arsenal quarter played in by Gratajakas so Kratus's header goes wide to
[1984.24 - 1990.08] P:1864.19 E:0.098900 |  the far post that wasn't the best marking from Chelsea so Kratus was given quite a bit of room
[1990.96 - 1997.04] P:1805.15 E:0.101002 |  but it goes wide yeah but he was just just did enough really bit of pressure from christiansen
[1997.04 - 2001.20] P:1787.05 E:0.108801 |  who's just enough to put him off if he hadn't put that pressure on him with about a chance there but
[2001.84 - 2007.20] P:1724.00 E:0.113092 |  again a number corner from Arsenal and progressing down these sides must be worrying for Sarri that
[2007.20 - 2013.44] P:1810.58 E:0.101352 |  Arsenal keep getting in down his sides of his team last on these sides met Chelsea lost that was two
[2013.44 - 2020.08] P:1846.78 E:0.103334 |  days on the Premier League in January Chelsea haven't lost back-to-back games against Arsenal since 2011
[2020.08 - 2026.72] P:1747.87 E:0.098764 |  0-0 for now five live and BBC Radio London I'm sure many black cap drivers in the capital will be
[2026.72 - 2031.84] P:1816.39 E:0.105025 |  tuning in on one of those networks to us they may well know this but if you're a black cab driver
[2031.84 - 2036.40] P:1767.64 E:0.103894 |  in London you've got work in Azerbaijan if you ever wanted all the taxis over here are
[2036.40 - 2042.08] P:1804.97 E:0.101143 |  a London black cab taxis with one crucial difference Adam we know is the air condition is really good
[2043.36 - 2051.28] P:1828.15 E:0.096683 |  it needs to be given the heat here in Baku here come Chelsea Emerson into Giuggino that definitely
[2051.28 - 2056.56] P:1930.05 E:0.111054 |  played better now Chelsea here's Emerson gets to the end of the 1-2 shoot save by Pena Cek first
[2056.56 - 2062.48] P:1897.35 E:0.104722 |  important save of the man tipped to be Chelsea sporting director makes against Chelsea tonight
[2062.48 - 2068.16] P:1921.23 E:0.107976 |  as Azar tries to weave his way into the penalty area and is expertly dealt with by Ainsley Matlin
[2068.16 - 2073.52] P:1873.79 E:0.103019 |  as what a tackle that was to win the ball from Azar and to clear it away but then Incoli Cante
[2073.52 - 2080.56] P:1891.11 E:0.103049 |  catches um Galassana possession Incoli Cante's cross is weak and Arsenal managed to get it away
[2081.28 - 2086.56] P:1876.15 E:0.104609 |  but there's no doubt that this game has shifted up a gear or two with 12 minutes to go to half time
[2086.56 - 2091.84] P:1909.32 E:0.115897 |  Giuggino on the middle of the park gives it to Kovacic the noise here is good at the moment
[2092.48 - 2099.04] P:1921.54 E:0.112661 |  Emerson 10 yards outside the Arsenal penalty area to Eden Azar three Arsenal players come to
[2099.04 - 2104.80] P:1959.88 E:0.104503 |  surround him it's back to Kovacic nice flick by Olivier Giroud he does pick out Azar but Azar
[2104.80 - 2109.84] P:1913.40 E:0.101203 |  can't break away from the attentions of Socrates in front of him in the penalty area clever back

[2115.60 - 2120.56] P:1834.17 E:0.099614 |  he couldn't flick his heel back behind him the player who uh not so like he scored that wonderful
[2121.28 - 2125.60] P:1822.82 E:0.099104 |  what's it called scorpion kicks not so long ago Olivier Giroud it was that it just wasn't high enough
[2125.60 - 2129.52] P:1710.16 E:0.097258 |  for that kind of a flick but he was trying to propel it from behind and all he could do was play
[2129.52 - 2135.04] P:1778.90 E:0.097160 |  it back to Pena Cek 34 minutes of the clock Chelsea and Arsenal now yeah I mean Hazard just
[2135.04 - 2139.28] P:1778.59 E:0.101451 |  had a few more moments there and for Chelsea that's if you can just get him in possession
[2139.28 - 2144.08] P:1779.41 E:0.100623 |  you can see he's scaring Arsenal to death but he just hasn't seen enough of it Arsenal dictated
[2144.08 - 2148.80] P:1823.51 E:0.105207 |  most of the game and that's how they want to continue just keep limiting his possession when
[2148.80 - 2153.92] P:1839.17 E:0.106057 |  he gets it he's a threat but Arsenal are throw him well nice from his result to go around Eden
[2153.92 - 2159.12] P:1787.29 E:0.098522 |  Azar and he wanted to play a one two with Obama Yang with a return pass was too firm Emerson does
[2159.12 - 2164.40] P:1891.98 E:0.104764 |  well under pressure from from Ozil both Ozil and Azar that the flair players if you like they're
[2164.40 - 2168.72] P:1862.03 E:0.104051 |  working hard they're telling me it's got that final atmosphere where nobody's putting in a
[2168.72 - 2173.20] P:1823.14 E:0.095701 |  out shift here uh they're making themselves available they're hungry to be on the ball as
[2173.20 - 2176.88] P:1779.76 E:0.100388 |  Torera has possession near the halfway line Arsenal playing from left to right as we looked
[2176.88 - 2182.08] P:1796.57 E:0.093992 |  out in there red shirts white shorts red socks and I amery on the edge of the technical area
[2182.08 - 2186.88] P:1829.54 E:0.102553 |  smart in the suit but it's your sorry a bit scruffier in the track he to his right hand side
[2186.88 - 2191.12] P:1799.33 E:0.105126 |  enormous technical areas here on what would normally be the running track of this Olympic
[2191.12 - 2198.08] P:1798.65 E:0.093488 |  stadium nil nil the score 10 minutes to halftime Arsenal in possession granted Jack 15 yards inside
[2198.08 - 2203.76] P:1732.65 E:0.100170 |  the Chelsea half support alongside him from Socrates who started more Europa League games this
[2203.76 - 2210.40] P:1687.97 E:0.098770 |  season than any other Arsenal player this is Lacazette back to goal on the edge of the penalty
[2210.40 - 2215.68] P:1865.99 E:0.104872 |  area to Ozil into granted Jack again the space for Kolasin as well as like close enough here comes
[2215.68 - 2220.56] P:1882.63 E:0.105924 |  the cross and Kepp is able to punch it away and it comes back into the penalty area and Gigno
[2220.56 - 2226.16] P:1830.89 E:0.099577 |  completes the clearance and then a showboating back heel volley from Eden Azar does nearly pick up
[2226.16 - 2231.92] P:1878.62 E:0.097936 |  Olivier Giroud mind you but Giselle he gets there first and it's cleared away but just for a moment
[2231.92 - 2237.20] P:1772.34 E:0.094173 |  Arsenal thought again space for Kolasin I mean just to explain it for Listerus at home Alan
[2237.20 - 2241.68] P:1752.97 E:0.103442 |  Aspen Aquinas been really well in the game but he's leaving gaps for Kolasin actually
[2241.68 - 2246.80] P:1727.71 E:0.102206 |  was coming on that overlap his wing back and finding space in the penalty area you know Pedro
[2246.80 - 2252.48] P:1722.70 E:0.102508 |  has to do more for me I mean Pedro is you know at the moment thinking he's not his job but I think
[2252.48 - 2256.88] P:1777.68 E:0.105626 |  halftime he's going to get a severe reminder of his manager because this is the massive problem
[2256.88 - 2261.28] P:1756.34 E:0.096859 |  that they're getting both wire players are not tracking the wing backs and so Chelsea are completely
[2261.28 - 2265.92] P:1754.54 E:0.099168 |  overloaded and that is causing them the most problems today if you're just joining our coverage
[2265.92 - 2271.36] P:1797.69 E:0.102359 |  on five live we have had a penalty appeal for Arsenal Lacazette went down VA or looked at it and
[2271.36 - 2276.48] P:1773.14 E:0.102889 |  said no penalty tonight the first time video assistant referee has ever been used in the Europa
[2276.56 - 2281.20] P:1818.71 E:0.102736 |  League and we've also had a shot from Obama Yang after Keppa punched it out towards him and he
[2281.20 - 2285.84] P:1800.39 E:0.093983 |  didn't quite catch it cleanly down the other end across from Gulloch and he picked out Olivier
[2285.84 - 2290.48] P:1867.09 E:0.097928 |  Giroud but he got it in a tangle between his legs and the only other real chance was was
[2290.48 - 2298.40] P:1769.14 E:0.093680 |  Everson's shot which was saved by Petr Cech time ticks on halftime looming in Baku good play by
[2298.40 - 2303.68] P:1873.33 E:0.095154 |  Chelsea as they work their way over the halfway line as on gives it back to Georgina Arsenal
[2303.76 - 2308.48] P:1850.91 E:0.105572 |  now working hard to get back into defensive positions as Aspelik-Quetta comes over the
[2308.48 - 2313.84] P:1921.19 E:0.104862 |  halfway line supporters of Chelsea find their voices Petros Kost into the penalty area manages
[2313.84 - 2318.96] P:1882.84 E:0.099045 |  to pick out Azard but his first touch was just a little bit off and he couldn't get it under his
[2318.96 - 2325.12] P:1840.95 E:0.094973 |  spell and Socrates clears away for Arsenal good clearance up to Lacazette who's foul and again
[2325.12 - 2331.04] P:1893.69 E:0.099016 |  this pattern of Chelsea when they feel they might be outnumbered they commit fouls in neutral areas
[2331.12 - 2335.84] P:1711.15 E:0.099122 |  it's no card but it's a telling off from the referee and a free kick to Arsenal still 0-0
[2335.84 - 2340.08] P:1656.14 E:0.102353 |  Alan Bargeron. The best what Lacazette brings to the game you know is clever hold up play
[2340.08 - 2345.76] P:1682.80 E:0.093309 |  wait for the centre back to get too tight and then just took the ball in and drew the fouls clever
[2345.76 - 2350.72] P:1775.29 E:0.099135 |  centre forward play there but you know this is a nicely balanced game and in some respects even
[2350.72 - 2355.36] P:1844.30 E:0.116212 |  though we're a million miles away from England and London it's very much a Premier League game
[2355.36 - 2363.04] P:1892.80 E:0.109662 |  there's a nice tempo to the game. Here come Chelsea, Giorncinho in possession 15-20 yards
[2363.04 - 2369.76] P:1910.09 E:0.110594 |  inside the Arsenal half is there to be a goal before halftime. They've got a cante right
[2369.76 - 2374.24] P:1892.25 E:0.107322 |  hand side of the midfield Chelsea in danger of losing it here but Aspelik-Quetta is able to
[2374.24 - 2381.20] P:1762.57 E:0.096656 |  backpedal and he holds on to the ball supported by Christensen just inside it. It's a good work
[2381.20 - 2387.28] P:1775.84 E:0.103143 |  here there you know one touch stop in around the halfway line and Chelsea creating a little bit
[2387.28 - 2393.68] P:1946.77 E:0.106497 |  of space here. Chance, Giroux, head to the baller, shoot save by Petticec and cleared away by Montréal
[2393.68 - 2399.44] P:1999.06 E:0.106945 |  that's two big saves. Czech has made in the game now still 0-0. Well if everyone in an
[2399.44 - 2404.24] P:1897.47 E:0.103974 |  example of one touch midfield play that was it and they cut through Arsenal brilliantly there
[2404.24 - 2410.08] P:1871.57 E:0.098673 |  couple of nice just touches and Giroux has a clear chance right on the edge of the box left foot
[2410.16 - 2416.08] P:1839.70 E:0.103854 |  slightly scuffed still a very very good save by Petticec if he needed to prove anything tonight
[2416.08 - 2422.48] P:1830.81 E:0.099946 |  there to his manager he just did. Yeah it was a good reaction from the man who turned 37 this
[2422.48 - 2428.96] P:1873.87 E:0.098136 |  month getting down agile to his left hand side to push it away from danger as well but more
[2428.96 - 2435.44] P:1864.91 E:0.100630 |  danger might be coming because Chelsea have got themselves a corner and starting out to take it
[2436.24 - 2444.48] P:1873.05 E:0.108718 |  is Petro with a busy penalty area awaited. Petro and Azard standing over the corner now
[2445.12 - 2451.28] P:1945.16 E:0.103494 |  Arsenal with all 11 players back inside the penalty area to defend five minutes to half time
[2451.28 - 2455.60] P:1894.80 E:0.102333 |  corner is swung in stretching was Christensen couldn't get a touch. Georgina's got room on the
[2455.60 - 2459.28] P:1927.51 E:0.096084 |  edge of the box back in looking for Olivier Giroux does win the header down away from goal
[2459.28 - 2464.64] P:1951.61 E:0.100614 |  Petro tries to follow on and his volley is deflected away off and Arsenal defender Montréal
[2464.72 - 2469.84] P:1870.72 E:0.098099 |  and that goes out for a corner another corner to Chelsea who will remain on the attack for now
[2470.88 - 2473.92] P:1753.68 E:0.111486 |  they're trying to block there trying to free Louis up around the back he
[2475.20 - 2480.00] P:1848.11 E:0.108563 |  a couple of players just interfering with Arsenal players trying to get him free.
[2480.00 - 2484.48] P:1884.02 E:0.102338 |  Louis is a big threat from set plays particularly across that near post and he's gone again into
[2484.48 - 2490.40] P:1886.59 E:0.103849 |  that far post position to run across the near. Here comes the corner played by Eden Azard check comes
[2490.48 - 2495.68] P:1881.03 E:0.102871 |  and punches good goalkeeping picked up by Petro on the edge of the penalty area left
[2495.68 - 2499.76] P:1832.85 E:0.095380 |  hand side as Chelsea come forward clever ball into space for Angola Cante but his first
[2499.76 - 2504.08] P:1819.60 E:0.099096 |  touch isn't great and then he's got a retreat and gives it to Emerson as in the centre circle
[2504.08 - 2509.28] P:1757.79 E:0.097109 |  Arsenal being forced back at the moment and Golo Cante out to David Luis who's in a right wing
[2509.28 - 2513.92] P:1823.69 E:0.101081 |  position for some reason which is which is a very David Luis thing to be here he is again
[2513.92 - 2521.04] P:1794.15 E:0.094593 |  right hand side of the midfield picking up possession scrappy hair just easily drifting
[2521.04 - 2525.76] P:1829.13 E:0.110532 |  in the wind as he plays it in field towards the Arsenal penalty area that a foul is given away by
[2525.76 - 2531.76] P:1828.63 E:0.099712 |  Kovacic and Arsenal get another free kick and again no card Lucas Terraro was the player who was down
[2532.32 - 2536.80] P:1646.63 E:0.116992 |  How many it's hard to imagine why at 41 minutes we haven't had a yellow card yet in a European
[2536.80 - 2540.40] P:1709.35 E:0.092367 |  final because there's been enough fouls the referee's been quite tolerant I think it's from
[2540.40 - 2546.16] P:1788.72 E:0.099934 |  Italy so unusual for them they usually get the cards going they do yeah and Golo Cante
[2546.16 - 2550.80] P:1828.32 E:0.099124 |  flicks it over the top of Shack it tries to run around but he handles it then as he tries to
[2550.80 - 2557.68] P:1771.19 E:0.096542 |  control free kick to Arsenal bang on the halfway line Chelsea now Arsenal mill five live and BBC
[2557.68 - 2566.40] P:1744.14 E:0.097139 |  Radio London this game kicking off at 11 p.m local time in Baku so it's uh it's coming up to a
[2566.40 - 2572.96] P:1816.27 E:0.104325 |  quarter to midnight now christiansen wins the ball ahead of Lacazette and sets Chelsea in motion
[2572.96 - 2578.64] P:1758.49 E:0.100474 |  this is he did as on inside the centre circle it's got emerson making a good one outside it but he
[2578.64 - 2583.44] P:1922.22 E:0.111457 |  might need him here this is really good from as hard he shrugs off a couple of challenges now he
[2583.44 - 2588.48] P:1891.19 E:0.107893 |  gives it to emerson just inside the penalty area mate lanals is having a good game comes across
[2588.48 - 2595.20] P:1844.15 E:0.098276 |  and makes the challenge but offside flag was raised anyway against emerson and that will be a free
[2595.20 - 2600.16] P:1796.25 E:0.095989 |  kick to Arsenal and they'll clear their lines little nil it's strange really because you know
[2600.16 - 2606.08] P:1769.96 E:0.101988 |  well I think Chelsea they usually um have a lion's share of possession dictate the play dictate the
[2606.08 - 2610.32] P:1684.58 E:0.106677 |  play and have their moments tonight they're even though they've had a good share of possession
[2610.32 - 2615.76] P:1733.41 E:0.104597 |  they might even be edging it Arsenal look better in possession particularly in that last third where
[2615.76 - 2619.68] P:1758.51 E:0.093568 |  the two wing backs have got in Chelsea look better actually on the counter attack which you would
[2619.68 - 2624.64] P:1768.57 E:0.098927 |  expect it to have been the other way around tonight so that's just a slight difference in terms of
[2624.64 - 2629.36] P:1715.05 E:0.097543 |  what I was expecting Arsenal yet to have a shot on target in the match
[2630.88 - 2635.84] P:1807.84 E:0.105504 |  Chelsea have had a couple now where they've tested better check and he has stood up and made the
[2635.84 - 2642.40] P:1865.62 E:0.099495 |  saves last time Chelsea played in a Europa League final the winning goal came very late
[2642.40 - 2649.12] P:1831.66 E:0.095148 |  Branislav Ivanovich 93rd minute winner to win the Europa League might go all the way to the
[2649.12 - 2654.56] P:1780.13 E:0.104941 |  wire tonight extra time penalties if necessary to separate these London rivals as Socrattus as
[2654.56 - 2659.28] P:1929.01 E:0.103731 |  well here up against Covertich and clears the ball away but it goes out of play and that's
[2659.28 - 2664.80] P:1784.74 E:0.099819 |  going to be a throw into Chelsea left hand side as they come forward time ticks on 90 seconds of
[2664.80 - 2669.76] P:1694.75 E:0.101476 |  normal time remaining in this first half there'll be a little bit added on the stop which is as well
[2671.36 - 2677.12] P:1721.87 E:0.100691 |  Emerson prepares to take 10 yards inside the Arsenal half gets it back from Covertich now
[2677.12 - 2681.84] P:1850.64 E:0.105122 |  Covertich takes it on himself always don't matter if he can keep it in play and he doesn't
[2681.84 - 2687.60] P:1824.08 E:0.097639 |  a little bit like Ozilonio Arnibus scampering after it as it trickled along the white touch line
[2687.60 - 2690.96] P:1711.86 E:0.099901 |  book goes out of play for an Arsenal throw-in right full-back position for them
[2694.00 - 2697.84] P:1757.77 E:0.111939 |  so we were saying when you burst through like that you know it's running out of play but it's
[2697.84 - 2702.00] P:1595.33 E:0.108432 |  not running out faster than having you got to chase it down that's what happened there
[2702.00 - 2706.32] P:1676.25 E:0.101908 |  he knew it was going out I mean it's been a great first half I've really enjoyed it
[2706.96 - 2711.84] P:1756.75 E:0.103682 |  the goal action has been limited but some good chances and both managers will have
[2712.40 - 2718.00] P:1810.60 E:0.105323 |  different problems to deal with Arsenal who have shared the goals around in the Europa League this
[2718.00 - 2722.40] P:1724.05 E:0.108976 |  season they've had 12 different scorers in this competition not including own goals
[2723.20 - 2725.92] P:1714.55 E:0.102362 |  but so far they've yet to properly test Kepa
[2727.20 - 2730.72] P:1714.58 E:0.114341 |  the moment they're struggling to play it out of their own half for Bamyang with a touch into
[2732.16 - 2735.76] P:1684.70 E:0.108539 |  Lucas Terera who tries to return it over the top but it's cut out by Christensen
[2735.76 - 2739.60] P:1816.55 E:0.101289 |  Giroud knew he was coming back from an offside position so he doesn't challenge forward in
[2739.60 - 2745.12] P:1709.39 E:0.099569 |  the ball trickles out of play for a throw-in to Arsenal on the far side reminder will be live
[2745.76 - 2752.08] P:1768.28 E:0.099915 |  in Madrid building up to the Champions League final this weekend tomorrow the start of the
[2752.08 - 2757.68] P:1747.40 E:0.102533 |  cricket world cup every ball of every match live across the tournament on five live and five live
[2757.68 - 2763.60] P:1732.47 E:0.107125 |  sports extra. Arsenal's throw-in has been delayed and the reason for that is because the referee
[2763.60 - 2768.80] P:1996.99 E:0.110651 |  has decided there won't be anything added on for stoppages so they make their way towards the
[2768.80 - 2775.76] P:1879.58 E:0.100494 |  changing rooms all square nil nil both teams having created some chances but we await a break
[2775.76 - 2781.52] P:1814.16 E:0.096507 |  in the deadlock. Alibar, Geoff. Yeah I mean I feist the affair and I have to say some good quality
[2781.52 - 2787.28] P:1970.87 E:0.108988 |  on the pitch it's hard to say who has really got the upper hand here because I think it's so
[2787.52 - 2793.04] P:2008.14 E:0.115081 |  even slightly played out differently to what I expected but Arsenal have done really well I'd
[2793.04 - 2797.52] P:1860.21 E:0.096787 |  be really pleased if I was the Arsenal manager if I was the Chelsea manager I would definitely be
[2797.52 - 2803.44] P:1782.40 E:0.100200 |  concerned about the two win backs and I'll be talking to Hazard maybe to counteract that and
[2803.44 - 2810.16] P:1952.87 E:0.111729 |  Pedro just a wee bit more than they are. Hazard has shown a few glimpses Arsenal remember must win
[2810.16 - 2816.32] P:2006.63 E:0.100373 |  this final to get in the Champions League for next season for now in Baku at the break it's
[2816.32 - 2823.44] P:2026.74 E:0.106390 |  Chelsea nil Arsenal nil. Well your thoughts on 8505 885 live sport on social media Richard
[2823.44 - 2828.24] P:2041.33 E:0.102441 |  shame on those questioning Peter check and how much he cares he's saved us twice so far
[2828.96 - 2834.00] P:2010.56 E:0.105073 |  neat stop from Giroud there in the closing stages wasn't it Rob says you a for doing their bit for
[2834.00 - 2840.24] P:1978.36 E:0.095191 |  grassroots football by reproducing the atmosphere of park football in a major final I think I think
[2840.24 - 2845.52] P:1940.13 E:0.098124 |  our effects Mike is turned up to the max this evening Rob you might be right James that was a
[2845.52 - 2848.96] P:1909.31 E:0.105064 |  clear penalty for Arsenal even with the AR they've managed to get this wrong well let's go straight
[2848.96 - 2854.48] P:1716.94 E:0.092999 |  to Andy Townsend and Lee Dixon here in the studio with me on that you've had the benefit of the
[2854.48 - 2859.68] P:1501.17 E:0.094227 |  of replays it was a very swift decision Lee wasn't it yeah absolutely I think it was probably Vaar
[2859.68 - 2866.00] P:1669.57 E:0.075802 |  working at his best I did I thought at the time that the foot had gone in and it was a penalty I
[2866.00 - 2870.40] P:1779.63 E:0.083689 |  think Vaar I think just about got it right if that's possible with Vaar you know it's supposed to
[2870.40 - 2874.64] P:1410.83 E:0.089768 |  clear up everything it doesn't there's a couple of angles where there was a little bit of contact
[2875.20 - 2880.32] P:1691.08 E:0.092785 |  was there enough to bring him down etc I Andy I think Vaar got it just about right yeah the
[2880.32 - 2884.40] P:1773.63 E:0.089152 |  referee has always looked for the direction that the ball travels in those tight situations when
[2884.40 - 2889.28] P:1798.81 E:0.084644 |  you've got an on rushing goalkeeper trying to confront a striker the ball appeared that
[2889.28 - 2892.80] P:1350.57 E:0.083186 |  Lacazette had always made first contact with whether or not there was any contact really with
[2892.80 - 2898.16] P:1894.22 E:0.085554 |  Kepper I actually thought that that it was the right call there wasn't significant contact
[2898.16 - 2903.20] P:1599.64 E:0.082817 |  certainly from the angles that we saw here in the studio but but you're right Jonathan it was a
[2903.20 - 2908.48] P:1777.88 E:0.090869 |  very quick call there was no debate no no dilly dallying there they absolutely made that decision
[2908.48 - 2914.40] P:1909.08 E:0.093085 |  very very quickly okay tactics from the first half two things I want your views on one as Alan
[2914.40 - 2919.52] P:1906.14 E:0.104684 |  Padreau says that the room the space for the Arsenal wing backs Lee Maitland Niles on the right
[2919.52 - 2926.64] P:1934.58 E:0.093812 |  Clasinac on the left what more can Chelsea do to remove that space well a plane very narrow as we've
[2926.64 - 2931.92] P:1511.11 E:0.090531 |  seen and you know Azad and Pedro are not really coming back to help out the midfield so the midfields
[2931.92 - 2937.12] P:1871.09 E:0.087460 |  getting drawn into the to the centre of the pitch where Chelsea are protecting the back four and
[2937.12 - 2941.84] P:2046.45 E:0.101394 |  they're just getting hit down the sides and I think that's been their key weapon for Arsenal
[2941.84 - 2945.92] P:1655.60 E:0.094742 |  Alan was right the way that Clasinac has got in Maitland Niles are causing problems they've got
[2945.92 - 2950.64] P:1951.94 E:0.084492 |  the two up front so that's engaging the two centre backs the two full backs are going quite
[2950.64 - 2954.80] P:1849.14 E:0.088893 |  narrow as well because they're conscious about the two up front so they're trying to that four
[2954.80 - 2959.12] P:1789.86 E:0.091880 |  are trying to nullify the two and that's leaving the space down the sides I think Arsenal got it
[2959.12 - 2963.76] P:1774.72 E:0.077680 |  absolutely right but when you look at what Chelsea have done they've had the better chances yeah
[2964.32 - 2969.36] P:1829.75 E:0.084019 |  the one thing Lee I think that Maitland Niles and Clasinac have got to be better when they get in
[2969.36 - 2973.76] P:1898.86 E:0.087952 |  those areas where they're where they're exposing Chelsea a little bit the delivery into the box
[2973.76 - 2977.44] P:1932.33 E:0.087022 |  has got to be there you've got to make the most of that a couple of times we saw Maitland Niles
[2978.08 - 2981.60] P:1864.41 E:0.096695 |  just not quite stand it up we've seen Colisean actually take a touch when he could have hit
[2981.60 - 2986.24] P:1925.07 E:0.091383 |  things first time I think when you get in those areas and you and and you find yourself in good
[2986.24 - 2989.84] P:1875.70 E:0.090411 |  positions you've got to make the right call you've got to produce that bit of quality to really
[2989.84 - 2993.68] P:1944.86 E:0.090349 |  make it count but there was one moment wasn't there a beautiful ball through to Clasinac
[2993.68 - 2999.60] P:1719.31 E:0.103224 |  on the overlap yeah stayed on side he's down by the byline abamie and Lacazette are waiting for it
[2999.60 - 3004.24] P:1438.79 E:0.096104 |  six hour box yep and he takes a touch he takes a touch for the first time and you mentioned a name
[3004.24 - 3009.84] P:1728.56 E:0.078458 |  to me did I Andy Robertson with that dick oh it was Lee mentioned that and he's right who would
[3009.84 - 3013.60] P:1872.48 E:0.085392 |  have played that first time right yeah exactly would have just done done done it a little bit
[3013.60 - 3018.00] P:1800.90 E:0.092685 |  more quicker and more instinctively and it was the right thing to do doing it first time I think
[3018.00 - 3022.80] P:1862.41 E:0.082596 |  Arsenal played well played with good control in the first 20 minutes 25 minutes Chelsea have
[3022.80 - 3026.80] P:1609.60 E:0.084555 |  have looked a little bit menacing at times particularly when Azar gets on the ball and
[3026.80 - 3031.44] P:1797.01 E:0.080822 |  starts bumping in the people looking to get it back but but it's tight there's nothing much in
[3031.44 - 3036.80] P:1903.17 E:0.085046 |  this game and it again it's that those decisions I spoke about before the game not just without the
[3036.80 - 3041.52] P:1762.16 E:0.083904 |  ball with the ball at your feet making the right call to to provide an opportunity for someone
[3041.52 - 3045.84] P:1720.59 E:0.092394 |  might be the turning point here some more of your thoughts Adams and Chelsea fan no gameplay
[3045.84 - 3051.04] P:1664.05 E:0.101462 |  from us just random flicks losing possession less said about our defense the better hope we get lucky
[3051.04 - 3054.56] P:1864.30 E:0.095136 |  uh Anish says I'd love to see make the Niles playing as a winger next season
[3054.56 - 3060.24] P:1807.06 E:0.081647 |  when Bellerin comes back in um second tactical theme I'd like to just expand upon this this
[3060.24 - 3066.72] P:1769.42 E:0.090723 |  Arsenal press Alan Pardew great work from Jacques and from Terera and goodness me even Mesut Erzel
[3066.80 - 3072.24] P:1865.24 E:0.088849 |  what more can Chelsea do to to bypass that press because Arsenal are dominating that in that area
[3072.24 - 3079.36] P:2030.36 E:0.092586 |  aren't they yeah I mean um I think that uh Ozil when he's got on the ball has been very very good
[3079.36 - 3084.88] P:2090.47 E:0.101816 |  actually and um he's drifted into wide areas as well at times and of course that causes the
[3084.88 - 3090.00] P:2088.31 E:0.091413 |  center backs of Chelsea problems because he doubles up then with a wing back so you know
[3090.00 - 3097.44] P:2092.69 E:0.099344 |  Ozil has been very very good um I think Arsenal have been terrific actually and uh Chelsea ironically
[3097.44 - 3103.44] P:2077.15 E:0.096912 |  best moments probably have been on the counter attack thanks Adam we'll let you get a cup of tea
[3103.44 - 3110.88] P:1857.42 E:0.093142 |  or whatever you're offered there in in Baku as as a late night midnight feast um what what do you
[3110.88 - 3117.60] P:1564.81 E:0.070311 |  think guys on that I mean Terera has been impressive hasn't he yeah I think in order for Arsenal to win
[3117.60 - 3122.24] P:1677.20 E:0.071527 |  this game they've got to be good in midfield we they've got to stop that possession that
[3122.24 - 3127.84] P:1118.03 E:0.082817 |  Georgino we talked about before the game have they done that yeah they have and they've pressed him
[3127.84 - 3133.28] P:1393.25 E:0.079867 |  enough for him not to get easy ball out yeah and I think Cante you know to get the ball out to you
[3133.28 - 3139.84] P:1596.03 E:0.075132 |  know um Covertix for me is is a passenger in this midfield you know we haven't seen an awful lot of
[3139.84 - 3145.52] P:1617.62 E:0.079345 |  him and they're relying on Pedro and and Azar to just hit them on the break the worrying thing for
[3145.52 - 3150.40] P:1561.73 E:0.063103 |  Arsenal is the amount of shots they've had the amount of shots on target obviously is difference
[3150.40 - 3154.88] P:1537.77 E:0.065016 |  than the the difference because Chelsea have had a couple of shots Peter Cech's made a couple of
[3154.88 - 3158.80] P:1554.75 E:0.087589 |  decent saves one he should make the other one was a good save getting down as you really should have
[3158.80 - 3163.12] P:1335.29 E:0.085473 |  done better I think we talked about that me and Andy saying he didn't really get his shot away with
[3163.12 - 3168.08] P:1378.39 E:0.085340 |  a lot of power but it was a good save that's the worrying thing is Chelsea haven't really been in the
[3168.08 - 3172.80] P:1383.82 E:0.054228 |  game from a possession and tactics point of view but they've had the better chances well of lovely
[3172.88 - 3177.12] P:1307.03 E:0.105359 |  azard moments though on the edge of the box Andy tells it hasn't quite happened for him in terms of
[3177.12 - 3182.40] P:1673.57 E:0.092457 |  the final product but is there enough there from him to suggest that we could see something decisive
[3182.40 - 3186.88] P:1206.05 E:0.089254 |  in the next 45 from him at any given moment when he picks the ball up 30 yards out and he's got the
[3186.88 - 3190.80] P:1601.69 E:0.080191 |  ball at his feet and all of a sudden you see a wall of Arsenal players between him and the and
[3190.80 - 3196.80] P:1594.34 E:0.074036 |  the penalty spot and yet a couple of swift one-touch passes and he can find himself just a fraction
[3196.80 - 3204.24] P:1529.82 E:0.075894 |  away from getting a shot on target he's that good in those tight areas I think that again I
[3204.24 - 3208.56] P:1479.61 E:0.074201 |  think Unai Emery will be very pleased with the way that his Arsenal team have played but I think
[3208.56 - 3215.20] P:1600.62 E:0.063968 |  having been slightly better than Chelsea in that first 45 they've got to score first here I just get
[3215.20 - 3219.36] P:1409.39 E:0.075499 |  the feeling for Arsenal Lee I think if Chelsea score first I don't know why I just get the feeling
[3219.36 - 3223.52] P:1371.00 E:0.077897 |  that they might go on and get it done I think Arsenal have got to make it count whilst they're
[3223.60 - 3227.92] P:1288.63 E:0.087590 |  whilst they're enjoying good possession we've seen their press is good tonight Arsenal but they're
[3227.92 - 3232.80] P:1355.07 E:0.077108 |  notoriously bad when they get hit on the break when they've got possession they can get too many
[3232.80 - 3237.44] P:1053.00 E:0.089011 |  men forward and they can get me I'm out of goals last season we saw him get hit on the break like
[3237.44 - 3242.40] P:1386.91 E:0.075103 |  how does that happen you know you've got to see the danger before it comes and make sure you don't
[3242.40 - 3246.96] P:884.34 E:0.087651 |  leave 1v1 at the back which they've been guilty of before if you leave 1v1 with Azar knocking about
[3246.96 - 3251.20] P:1381.34 E:0.083238 |  you're going to be in big trouble and you just feel as the game goes on Azar's going to have a little
[3251.20 - 3257.36] P:1556.24 E:0.062707 |  bit more of the important play and I mean that in the last in the last third second half to come

[3454.32 - 3458.48] P:1709.83 E:0.090120 |  there has been a bit of a break here which has disrupted the momentum of these teams
[3459.12 - 3464.48] P:1128.91 E:0.083432 |  well you're always going to get that I mean I've been two weeks I know that the Arsenal have had
[3464.48 - 3469.28] P:1053.26 E:0.080640 |  a practice game behind closed doors so they've had a little bit of a run out whether that's
[3469.28 - 3476.40] P:1540.37 E:0.069699 |  competitively whether that's competitive enough going into a final not too sure I don't think it
[3476.40 - 3479.68] P:1435.69 E:0.087702 |  makes that much difference to be honest we don't think you need to be playing every three days in

[3518.96 - 3522.72] P:1497.62 E:0.079245 |  think it's been a disappointing game I think it's been what I expect I think Arsenal played
[3522.72 - 3527.04] P:1384.57 E:0.085821 |  particularly well and can't taste lasted when you know there were the doubts after what we saw in the
[3527.04 - 3532.08] P:1729.86 E:0.085770 |  warm-up and hearing his manager pre-match he obviously wasn't so sure he's been a bit sloppy
[3532.08 - 3536.48] P:1147.62 E:0.072269 |  in possession a couple of times he's not the greatest number eight in the world let's be honest
[3536.48 - 3541.20] P:1524.98 E:0.069173 |  he's he's fantastic at what he does but he's not he's not the most amazing forward player
[3542.40 - 3546.96] P:1400.89 E:0.082815 |  so but he's been okay and he looks he looks fit then he looks like he's gonna go through it yeah
[3547.12 - 3550.64] P:1333.61 E:0.078882 |  I think he's not his best but I think you can get away with doing what he's doing
[3550.64 - 3554.08] P:1418.79 E:0.075326 |  and these other players on that pitch that are going to win Chelsea this game it's not
[3554.08 - 3559.04] P:1532.08 E:0.077455 |  can't can't he'll do his job but they're looking at the the pointed end of the pitch with you know
[3559.04 - 3563.52] P:1503.59 E:0.087801 |  Pedro it and I'm on the break and obviously as I think as the game gets on and the you get a little
[3563.52 - 3569.44] P:1496.90 E:0.078314 |  bit tired in a final as well and the big comes a lot at stake towards in the last 20 minutes of
[3569.44 - 3574.88] P:1602.14 E:0.076870 |  this game one mistake and all of a sudden you see drifting away then it could get a little bit twitchy
[3574.88 - 3578.80] P:1312.79 E:0.078123 |  and that's when people would normally make mistakes when you get a bit nervous what about that point
[3578.80 - 3583.36] P:1486.23 E:0.100755 |  from Anisha read out just before the news about mate lanar's obviously when bellerine comes back
[3583.36 - 3589.52] P:1832.94 E:0.083749 |  in we would assume he is still Arsenal's number one choice on the right could you see a situation
[3589.52 - 3594.64] P:1752.93 E:0.085738 |  where he maybe shuffles his formation to accommodate both well he's done enough in that wing back
[3594.64 - 3599.84] P:1155.18 E:0.069522 |  position I still I don't think he's a right fullback personally I think he's a he can play wing
[3599.84 - 3604.32] P:1390.93 E:0.080888 |  back he can play midfield I don't think that's where he'll end up playing a lot of his football
[3604.32 - 3610.08] P:1533.89 E:0.086894 |  so he's his mate do has been brilliant because he has filled in that gap bellerine still needs a lot
[3610.08 - 3615.28] P:1329.94 E:0.074244 |  of coaching he needs a lot to learn about that right back position again very good going forward
[3615.28 - 3620.48] P:1405.37 E:0.068759 |  defensively I would question both of them as a right back as such they're both great wing backs
[3621.52 - 3626.64] P:1388.04 E:0.077394 |  but it's dependent as Andy said before we still don't know what Arsenal's best position is
[3627.28 - 3631.84] P:1456.80 E:0.082658 |  from the back four point of Euro back five they still keeps chopping and changing he does that
[3631.84 - 3637.28] P:1590.25 E:0.072030 |  to protect some certain players in positions Calasino he's not a left back so they play wing
[3637.28 - 3643.52] P:1619.54 E:0.072770 |  back so and I think they're still can't he's not sure and personnel in the summer who he signs in
[3643.52 - 3649.36] P:1702.71 E:0.066773 |  the summer personnel will decide what system they play long term and also on Chelsea I mean big
[3649.36 - 3654.40] P:1714.47 E:0.095010 |  summer ahead in terms of possible reshuffling Andy as the teams come out just a quick thought on
[3654.40 - 3658.56] P:1616.93 E:0.097233 |  on what may happen you know players are going to go they've got long-term injuries now as well
[3658.56 - 3664.96] P:1480.35 E:0.078134 |  correct big 45 minutes Jonathan now in for many many different reasons from for the manager for
[3664.96 - 3670.16] P:1519.57 E:0.078663 |  players moving forward for the club moving forward so it's a it's a significant 45 minutes
[3670.16 - 3675.52] P:1810.38 E:0.087807 |  certainly for both teams okay well nine o'clock here in the UK means that the clock is just ticking
[3675.52 - 3683.52] P:1807.03 E:0.096499 |  past midnight out in Baku in Azerbaijan and well it's nil nil we could still have extra time we
[3683.52 - 3689.20] P:1705.34 E:0.093515 |  could have penalties it's the Europa League final live on five live sport and here's the second half
[3689.20 - 3696.16] P:1831.05 E:0.098878 |  inside the stadium Alan Pardieu and Conor McNamara and still Chelsea now Arsenal nil for now just
[3696.16 - 3701.52] P:1803.66 E:0.100311 |  looking over some of the stats at halftime obama yang had the fewest touches of the ball of any
[3701.52 - 3706.64] P:1829.19 E:0.101647 |  player in the pitch just nine touches of the ball one of them was a shot that he skewed wide to the
[3706.64 - 3712.96] P:1801.53 E:0.096322 |  target no changes in personnel from either team over the break will get back underway with the same
[3712.96 - 3720.08] P:1812.71 E:0.095778 |  elevens that started this match it's late into the night in Baku we have passed midnight
[3721.20 - 3726.88] P:1864.79 E:0.105155 |  and here we go for the second half of this Europa League final Chelsea now playing from left to
[3726.88 - 3732.00] P:1853.58 E:0.098050 |  right as we look down in their blue shirts and shorts the white socks Arsenal in red
[3732.80 - 3736.40] P:1840.92 E:0.108047 |  Chelsea trying to get it up to Olivier Chirou but he can't make it stick on the edge of the area
[3736.64 - 3743.12] P:1877.61 E:0.104943 |  Terera does well to feed it away now a bit of room for Obamayang running with long strides making
[3743.12 - 3747.44] P:1843.06 E:0.101736 |  up an off-road across getting to the edge of the penalty area his cross deflects off the toes of
[3747.44 - 3751.44] P:1821.64 E:0.094308 |  David Louise not an intentional back pass and picked up by the goalkeeper Alan Pardieu
[3751.44 - 3755.92] P:1793.95 E:0.106637 |  well he's had more touches there probably than he did in the first half he had a run he had about
[3755.92 - 3760.24] P:1825.47 E:0.096936 |  seven touches but he just showed his pace there and again they're just down now in the signs of
[3760.24 - 3766.16] P:1793.08 E:0.102213 |  Chelsea's the worry Chelsea go long controlled down by Olivier Chirou five yards outside the
[3766.16 - 3771.60] P:1690.96 E:0.101500 |  Arsenal penalty area support behind from Pedro and the Arsenal defenders just for a moment stand
[3771.60 - 3777.20] P:1764.80 E:0.100482 |  off Pedro so he cuts in field on his right boot and gives it to Ingolecante 15-20 yards outside
[3777.20 - 3782.32] P:1601.08 E:0.099353 |  the Arsenal penalty area Pedro now picks it up on the right wing and there's a nice delicate touch
[3782.32 - 3787.84] P:1733.74 E:0.096560 |  from Eden Azard to encourage Aspelacueta forward good build up this from Chelsea Ingolecante
[3787.84 - 3792.72] P:1660.81 E:0.101696 |  back to Aspelacueta level with the edge of the penalty area right hand side as they come forward
[3792.72 - 3796.88] P:1711.81 E:0.101981 |  Arsenal have hardly had a touch since the game got back underway here's a chance for Ingolecante
[3796.88 - 3801.52] P:1869.98 E:0.099526 |  to cross he tries to run along the edge of the byline but well challenged by Jacca and the ball
[3801.52 - 3807.28] P:1842.72 E:0.107612 |  goes out for a goal kick to Arsenal and their goalkeeper Peracek away to our right hand side
[3807.28 - 3813.84] P:1800.52 E:0.103976 |  so a reminder of the teams Kevin Goldferre Chelsea back for Aspelacueta, Christensen, David Louise
[3813.84 - 3819.44] P:1843.00 E:0.093901 |  and Emerson in midfield, Giorgio Gigno is the anchor with Ingolecante and Covacic alongside him
[3819.44 - 3825.12] P:1743.02 E:0.095043 |  and then Pedro and Azard in support of Olivier Chirou up front Arsenal come over the halfway
[3825.12 - 3829.12] P:1870.67 E:0.093967 |  line with Colasinash forward to Mesut Erzl first touch was a bit heavy nearly gets through to
[3829.12 - 3833.28] P:1766.88 E:0.097392 |  Lacazette though David Louise back pedals wins ahead on the edge of his own penalty area and then
[3833.28 - 3838.88] P:1782.18 E:0.097520 |  Covacic down for the left back Emerson who clears it up towards the halfway line the Arsenal team
[3838.88 - 3843.76] P:1849.06 E:0.102196 |  check in goal three central offenders Socrates, Kishelny and Montréal make them miles and
[3843.76 - 3849.12] P:1834.51 E:0.111340 |  Colasinash with the wing backs then Jacque Terera and Ozil and then the top two Obamian and like
[3849.12 - 3852.72] P:1890.18 E:0.106965 |  I said here comes Chelsea on the counter attack good work to get to the edge of the penalty
[3852.72 - 3858.64] P:1882.41 E:0.095027 |  area Chirou's cross takes an affliction but it goes out I think for a corner and the referee has got
[3858.64 - 3863.76] P:1796.91 E:0.097020 |  two players on the ground to deal with here but Chelsea beginning to look more and more dangerous
[3863.76 - 3868.32] P:1792.84 E:0.097605 |  on this counter attack and they had plenty pace there as they almost created the chance for Chirou
[3869.12 - 3874.00] P:1916.84 E:0.111607 |  just stayed on side drew and as Aydan carried on his run he just went straight into one of the
[3874.00 - 3879.28] P:1749.66 E:0.110818 |  centre backs it wasn't a deliberate foul but Real certainly wasn't getting out of the way he made
[3879.28 - 3884.24] P:1767.57 E:0.101165 |  sure he stopped hazards going forward there but there's a corner for Chelsea and a good start
[3884.24 - 3890.24] P:1789.17 E:0.103036 |  by them a little bit a little bit livelier than perhaps they ended the first half just seeing a
[3890.24 - 3894.56] P:1742.65 E:0.118066 |  replay of that and Montréal certainly knows what he's doing blocking as are there his eyes are on
[3894.56 - 3898.80] P:1847.30 E:0.104433 |  him you could see where the collision was coming and he made sure as I would not be able to
[3899.12 - 3904.40] P:1830.59 E:0.103710 |  get on the end of a one-two here's the resultant corner taken by the Belgian terrible corner
[3904.40 - 3909.52] P:1862.14 E:0.101542 |  short right footed and clued away by the first defender who was Terera and Chelsea will remain
[3909.52 - 3914.64] P:1754.16 E:0.094930 |  on the attack with a throw in which has a hard threatens to take but I think he's going to leave
[3914.64 - 3920.64] P:1810.17 E:0.105322 |  it there says Eraspelakweta who started every Premier League game this past season for Chelsea
[3922.80 - 3927.60] P:1773.19 E:0.112714 |  it takes his time over this throwing just over 10 yards from the corner flag that Chelsea attacked
[3927.60 - 3932.88] P:1705.06 E:0.099407 |  down the right hand side Chelsea nil Arsenal nil in the wee hours in Baku
[3934.00 - 3938.08] P:1808.77 E:0.104163 |  header away by Montréal working hard for those Georgino gets it back for Chelsea
[3938.08 - 3941.36] P:1782.69 E:0.099278 |  Kovacic into a bit of space for Emerson five yards as of the penalty area
[3941.36 - 3948.00] P:2008.11 E:0.118149 |  President Zerouz diving header Olivia Zerouz scores against his old club
[3948.56 - 3956.64] P:1987.52 E:0.116537 |  he is now the standalone top scorer in the Europa League this season and once again it happens
[3956.64 - 3964.48] P:2052.80 E:0.120675 |  a player comes back to halt his former employers that was a killer header from Olivia Zerouz
[3965.04 - 3973.20] P:1953.43 E:0.123602 |  Chelsea won Arsenal nil four minutes played in the second half that was a textbook centre forward
[3973.20 - 3979.44] P:1949.41 E:0.125064 |  goal that the ball that comes in from the wide area is quite low and flat but he gets across
[3979.44 - 3986.48] P:1832.33 E:0.125091 |  the centre half and gives all he muster all his effort to get across him stoop low and bury that
[3986.48 - 3992.88] P:1841.51 E:0.126413 |  in the corner Peter check no chance that is a class goal from a striker who's banging form in
[3992.88 - 4000.00] P:1831.69 E:0.124597 |  terms of Europe in this competition for sure that is now 11 goals in 14 appearances in this
[4000.00 - 4006.40] P:1860.63 E:0.112362 |  competition Olivia Zerouz the World Cup winner the former Arsenal player has scored against his
[4006.40 - 4010.40] P:1854.64 E:0.104532 |  old club tonight and this is going to live and think something you had just mentioned at the
[4010.40 - 4015.04] P:1894.97 E:0.103164 |  part you have Chelsea came out with a renewed vigor at the start to the second half and they've
[4015.04 - 4021.60] P:1948.30 E:0.108965 |  been rewarded for it yeah a little stir from the manager maybe to sort of live and stuff up quick
[4021.68 - 4027.12] P:1920.50 E:0.102565 |  quicker pay get to the get to possession quicker and they certainly did and Arsenal just caught on
[4027.12 - 4032.00] P:1737.75 E:0.116750 |  their heels in that period and you know when you come out a half time as a manager you're wondering
[4032.00 - 4038.32] P:1793.53 E:0.108660 |  ever got the mood right free kick now to Arsenal so it's a game in which Arsenal were creating a
[4038.32 - 4044.16] P:1782.76 E:0.103002 |  lot of chances during a purple patch of the first half when they didn't score and now Chelsea who've
[4044.16 - 4049.12] P:1845.29 E:0.102361 |  been increasingly warming up and getting into the swing of things have broken the deadlock Olivia
[4050.08 - 4054.56] P:1814.75 E:0.100182 |  after 49 minutes free kick to Arsenal can they respond instantly
[4055.12 - 4059.52] P:1834.61 E:0.107649 |  jacket takes it wide from the left and a bad delivery there's a bit of a pinball machine
[4059.52 - 4064.72] P:1896.15 E:0.107867 |  off several players and then there's a push in a go to cad day and needlessly Arsenal have conceded
[4064.72 - 4071.52] P:1857.87 E:0.107232 |  a foul had a free kick to Chelsea that will relieve a lot of pressure and then we will be you know
[4071.52 - 4076.16] P:1782.09 E:0.117167 |  going over as a manager you stand on the sideline you see your team not start well second half and
[4076.16 - 4080.48] P:1854.91 E:0.111841 |  start picking your brains and did you get it right you know did you get the message right but
[4080.48 - 4086.64] P:1845.66 E:0.109574 |  Chelsea definitely have started the live here are the two teams and deserve their lead here we are
[4086.64 - 4095.28] P:1795.03 E:0.091370 |  on the shores of the Caspian Sea and Chelsea won the Lop in the Europa League final and that's
[4095.92 - 4100.72] P:1750.52 E:0.103265 |  at the moment that parade planned for Islington tomorrow is not going to be happening unless
[4101.44 - 4106.80] P:1752.01 E:0.102879 |  Arsenal could turn this around Chelsea in possession near the halfway line good work by
[4106.80 - 4110.72] P:1768.72 E:0.106270 |  Terera to win it back for Arsenal and then Joaquin your goes in strong and in go to
[4110.72 - 4115.44] P:1877.49 E:0.106764 |  cad day as well and chance of a counter attack here for Chelsea this is
[4116.96 - 4121.28] P:1786.41 E:0.115679 |  he didn't as hard weaving his way towards the edge of the Arsenal penalty area good work by
[4121.28 - 4126.80] P:1825.82 E:0.103859 |  Monreal to win that possession and now Arsenal will try and turn defense into attack as it is
[4126.88 - 4131.20] P:1793.64 E:0.104396 |  takes it over the halfway line pushes it in front of Obama Yang Arsenal have got a go for it now
[4131.20 - 4135.52] P:1886.54 E:0.106353 |  here's the cross too high for Lacazette and yeah the first half Colasalach had always gambled
[4135.52 - 4140.40] P:1931.39 E:0.097446 |  on making that run to the back post this time he doesn't the ball was played in that area but he
[4140.40 - 4145.04] P:1790.96 E:0.109381 |  was 30 40 yards back nearer to the halfway line and that was a fast break though I don't think
[4145.04 - 4150.72] P:1801.68 E:0.116019 |  really had a chance to get there to be fair but the Oyang is still the danger man really with
[4150.72 - 4155.36] P:1776.03 E:0.111035 |  that pace down that right flank and that's the side that Arsenal are going to have got down a
[4155.36 - 4161.04] P:1819.27 E:0.115942 |  couple of times in this half that's probably all of them Chelsea now got the noses in front
[4161.04 - 4167.76] P:1821.75 E:0.106960 |  they're very difficult when they're like this one nil to Chelsea the captain Aspelacueta takes
[4167.76 - 4173.84] P:1788.30 E:0.099683 |  the throw their goal scorer Olivia Giroux flicks it on all the talk about Petter check playing
[4173.84 - 4178.80] P:1773.66 E:0.110098 |  against his old club well it's it's another man who scored against his former teammates
[4179.52 - 4184.32] P:1882.65 E:0.112290 |  but it's over the deadlock here comes Eden as our good run twice around Socrates who did just
[4184.40 - 4190.32] P:1880.79 E:0.101433 |  enough as I had built up a foot head of steam there and the Greek defender was able to at least
[4190.32 - 4196.08] P:1855.24 E:0.099971 |  hold him up but Chelsea remain on the attack Pedro 15 yards outside the penalty area Chelsea enjoying
[4196.08 - 4202.16] P:1827.18 E:0.099909 |  themselves now playing it around with a bit more confidence Arsenal scrambling a little bit as Chelsea
[4202.16 - 4207.92] P:1848.78 E:0.098786 |  keep ball on the far side Kovacic back to the halfway line to David Louise it's incredible
[4207.92 - 4213.28] P:1908.33 E:0.103081 |  our goals change games but this has now become the Chelsea show as Angola can't a
[4213.28 - 4219.20] P:1889.85 E:0.109200 |  skips away from Montreal pushes it forward to Pedro Arsenal disoriented it cross comes in just

[4238.80 - 4243.76] P:1697.80 E:0.110689 |  still holding it so you know a ball that was really gone to be honest he did well to just go and try

[4270.64 - 4275.76] P:1840.62 E:0.100876 |  good one but Lacazette doesn't control it just to the moment these 10 minutes or so since half time
[4276.32 - 4283.12] P:1827.26 E:0.113334 |  not much is going Arsenal's way just seeing a repeat of the goal is a fantastic header I mean

[4322.08 - 4326.56] P:1894.50 E:0.106688 |  hang on so Pedro has said something to the referee he thought he was getting a free kick
[4326.56 - 4332.00] P:1891.14 E:0.100979 |  and when he didn't get it he's given some lip to the Italian official who does show the first yellow

[4349.60 - 4354.32] P:1875.38 E:0.100252 |  wasn't doing in the first half so that message has definitely got through Pedro the first man booked
[4354.32 - 4359.20] P:1743.52 E:0.102926 |  I remember commentating in a community shield a few seasons back when Pedro was sent off against

[4520.64 - 4527.68] P:1825.23 E:0.109611 |  and Maitland Niles has been very effective down that side good chance gets a deflection
[4527.68 - 4533.12] P:1773.33 E:0.105320 |  up and wide before Obamayang can get an overhead kick in there's a good challenge from Christensen

[4603.60 - 4608.16] P:1909.99 E:0.121245 |  takes a chance it looked like a foul to me but he ended up in right in the centre of the pitch

[4618.56 - 4625.12] P:1891.25 E:0.118168 |  beautifully with a with just a really little label and then Pedro on his left foot scoops it

[4639.60 - 4645.60] P:1859.78 E:0.097965 |  Mauricio Sarri said at halftime his team have come out in a perfectly determined mood they have
[4645.60 - 4651.52] P:1911.50 E:0.099500 |  been so professional so ruthless almost in the second half in and giving themselves a huge
[4651.52 - 4656.96] P:1764.10 E:0.103713 |  advantage now absolutely and you know those comments Peter check made about you know that hunger
[4656.96 - 4662.08] P:1820.08 E:0.106977 |  and desire to win trophies you've certainly seen that from Chelsea at the start in the second half
[4662.08 - 4668.16] P:1952.44 E:0.113097 |  and Arsenal nil got a really dig deep really dig deep and then the shape they're in not take chances
[4668.24 - 4672.64] P:2015.74 E:0.110748 |  because they're getting exposed here so it's a real test for Arsenal to make sure that they go
[4672.64 - 4676.32] P:1722.58 E:0.103800 |  about this in the right manner yeah those comments telling referring to an interview the standard
[4676.32 - 4680.40] P:1766.35 E:0.102174 |  today with the peter check where he said that when he was in the Chelsea dressing room even if they
[4680.40 - 4685.20] P:1800.91 E:0.099878 |  drew a match it felt like the end of the world it was a real will to win he said things have been
[4685.20 - 4689.36] P:1700.21 E:0.105818 |  far more relaxed at his time at Arsenal look people were told don't worry about it if you don't win a
[4689.36 - 4693.76] P:1766.51 E:0.098374 |  match and there wasn't that pressure applied he said things are improving a bit under Unai Emery
[4693.76 - 4698.72] P:1809.94 E:0.101643 |  but that that intensity is not quite there as it was in his Chelsea days and maybe that's what
[4698.72 - 4704.16] P:1896.69 E:0.102379 |  we're seeing in this Europa League final which is now firmly in Chelsea's favour if Arsenal are
[4704.16 - 4708.56] P:1851.95 E:0.105585 |  going to come back and win this trophy they're going to have to do it the hard way mind you it's
[4708.56 - 4713.60] P:1872.15 E:0.105403 |  been a season of dramatic comebacks in European football so I'm not ruling anything out just
[4713.60 - 4720.24] P:1817.80 E:0.099333 |  yet we've a half an hour still to play in Baku never say never in Europe this year for sure but
[4720.72 - 4726.24] P:1780.92 E:0.104455 |  you know this is going to be a hell of a mountain to climb for Arsenal two nil down against this team
[4726.72 - 4731.68] P:1854.29 E:0.107165 |  Arsenal I think preparing a change down there there's certainly been a discussion between
[4731.68 - 4736.96] P:1869.71 E:0.097819 |  Unai Emery and some of his backroom staff for the moment it's the same players that start to the
[4736.96 - 4741.28] P:1812.51 E:0.102442 |  game Drana Jacka here from the halfway line plays a wonderful ball out onto the chest of
[4741.28 - 4746.08] P:1818.58 E:0.099452 |  Mesut Erzal on the far side this is where Arsenal need Mesut Erzal to step up now and provide a
[4746.08 - 4750.32] P:1784.40 E:0.106308 |  little bit of magic they need something special he runs across the goal from right to left well
[4750.32 - 4756.56] P:1859.16 E:0.096568 |  outside the penalty area gives it off to Monreal now granted Jacka chips forward chested down by
[4756.56 - 4762.32] P:1811.13 E:0.100872 |  Kolasinat crossing position on the left hand side but swarmed by Chelsea defenders and unable to
[4762.32 - 4767.68] P:1880.56 E:0.103401 |  find the space that would be needed to send in across Jacka again 20 yards outside the box plays
[4767.68 - 4772.72] P:1908.11 E:0.109093 |  a crossfield ball looking for Maitland Niles excellent tracking back really good that was from
[4772.72 - 4778.64] P:1907.28 E:0.101010 |  Eden Azar to get back there and win possession and now Chelsea lose it in the midfield again
[4778.64 - 4784.72] P:1863.03 E:0.099675 |  and Arsenal have no time to waste here two nil down in Azar by Jean Monreal that's really clever
[4784.72 - 4790.08] P:1856.82 E:0.101520 |  scooped it away in front of Georgina but he then loses it Monreal and fighting for his covetage
[4790.08 - 4795.04] P:1850.06 E:0.106924 |  in the midfield there's an obvious pull in his shirt referee says play on oh well they didn't play
[4795.04 - 4799.52] P:1893.71 E:0.101017 |  on Chelsea because they thought the free kick was coming it was such an obvious pull in the shirt
[4799.52 - 4804.88] P:1850.17 E:0.094681 |  I don't blame the referee there Alan I think he's he's helped out Chelsea as much as he can there
[4804.88 - 4811.36] P:1849.32 E:0.093113 |  but Azar didn't continue the run and ultimately Chelsea lost possession but they'll come again
[4811.36 - 4816.24] P:1792.17 E:0.110007 |  yeah I mean in you know just after which it would ragged at the moment I just think they need to
[4816.24 - 4819.52] P:1702.09 E:0.109505 |  they need sort of five minutes to get themselves together there's also sort of
[4819.52 - 4824.96] P:1807.82 E:0.103577 |  courage in the midfield where's my midfield you know and Chelsea really got a good grip on this
[4824.96 - 4832.40] P:1822.67 E:0.099038 |  game at the moment. Arsenal are preparing to make not one but two changes one of them is Wobby
[4832.40 - 4836.80] P:1931.31 E:0.116316 |  the other Guendouzi here's a good run Covertich gets right to the edge of the penalty area
[4836.80 - 4842.40] P:1932.64 E:0.108723 |  challenged by Kishelny taken off him by Pedro Pedro de Chiroux who goes down well he goes down
[4842.40 - 4849.36] P:1966.40 E:0.111268 |  very dramatically and the referee points to the spot and Chelsea unless VA or get involved have
[4849.44 - 4855.92] P:1936.91 E:0.106438 |  got themselves a penalty here it was another slick slick build up from Chelsea who were
[4855.92 - 4859.68] P:1850.19 E:0.106961 |  proving to be headed shoulders better than their opponents in the second half.
[4859.68 - 4864.80] P:1838.44 E:0.107632 |  Giroud just as the ball came to him went down like a ton of breaks and the referee hardly
[4864.80 - 4871.04] P:1908.51 E:0.101014 |  hesitated pointing to the spot a penalty to Chelsea a chance to get a three goal lead.
[4871.60 - 4877.28] P:1918.90 E:0.107171 |  It's I mean Pedro drives across the box lays into Gerard Giroud's path and make the miles
[4877.52 - 4882.56] P:1867.02 E:0.111134 |  really has been quite naive really he's come in the back of him and put a shoulder into his back
[4882.56 - 4889.28] P:1839.90 E:0.112524 |  and unfortunately that's a straight decision and I'm just looking at the manager of Arsenal he knows.
[4889.28 - 4893.04] P:1850.81 E:0.108478 |  So this can probably settle it then with 25 minutes to go.
[4893.84 - 4903.12] P:1922.98 E:0.106461 |  Eden Azard in what could be his final game for Chelsea a penalty against Petricek in Baku
[4903.20 - 4906.08] P:1985.20 E:0.117881 |  and he sends it straight down the middle of scores.
[4906.96 - 4915.68] P:1980.81 E:0.116884 |  Chelsea three Arsenal nil if the Europa League trophy had handles they might well be putting
[4915.68 - 4926.32] P:2041.22 E:0.118259 |  the ribbon on them now. 3-0 in Baku Giroud, Pedro Azard and all the goals have come in the 20 minutes
[4926.32 - 4932.48] P:1980.56 E:0.116145 |  since half time. I mean Chelsea you've just gone up a gear I mean that's all you can say really
[4932.56 - 4936.56] P:2000.72 E:0.113517 |  but they might have even gone up two gears from where they were because this second half just
[4936.56 - 4942.16] P:1947.81 E:0.109537 |  been about them they've just been more clinical strong got faster they've moved the ball quicker
[4942.16 - 4948.32] P:1934.62 E:0.104870 |  and they're two offensive players Azard and Kovacic had a brilliant run there they've just
[4948.32 - 4953.76] P:1952.32 E:0.112019 |  gone and just drove at Arsenal's midfield. Maitland Miles you've got to feel for him young boy like
[4953.76 - 4959.68] P:1932.66 E:0.104433 |  that making that error that's a that's a costly error and now Arsenal made the two subs I've not
[4959.68 - 4966.00] P:2009.58 E:0.110375 |  seen who's gone did you see come up. Monreal has gone off, Gwendozzi has come into the midfield
[4966.00 - 4971.04] P:1935.20 E:0.103766 |  and Wobby's about to make his introduction they wanted to make this change before the third goal
[4971.04 - 4975.28] P:1927.28 E:0.095821 |  this smacks of the horse having bolted and people looking at the fence and wondering
[4975.28 - 4980.80] P:2073.53 E:0.104089 |  can we close the gate. Monreal was the first it goes off and now it's going to be Lucas Terera
[4981.36 - 4988.48] P:2073.62 E:0.100298 |  so two changes for Arsenal but they need three goals and in the mood that Chelsea are in it seems
[4988.48 - 4992.88] P:1967.57 E:0.100587 |  highly unlikely that they're going to get them what Arsenal need to ensure now is that this
[4992.88 - 4998.00] P:2080.11 E:0.106215 |  doesn't become embarrassing because 16 minutes are they get between those three goals from the
[4998.00 - 5003.60] P:1934.50 E:0.095619 |  moment Giroud scored with Pedros in the middle and then Azard's penalty and just like that in those
[5003.60 - 5011.04] P:1997.61 E:0.101147 |  16 minutes Arsenal's Europa League dream appears to have absolutely crumbled away from their grasp.
[5011.92 - 5016.24] P:1977.95 E:0.111613 |  You know one of Arsenal's problems was when they went one down they was chasing the game it
[5016.32 - 5020.08] P:1877.27 E:0.117034 |  didn't need to do that whether that's the naivety of some of the players in the group
[5021.12 - 5024.32] P:1955.64 E:0.108221 |  not been at this level before I don't know but Chelsea just picked them off
[5024.88 - 5029.60] P:1911.82 E:0.108270 |  and you know the free gold league probably flatters them slightly but that's what it is.
[5030.40 - 5036.56] P:1937.35 E:0.096226 |  So Arsenal back to a back four, Pedro in possession for Chelsea they're enjoying it now
[5036.56 - 5042.88] P:1900.45 E:0.091741 |  spraying the ball around a three goal cushion here and it's all turned so quickly against
[5042.88 - 5048.64] P:1934.60 E:0.097976 |  Tuna Emery a man who was hoping to win this competition for the fourth time but his Midas
[5048.64 - 5054.96] P:1916.65 E:0.094273 |  touch appears to have come up a little bit short. Nicola Cante challenging Guendouzi here.
[5054.96 - 5059.12] P:1898.32 E:0.094882 |  Guendouzi fresh onto the field as a substitute Arsenal in possession but they're back on the
[5059.12 - 5065.60] P:1852.28 E:0.098578 |  edge of their own penalty area. Yeah they've really got to sort of find a route back in somehow
[5065.60 - 5071.04] P:1831.97 E:0.109381 |  and that will help. And Wobby just skipping past as we were checking they always skip past.
[5071.60 - 5074.88] P:1836.77 E:0.112676 |  Wobby was not there by Christian Sinner, he's got to go in the book as well.
[5075.44 - 5080.32] P:1843.58 E:0.103013 |  That was a cheeky trip. Christian Sin knew he'd been bamboozled by the swing of the hips by Wobby.
[5080.32 - 5085.76] P:1784.71 E:0.100973 |  He raised his leg as a Wobby went over him and tripped him rather blatantly. Yellow card has been shown.
[5086.48 - 5091.76] P:1735.87 E:0.109092 |  Yeah so as we've got absolutely roasted there and that's what Arsenal need. They did that individual
[5091.76 - 5096.16] P:1821.01 E:0.103037 |  flair in between some of their good team play. Take someone on try and create something try and get
[5096.16 - 5100.64] P:1770.90 E:0.104976 |  back in this game. And there's a there's another set play which I think they've been poor at tonight
[5100.64 - 5106.16] P:1781.49 E:0.105990 |  Arsenal. That delivery was to go right in that area between the Chelsea back line and the goalie.
[5106.16 - 5110.56] P:1860.91 E:0.099883 |  Jack to take the free kick wide on the left. Swings at a left foot had better delivery this time
[5110.56 - 5114.40] P:1838.12 E:0.101360 |  but David Louise gets up and heads it away. It's going to fall here for...
[5116.24 - 5124.16] P:2023.49 E:0.113498 |  Obama young at the far side. Wobby! What about that? Just on the pitch! Drills in a half volley!
[5124.16 - 5132.08] P:2072.30 E:0.114672 |  Unstoppable for Kaper. Arsenal have got one back. They need two more but in this season of crazy
[5132.08 - 5140.56] P:2123.83 E:0.115966 |  comebacks they've got a quarter of the game remaining to try and worry Chelsea. Three one four goals
[5140.56 - 5146.24] P:1918.23 E:0.113262 |  all in this second half. There's a corner it gets cleared it comes to the edge of the box it sits up
[5146.24 - 5151.76] P:1943.91 E:0.120081 |  absolutely beautifully for him but he's still got a lot to do. He gets a great connection
[5151.76 - 5156.80] P:1787.50 E:0.114866 |  and actually calls it with the outside to be sported to that far post. That's a great goal.
[5156.80 - 5161.84] P:1848.01 E:0.113322 |  What a what a live for Arsenal that is as the game was running away from them they're right back in
[5161.84 - 5165.76] P:1792.67 E:0.120799 |  it and as we say with all of everything that's happened in Europe this week that will be in
[5165.76 - 5173.36] P:1958.71 E:0.121339 |  Chelsea's mind for sure. Three one four goals at 20 minutes. Sherwood, Petro and Azad for Chelsea.
[5173.36 - 5179.20] P:1866.06 E:0.100993 |  It will be trying to keep things interesting from an Arsenal point of view but if they could go and
[5179.20 - 5183.68] P:1813.46 E:0.100597 |  grab another one it will be interesting. Us for sure. Two goal deficit will feel a lot better to
[5183.68 - 5188.96] P:1809.00 E:0.099962 |  win iMRI's team than the three goals they were facing just a moment ago. By the way that Eden
[5188.96 - 5194.96] P:1826.18 E:0.099652 |  Azad penalty means that his tally for the season in all competitions moves to 20 goals. It's the
[5194.96 - 5200.72] P:1852.00 E:0.100032 |  first time he's ever reached 20 goals in a season for Chelsea. They may be about to lose him but
[5200.72 - 5205.28] P:1785.52 E:0.101795 |  it's been the highest scoring campaign of his career at the club. How are they going to replace
[5205.36 - 5211.92] P:1918.57 E:0.104545 |  those goals next season? Here is Inko Lokante halfway line. Chelsea preparing to bring on
[5211.92 - 5215.36] P:1838.86 E:0.106822 |  William. They want fresh legs. Sherwood's going to run here but I don't think he'll keep it in play.
[5215.36 - 5221.04] P:1931.19 E:0.104876 |  We'll eat no it goes out. It goes out for a corner corner to Chelsea who just want to calm things
[5221.04 - 5226.24] P:1850.75 E:0.099439 |  down now. They've got a three one lead. They want to make sure Arsenal don't make it any closer.
[5226.96 - 5231.28] P:1902.37 E:0.115996 |  Well you know when you're a manager and you're putting on substitutes you want an impact. You
[5231.28 - 5236.32] P:1945.29 E:0.110983 |  say to yourself come on you know give us the lift and my goodness Mia Wobbe has done that.
[5236.32 - 5240.56] P:1963.13 E:0.116919 |  He's done that great bit of skill and took two players on one the free kick and then from that
[5240.56 - 5245.44] P:1914.84 E:0.113425 |  result in there's a corner and then he's goes and smashes it in the corner. So brilliant for him
[5245.44 - 5250.24] P:2024.30 E:0.120413 |  but you know that goal just lifts so many players. I'm looking at Maile Lamarles. He looked like he
[5250.24 - 5254.56] P:2096.92 E:0.114551 |  was really suffering after giving that a penalty away and now he's got a little spring in his step
[5254.56 - 5258.96] P:1977.24 E:0.106888 |  again so it's such a lift and the game now is poised a little bit better.
[5259.68 - 5267.44] P:2026.70 E:0.105151 |  Corner taken short. Williams just come on. Rolls it to Azard and Gullochante with the cross.
[5267.44 - 5272.48] P:1893.69 E:0.096849 |  Header at the far post was by Olivier Giroud who feels that he was sure it was being held on to,
[5272.48 - 5277.44] P:1861.39 E:0.093004 |  that he was being fouled by Socrates but the referee says it's okay. Had play continues.
[5277.44 - 5282.80] P:1878.54 E:0.101351 |  William by the way came on in place of Pedro. Pedro who scores it in all English final again.
[5282.80 - 5287.76] P:1959.52 E:0.106786 |  Here they come. Chelsea into the piliers. Azard gets it back from Giroud scores.
[5288.88 - 5295.28] P:1992.73 E:0.117001 |  Four-one. What a second half it's been. It's Chelsea's night though once again.
[5296.00 - 5303.20] P:2112.99 E:0.120948 |  Four-one. Second goal of the evening for Azard. Arsenal's defense all over the place.
[5304.08 - 5308.88] P:1906.59 E:0.112581 |  Well they get themselves back in the game. They make another mistake on that right-hand side.
[5309.52 - 5315.28] P:1897.27 E:0.119666 |  Azard gets the turnover. Little run puts Giroud in and the Giroud's pass back is absolutely
[5315.28 - 5320.48] P:1920.67 E:0.117008 |  exquisite. Here we just showing the replay now. Azard drives it to the defense. Giroud just drifts
[5320.48 - 5326.64] P:1854.60 E:0.106775 |  left and then he thinks it over the centre half. Azard calls it a side-four. Four-one.
[5326.64 - 5330.48] P:1890.16 E:0.114118 |  Well they've pretty much averaged to call every five minutes since half time. What about this?
[5331.12 - 5337.92] P:1829.38 E:0.114410 |  Chelsea four. Arsenal won. It will be a score the best goal of the night but as things stand
[5338.00 - 5343.92] P:1856.94 E:0.112162 |  it's only going to be a scant consolation for an Arsenal team who've not really got their
[5343.92 - 5349.28] P:1866.20 E:0.099347 |  illustrious front through of Aubameyang and Lacazette into the match and their weak spot if you like.
[5349.28 - 5357.04] P:1831.26 E:0.094695 |  Their defense has looked uncertain, has left gaps and has allowed Chelsea to score for a fourth
[5357.04 - 5361.44] P:2086.29 E:0.111505 |  time now. It's just what I say the build up to the goal. About Pedro scoring in an all English
[5361.44 - 5367.60] P:1937.81 E:0.093953 |  final again. He scored in the Champions League final against Manchester United in the past as
[5367.60 - 5374.16] P:1794.87 E:0.097788 |  ball is played back to Socrates. Ten yards outside the Arsenal penalty. What do they do now?
[5374.16 - 5380.24] P:1860.40 E:0.099838 |  And just when they felt okay maybe just maybe with a chance at three-one four-one it must be
[5380.24 - 5385.76] P:1757.57 E:0.110340 |  so demoralised. And on a turnover as well they was in possession. I mean how ironic that Aydans
[5385.76 - 5392.08] P:1893.50 E:0.100064 |  now on a hat trick you know it was only ten minutes ago that he hadn't scored so it just goes to show
[5392.08 - 5397.36] P:1829.58 E:0.097124 |  you how the quickness game can change but Chelsea you know to say they got the hands on the
[5397.36 - 5403.28] P:1800.94 E:0.108126 |  trophy really and surely now and Arsenal very very difficult to find a route back when you
[5403.28 - 5410.56] P:1734.79 E:0.106597 |  can you score and give you that lift and then to concede straight away is a is a terrible blow for them.
[5410.56 - 5417.04] P:1846.03 E:0.106401 |  Five lives from the BBC and BBC Radio London tonight live in Baku the capital of Azerbaijan.
[5418.08 - 5423.28] P:1837.00 E:0.106177 |  And we've had five goals tonight in this Europa League final four of them for Chelsea
[5423.28 - 5428.96] P:1797.86 E:0.106306 |  who were on the verge of winning the Europa League for the second time. This Mendoza makes a very
[5428.96 - 5434.48] P:1858.42 E:0.103261 |  deliberate and obvious foul on the half-way line on Georginho and that is a free kick to Chelsea
[5435.12 - 5442.24] P:1821.96 E:0.101775 |  who are just completely in control now once again. I mean I find it strange that we haven't had
[5442.24 - 5446.96] P:1784.62 E:0.101346 |  more yellow cards. You know I'm looking at this game that's such an obvious yellow card that you
[5446.96 - 5451.44] P:1761.71 E:0.110736 |  would get in the Premier League and yet again it's I don't know if you just had the one book in two I
[5451.44 - 5457.84] P:1748.37 E:0.112596 |  think. Pedro and Christensen both Chelsea players but it's Chelsea on the verge of winning this
[5457.84 - 5464.48] P:1915.93 E:0.108125 |  Europa League final. Georginho back to Christensen all the way back to the goalkeeper once again.
[5464.48 - 5471.20] P:1847.25 E:0.102649 |  So first season in England for Mauricio Sarri he appears to be about to win a trophy for the
[5471.20 - 5476.56] P:1796.56 E:0.105559 |  first time in his managerial career and led Chelsea to third place in the Premier League
[5476.56 - 5480.80] P:1868.35 E:0.108619 |  when you consider the high standard achieved for the top two. There's no great shot, that's a
[5480.80 - 5486.16] P:1912.93 E:0.109342 |  lovely touch by Hazel the far side. Now into Olivier Giroud. Now the low shot saved away by Petitcek
[5487.04 - 5493.04] P:1837.35 E:0.103273 |  and Chelsea are going for it now. They want to humiliate Arsenal, they want five and most notably
[5493.04 - 5499.76] P:1834.97 E:0.106852 |  Eden Azard wants a hat trick. It's absolutely brilliant. He's you know he's tails up. Here comes
[5499.76 - 5505.52] P:1809.10 E:0.107679 |  Obamayang into the penalty area down the other end takes it wide around David Luiz and blazes it high
[5505.60 - 5511.92] P:1772.52 E:0.109108 |  up and over the crossbar. Sorry Adam. Obamayang has been poor this second half and those moments
[5511.92 - 5517.28] P:1811.93 E:0.103494 |  of quality but Eden nearly got his hat trick there. Great save from Petitcek. They needed Petitcek
[5517.28 - 5521.92] P:1775.07 E:0.108839 |  tonight. I mean you know he's made three or four fine saves and still finds himself four one down.
[5521.92 - 5526.08] P:1848.50 E:0.114808 |  You know he can't hardly believe it I should imagine but Chelsea have been terrific second
[5526.08 - 5531.44] P:1882.21 E:0.106582 |  half. I mean they've just been a level above. Yeah I think if you weren't in tune with this game,
[5531.44 - 5536.08] P:1867.97 E:0.104198 |  if you just saw the score line afterwards you'd think oh dear poor old Petitcek what a way to bow
[5536.08 - 5540.96] P:2061.35 E:0.110232 |  out and it is sad for him personally. It's not in any way beaten his fault. None of the goals you could
[5541.68 - 5546.72] P:2117.62 E:0.111763 |  point towards the the goalkeeper playing against his old team for making the mistake.
[5547.68 - 5553.20] P:1998.79 E:0.106197 |  There's a little change happening here. Ross Barclay is being introduced and he will come on
[5553.20 - 5558.08] P:1868.67 E:0.102057 |  in place of Kovačić. It's almost a joke amongst Chelsea fans so those two always seem to replace
[5558.08 - 5561.04] P:1797.96 E:0.106440 |  each other but the 12th appearance of this Europa League campaign.
[5561.84 - 5568.56] P:2029.42 E:0.114668 |  For Ross Barclay scored home and away against Malmo and he comes on. Fresh legs into the midfield
[5568.56 - 5575.76] P:1874.94 E:0.090771 |  for the last 15 minutes. It feels like the outcome of this final though is already decided.
[5575.76 - 5582.40] P:1829.75 E:0.099574 |  Chelsea four Arsenal one, Giorgio on the halfway line. No opponent within 10 yards or in any direction.
[5583.12 - 5589.84] P:1708.61 E:0.096912 |  Back out to the left hand side to Emerson. Now in Golokate who would look and appear is about to
[5589.84 - 5595.76] P:1785.32 E:0.103517 |  see out the full 90 minutes after all that talk about injury concerns. He's passed the ball forward.
[5595.76 - 5599.60] P:1895.33 E:0.102838 |  William was fouled and the Golokate sprints after it himself but I tell you he nearly gets there.
[5599.60 - 5603.84] P:1889.73 E:0.098775 |  I've always had this theory you know when he's fully fit there's actually two in Golokates.
[5603.84 - 5608.72] P:1874.12 E:0.095455 |  He makes his present felt so much on the pitch but on this occasion it's out for a goal kick
[5608.72 - 5614.32] P:1868.71 E:0.109142 |  and possession back. The guy can confirm that as the opposing manager. There's definitely two of him for sure.
[5614.32 - 5621.04] P:2075.29 E:0.110194 |  But he's been terrific second half and you know it's so ironic isn't it. We're all talking before the
[5621.04 - 5628.00] P:2046.58 E:0.109059 |  game about Sarri Fronis cap and you know Badfielder in Chelsea and his cantony, Fiat etc. etc.
[5628.00 - 5633.20] P:1978.87 E:0.114670 |  Well the scoreline 4-1. Just goes to show you you media boys you can't read anything into that.
[5633.20 - 5639.60] P:2009.54 E:0.110491 |  Sometimes some of its gloating daggers sometimes is put on for show you know and for sure.
[5639.60 - 5644.64] P:1899.46 E:0.105937 |  I don't think Kanti was anywhere in doubt from what I've seen of him tonight.
[5644.64 - 5649.84] P:1894.64 E:0.097021 |  Right another change for Arsenal. A very despondent looking mezzed Uzzel makes way
[5649.84 - 5655.20] P:1834.02 E:0.095910 |  and his teenager Joe Willick comes on. He's played a couple of times in the Premier League in recent
[5655.20 - 5661.76] P:1830.41 E:0.096613 |  months. Scored in the Europa League back in November. He is on some fresh legs down the
[5661.84 - 5665.20] P:1716.21 E:0.100503 |  left hand side of it up here. He's the left hand side of attack. Obamian on the right and
[5665.20 - 5672.32] P:1777.27 E:0.099964 |  Lacazette through the middle but Arsenal in need of a Baku miracle here with 12 minutes or so remaining
[5672.96 - 5681.92] P:1823.56 E:0.100239 |  in the game. Chelsea 4 Arsenal 1 Alex Obobi who came on as a sub at 3-0 down. You'd only been on the
[5681.92 - 5687.12] P:1868.76 E:0.099397 |  pitch for two minutes. Scored a brilliant goal and we thought here we go. Maybe just maybe game on
[5687.12 - 5694.72] P:1755.97 E:0.096602 |  but down the other end Chelsea came and that goal from Azard restores their three goal lead and
[5694.72 - 5700.96] P:1841.29 E:0.099990 |  the feeling of dominance that they've got in this game. Azard who scores two goals in the final
[5701.60 - 5706.24] P:1869.43 E:0.102494 |  of the European competition. He's the first player for an English club to score twice in
[5706.24 - 5711.04] P:1897.94 E:0.108756 |  UEFA competition final since Mark Hughes. Here comes Joe Willick into the penalty area
[5711.04 - 5715.84] P:1804.63 E:0.100497 |  twice to shoot good defending by David Louise. Makes the block in the penalty area and gets it away.
[5715.84 - 5721.36] P:1880.06 E:0.108481 |  Mark Hughes, Manchester United against Barcelona, 1991 Cop Winters Cup. Here comes Chelsea down the
[5721.36 - 5727.04] P:1963.99 E:0.101495 |  other end. William to the edge of the penalty area goes to Rakesh Ali. Shoot and save by Petticec.
[5727.04 - 5732.24] P:2006.61 E:0.104180 |  Well he's by far made the most saves of the two goalkeepers. He pushes that out for a Chelsea
[5732.24 - 5737.44] P:1824.54 E:0.104162 |  corner. I think Peter Czech will be looking at his back four here saying you know guys come on
[5737.44 - 5740.96] P:1763.21 E:0.109436 |  give me a bit of cover here. He's had to make another great save there. He must have made three.
[5740.96 - 5745.92] P:1843.81 E:0.098801 |  They switched off again here Arsenal. Chelsea are in. The corner is taken shortly.
[5745.92 - 5751.92] P:1860.16 E:0.093852 |  Willi and slips in the penalty area and that goes out for a goal kick to Arsenal. The clock ticks on
[5751.92 - 5756.72] P:1738.33 E:0.104751 |  just over 10 minutes of the regulation time to go. It feels highly unlikely we're going to have
[5756.72 - 5764.96] P:1865.27 E:0.105154 |  extra time and penalties now. Chelsea who have got the job done in the second half after withstanding
[5764.96 - 5771.36] P:1883.66 E:0.110305 |  a lot of pressure during the first period. But for all that pressure Arsenal didn't produce a shot
[5771.36 - 5775.52] P:1777.93 E:0.099183 |  and target. I think that will be the regret, the biggest regret for their supporters who've
[5775.52 - 5782.72] P:1877.65 E:0.098488 |  travelled here. This enormous journey. 5,000 miles return journey at Tupacou and their team
[5782.72 - 5787.36] P:1819.49 E:0.106952 |  toothless in front of goal and not able to trouble Chelsea at all in that regard. Here's Ross Barkley.
[5787.36 - 5791.60] P:1832.45 E:0.101868 |  Really nice touch from Hazard to find in. Hazard is hungry for that hat-trick.
[5791.60 - 5796.24] P:1879.29 E:0.109809 |  Willi and comes through the middle. Barkley again back to Willi and fresh legs.
[5796.24 - 5800.64] P:1924.46 E:0.109637 |  Sucrose comes running across. The shot is deflected and it goes out for a corner to
[5800.64 - 5804.88] P:1884.86 E:0.103192 |  Chelsea who are threatening to run away with this if they haven't indeed already.
[5805.52 - 5809.60] P:1776.12 E:0.115109 |  Well Barkley had two choices there. He had William down the run. He had Aydan Hazard
[5809.60 - 5813.76] P:1644.95 E:0.106703 |  from the hat-trick down the left hand side and he went to William and he does look to him as if
[5814.72 - 5822.24] P:1918.04 E:0.100171 |  he's saying come on. But you know Arsenal, the preview of this game was Arsenal's defence.
[5822.24 - 5825.60] P:1672.42 E:0.106179 |  Would it hold out? Would it be able to cope with Hazard? Unfortunately it hasn't.
[5826.80 - 5831.76] P:1871.52 E:0.102890 |  So it will appear no Champions League football for Arsenal next season.
[5832.64 - 5838.88] P:1709.62 E:0.099833 |  William takes the corner short to Aydan Hazard. Behind him is Aspelik-Quetta.
[5839.68 - 5844.40] P:1776.82 E:0.109900 |  And now Hazard wriggles his way into the penalty area. It gives it back to Aspelik-Quetta.
[5844.40 - 5851.68] P:1950.56 E:0.102229 |  The angle is tight but the shot was only a whisk away. That was so close to a fifth goal for Chelsea
[5851.68 - 5857.84] P:1805.80 E:0.104989 |  at this final. Aspelik-Quetta, I love that. I mean he's been Chelsea's outstanding defender for
[5857.84 - 5862.48] P:1777.01 E:0.109742 |  10 years or whatever it is. He's been brilliant and that would have really capped it off but
[5862.48 - 5866.64] P:1779.11 E:0.110489 |  Chelsea are absolutely dominant at the moment. Aspelik-Quetta who got his first score of the
[5866.64 - 5872.72] P:1722.36 E:0.104736 |  season not so long ago actually against Brighton. Here comes a Wobby for Arsenal. Surely it's done
[5872.72 - 5878.16] P:1802.14 E:0.098688 |  and dusted though. Gwendouzi in the midfield. When he looks back at his tactics tonight,
[5878.16 - 5883.68] P:1793.90 E:0.101878 |  Unai Emery, do you think you'll regret the three central defenders? Was that too negative or
[5883.68 - 5889.28] P:1827.23 E:0.103071 |  did he need that firm base given their defensive record? Well I thought the system worked well
[5889.28 - 5893.12] P:1838.93 E:0.103802 |  in the first half to be honest. I think it probably just had the upper hand. But when it
[5893.12 - 5899.44] P:1848.82 E:0.110747 |  came out second half, Sarri was a bit braver. The two wide players started doing their job
[5899.44 - 5904.88] P:1778.41 E:0.105182 |  for a bit more aggressive in the defensive work and they got turnovers and from then turnovers
[5904.88 - 5911.04] P:1855.35 E:0.105644 |  they've come the goals. But after the first goal, definitely Arsenal went down a level
[5911.04 - 5916.96] P:1726.68 E:0.108771 |  and Chelsea went up a level and that's how it stayed more or less the whole of the second half.
[5916.96 - 5921.36] P:1690.05 E:0.107212 |  Arsenal attacked down the right. Obamian Lash has won in and it goes for an Arsenal corner
[5922.32 - 5925.68] P:1609.01 E:0.117105 |  and in the turn our strain of little Gianfranco Zola who'll be savoring this
[5926.32 - 5931.76] P:1706.20 E:0.110139 |  means long association with Chelsea over the years. About to lift more silverware it would appear.
[5932.80 - 5936.96] P:1722.54 E:0.110154 |  Just over eight minutes to play a Wobby who's already scored once. This time he dinks it in.
[5936.96 - 5941.84] P:1882.36 E:0.109903 |  That's a clever ball and a chance to control and like I said, can't score and Obamian tries
[5941.84 - 5945.84] P:1959.40 E:0.112363 |  and he can't score either. And with the goalkeeper flailing all over the place,
[5945.84 - 5950.48] P:1884.71 E:0.103699 |  do you know what? It wouldn't have counted anyway. Flag was raised on the far side.
[5950.56 - 5954.48] P:1774.16 E:0.103958 |  Chelsea's defenders celebrate as if they've scored a goal themselves. Look down there,
[5954.48 - 5960.72] P:1788.42 E:0.099077 |  little pats at the bottom and high fives in the hall works and it's just not been Arsenal's night.
[5961.28 - 5966.16] P:1833.23 E:0.113830 |  Well, Chelsea come out there and four Arsenal players looked offside but ironically the player
[5966.16 - 5971.76] P:1829.47 E:0.107662 |  it fell to was onside. A brilliant save by Catherine and then on the rebound. Even though he was
[5971.76 - 5979.36] P:1805.54 E:0.107613 |  offside, Christensen got a great block in. Chelsea's defensive duties have been much,
[5979.36 - 5983.04] P:1672.16 E:0.111826 |  much better in this game than the Arsenal back four, five.
[5983.60 - 5991.52] P:1774.94 E:0.106516 |  Again, strong waft of the smell of oil that you get here in Azerbaijan. This Petrodollar State
[5992.64 - 5998.80] P:1737.85 E:0.107169 |  and very much the smell of the local industry and where all the money is coming from in the air
[5998.80 - 6004.40] P:1817.52 E:0.099940 |  as Chelsea come forward but an interception by Kishelny and a chance to clear away.
[6004.56 - 6009.36] P:1743.87 E:0.105321 |  Bamiyang is deep inside his own half of the moment. Now Granada Jack is still midway inside
[6009.36 - 6014.80] P:1817.60 E:0.099750 |  the Arsenal half and Chelsea just enjoying it now, jogging across, trying to keep
[6014.80 - 6019.12] P:1815.46 E:0.106252 |  times on Alex O'Wobe who comes over the halfway line, picks out Willock. Good play to give it to
[6019.12 - 6026.24] P:1918.80 E:0.112639 |  Lacazette. Back to Willock! Oh, so close! He puts it shot wide but that would have been a beauty for
[6026.24 - 6032.32] P:1822.30 E:0.102133 |  the teenager. How unlucky after O'Wobe and Lacazette aided him perfectly in the build-up.
[6033.28 - 6036.96] P:1791.64 E:0.110650 |  Well, they made the last eight minutes interesting as well. It was a brilliant
[6036.96 - 6043.44] P:1798.80 E:0.105397 |  play and now he's just trying to put too much on that. He hasn't got his foot quite round and
[6043.44 - 6047.36] P:1852.15 E:0.112150 |  he's just gone outside the far post but his play before them was absolutely brilliant.
[6048.00 - 6053.60] P:1850.51 E:0.120192 |  Both the subs have done terrific since they come on in the team that in the other nine
[6053.60 - 6058.72] P:1841.89 E:0.107901 |  areas have got their head down a little bit. Not just going to be made tomorrow. I'm sure there'll
[6058.72 - 6063.28] P:1759.42 E:0.101334 |  be pictures showing some empty seats at either end of this stadium. One thing to point out,
[6063.28 - 6068.32] P:1743.56 E:0.101477 |  if you look at the top of the very bottom tier here, I think a lot of supporters have left
[6068.32 - 6072.88] P:1741.11 E:0.095094 |  seats at either end because the concourse allows you to walk around and stand at the back and you
[6072.88 - 6077.12] P:1792.74 E:0.103583 |  get a halfway line view because behind the goal with the running track you're very far away. So
[6077.12 - 6082.32] P:1808.19 E:0.096956 |  although, you know, absolutely this isn't a completely sellout tonight, I think there's more
[6082.32 - 6087.20] P:1793.89 E:0.093334 |  people here than the empty seats revealed because there's thousands of them standing at the back
[6087.20 - 6091.28] P:1769.70 E:0.104566 |  of those tiers all the way along the side. Obviously we can't see the stand we're in but I'd
[6091.28 - 6098.40] P:1794.16 E:0.094582 |  imagine it's a similar aspect there. Arsenal not enjoying their night here for one down
[6098.40 - 6104.56] P:1819.24 E:0.101335 |  against Chelsea. This all London Europa League final very one-sided after a second half performance
[6104.56 - 6111.20] P:1828.05 E:0.100440 |  from Chelsea that has just blown Arsenal away. Here is a wobby left hand side. Chelsea pulling
[6111.20 - 6115.28] P:1802.18 E:0.106046 |  lots of defenders back deep. Hesitation by Jacque waiting for the challenge to come which
[6115.28 - 6119.76] P:1817.12 E:0.110301 |  does throw Olivier Giroud and the referee gives Arsenal a free kick at what? Oh for a moment I
[6119.76 - 6123.60] P:1844.76 E:0.106642 |  thought might have been a shooting position but actually the referee's taken a step or two further
[6123.60 - 6128.32] P:1832.93 E:0.109143 |  back from there to put his referee spray out and that those extra couple of yards have made this a
[6128.32 - 6134.80] P:1868.39 E:0.108145 |  very long range prospect if Arsenal decided they wanted a goal for goal but like I said Mike just
[6134.80 - 6142.40] P:1869.75 E:0.113216 |  be considering that desperate times lead to desperate measures. Yeah but you know it probably
[6142.48 - 6149.68] P:1837.60 E:0.112781 |  is in his range jest and that's about 28 yards 30 yards that's a hell of an effort. I will be
[6149.68 - 6156.00] P:1829.89 E:0.114769 |  worked too worried if I was the Chelsea manager in this situation but you know the goal now
[6156.88 - 6162.16] P:1795.25 E:0.120338 |  with the sort of history we've had in Europe this season. Like I said is the only Arsenal player
[6162.16 - 6166.80] P:1795.50 E:0.106279 |  standing over this there's no decoy runners there's a wall built in front of him like I said hits it
[6166.88 - 6173.36] P:1814.07 E:0.103815 |  but hits it high and wide he gave it a good lash but it's off target four minutes to play
[6173.36 - 6178.40] P:1665.03 E:0.104306 |  Chelsea for Arsenal one. And is that still there that would they have an under shot and target
[6178.40 - 6183.68] P:1633.83 E:0.113961 |  Arsenal because that wouldn't be something you want to walk away from a final with
[6184.24 - 6189.44] P:1689.31 E:0.114323 |  there's a stat against you. It hasn't cost them the game by the way the back defenders have but
[6190.24 - 6198.56] P:1715.19 E:0.114410 |  Chelsea for sure here seeing the time out now 86 minutes. And in those 86 minutes
[6199.12 - 6207.36] P:1739.34 E:0.101157 |  Arsenal have only had two attempts on target. Clear and spy Kepa up over the halfway line straight
[6207.36 - 6213.28] P:1719.83 E:0.102422 |  to Socrates who wins the header for Arsenal. Latelyn Niles still with energy in his legs comes over
[6213.28 - 6218.88] P:1714.24 E:0.102578 |  the halfway line right hand side Ross Barkley puts pressure on Obamiak. Arsenal hold on to possession
[6218.96 - 6225.28] P:1770.52 E:0.104492 |  Gwendozzi and to Granadjakka out to Obamiak on the left hand side that's really well done for
[6225.28 - 6230.56] P:1848.14 E:0.102163 |  Kalasadu tries to cross and blocked away by Christensen. Now you mentioned on the project that
[6230.56 - 6234.88] P:1828.13 E:0.101492 |  the substitutes have done well they really have done for Arsenal actually. Obamiak has been a
[6234.88 - 6239.60] P:1784.09 E:0.101023 |  live wire since coming on Gwendozzi has been full of running. Here is Obamiak tries to flick it back
[6239.60 - 6244.80] P:1782.33 E:0.103976 |  to Gwendozzi into the penalty area wants to try and control it harder said than done.
[6245.60 - 6250.00] P:1775.29 E:0.105697 |  Chelsea regain possession and they'll clear it away with Azard in that left full back position
[6250.00 - 6254.56] P:1733.37 E:0.106524 |  helped out by Emerson Gwendozzi battles out and wins it back again. He's fighting on for sure
[6254.56 - 6260.16] P:1837.27 E:0.102011 |  into the penalty area they come Arsenal but good work back there from Giorgio Gigno. Chelsea will
[6260.16 - 6264.24] P:1783.71 E:0.104437 |  come away with the ball and in the end with a Chelsea player down in Golochante plays another
[6264.24 - 6270.24] P:1890.65 E:0.103790 |  field so his team it can receive some treatment two and a half minutes to go. No doubt about it now
[6270.24 - 6277.04] P:1755.81 E:0.103622 |  Chelsea are about to win the Europa League. Yeah I'm fairly deserved mainly on the second half
[6277.04 - 6280.64] P:1897.93 E:0.115977 |  we've got a substitution now I'm not sure who's that's going to be as the Chelsea substitution.
[6280.64 - 6286.80] P:1894.63 E:0.109585 |  Azard's going off and Zapacosta is going to come on to stretch his legs right at the very end so
[6286.80 - 6293.76] P:1850.10 E:0.102897 |  there won't be a Europa League final. Hattrick, Frieden, Azard is this to be his last appearance
[6293.76 - 6298.48] P:2056.88 E:0.110613 |  for the club. Chelsea fans will certainly once they realise it's him going off they're going to give
[6299.04 - 6305.92] P:2037.35 E:0.108221 |  a standing ovation I'm sure. Tonight Eden Azard's 60th game of the season for club and country
[6306.48 - 6313.44] P:2006.82 E:0.109358 |  he brings his goal tally to 21 goals for Chelsea the most he's ever scored in a single season of the
[6313.44 - 6319.68] P:2005.93 E:0.106558 |  club. Well if it is a way to bow out it's not a bad one Alibarju. He could feel he's been a very
[6319.68 - 6324.48] P:1999.71 E:0.112626 |  good surfer for the club over the years. Absolutely he's been brilliant for Chelsea but in the second
[6324.48 - 6330.48] P:1945.76 E:0.109258 |  half today he was almost on player out there on that left hand side he's created and scored and
[6331.28 - 6336.32] P:1896.24 E:0.111362 |  his job is done and they'll be looking forward to you know getting hold of that trophy and
[6336.32 - 6341.36] P:1919.20 E:0.097660 |  fairly deserved too. Is that a difference between the two teams that that Chelsea have a standout
[6341.36 - 6346.24] P:1867.74 E:0.103601 |  performer whereas Arsenal there's no one individual who you would say yeah he's been their best player
[6346.24 - 6352.48] P:1751.36 E:0.097861 |  tonight. Well you know we've got a well cut winner in Ozu out there who didn't produce tonight
[6352.48 - 6357.68] P:1727.49 E:0.107891 |  nowhere near the level of Eden so you know they have got those players and they have got those
[6357.68 - 6365.20] P:1779.50 E:0.110293 |  players but defensively today own half breakdowns a bit of naivety here and there and the goals of
[6366.16 - 6371.20] P:1655.11 E:0.117456 |  hurt them too and that's why we stand at this small. Right all over Bar the shouting we're into
[6371.20 - 6377.68] P:1810.57 E:0.100264 |  the final minute of normal time a banner has been unfurled up midway through the enormous stand on
[6377.68 - 6383.84] P:1808.06 E:0.096389 |  the far side it's a message from Azerbaijan it says that we are all part of football thanks to
[6383.84 - 6388.96] P:1885.05 E:0.103460 |  UEFA for the final. They know that there's been doom and gloom about the the decision to have the
[6388.96 - 6393.28] P:1871.49 E:0.105234 |  final here particularly when two English clubs were drawn and they knew it's such a long arduous
[6393.28 - 6398.16] P:1818.35 E:0.100100 |  expensive journey they know there's been criticism of that and I think that banner is sort of saying
[6398.16 - 6402.24] P:1845.36 E:0.105965 |  well look we are all part of football it's not just the elite nations we're so thrilled to have
[6402.24 - 6407.12] P:1859.59 E:0.104789 |  hosted this final and they've got to see five goals as well as Willock attacks down the left hand

[6633.76 - 6640.96] P:1925.30 E:0.108539 |  cancelled Sherude and Pedro and two from Eden Azard in what might be his final appearance for the
[6640.96 - 6648.08] P:1890.14 E:0.116145 |  club and you've got to say in that second half Chelsea were really really good yeah they as a
[6648.08 - 6652.96] P:1981.24 E:0.120628 |  team they were they were just faster and quicker and part in the small crisp and of course with
[6652.96 - 6658.72] P:2010.47 E:0.113509 |  the outstanding individual on the pitch, Eden Azard he was terrific second half he was quite quiet
[6658.72 - 6663.52] P:2041.41 E:0.114605 |  actually in moments in the first but he really come alive in the second half and all those moments
[6663.52 - 6669.68] P:1984.72 E:0.110833 |  all those goals he was part of a great performance from Chelsea I thought Arsenal were good first half
[6669.68 - 6674.56] P:1805.60 E:0.116361 |  and unfortunately for them the game got away from them and their reaction to the goals would probably
[6674.56 - 6680.48] P:1874.41 E:0.112886 |  be a bigger concern than anything the goals went in quite easily at that that period and the game
[6680.48 - 6688.80] P:1921.69 E:0.112110 |  was gone but you know they still have a lot of great young players and a great manager and they'll
[6688.80 - 6694.64] P:2016.57 E:0.107974 |  come next year and hopefully be pushing for that Champions League place again. Joy for Olivia
[6694.64 - 6700.80] P:1946.79 E:0.101596 |  Sherude scoring against his old team the two goals from Azard will get headlines as well final

[6724.40 - 6730.64] P:2111.42 E:0.107145 |  be said in the last three seasons Premier League two seasons ago FA Cup last season under Conte and
[6730.64 - 6737.76] P:1997.34 E:0.096749 |  now under Surrey the Europa League and congratulations to Chelsea for a scintillating second half
[6737.76 - 6744.32] P:1737.28 E:0.082662 |  and Andy Townsend, Eran Hazard as we suspect he might turn the game and won it for Chelsea. Well he
[6744.32 - 6751.28] P:1603.44 E:0.089383 |  did as Alan Padu quite rightly said in commentary that second half they played at a different beat
[6751.28 - 6755.44] P:1533.17 E:0.096605 |  a different tempo to what they've been playing in the first half there was more energy about them
[6756.32 - 6760.24] P:1446.15 E:0.098555 |  what we saw from Arsenal in the first half we liked but ultimately that was pretty much all
[6760.24 - 6765.04] P:1713.34 E:0.087963 |  they had to offer and I just always had a gut feeling that first goal this evening if it went
[6765.04 - 6771.76] P:1779.26 E:0.085415 |  Chelsea's way Lee and I spoke about it half time I didn't see Arsenal somehow clawing their way back
[6771.76 - 6776.24] P:1804.16 E:0.088590 |  and and they were there were some good goals in there from a Chelsea point of view there was some
[6776.24 - 6781.92] P:1641.10 E:0.088997 |  sloppy casual defensive work as well from Arsenal in that respect the best team won on the night
[6782.80 - 6788.96] P:1670.54 E:0.089890 |  the key player stepped up and again fitting for Aiden Hazard that he should score a couple
[6788.96 - 6794.40] P:1809.30 E:0.101181 |  on what is probably his last game. Just looking at the monitors Chelsea's name is being engraved on
[6794.40 - 6802.48] P:1827.36 E:0.090502 |  the Europa League trophy a shot of Mesut Erzel sitting leaning back in the dugout not bothering to
[6802.48 - 6809.12] P:2002.05 E:0.092219 |  go out there on the pitch to either console his teammates or indeed congratulate the Chelsea players
[6809.12 - 6813.28] P:1687.84 E:0.098627 |  I'm going to turn to Lee Dixon before we lavish more praise on Chelsea because that has to be
[6813.28 - 6818.00] P:1798.62 E:0.102329 |  done this evening and Maurizio Sarri I mean after an extraordinary season that he has endured a first
[6818.00 - 6823.20] P:1952.03 E:0.100832 |  season in English football he leaves having helped Chelsea to third in the Premier League guaranteed
[6823.20 - 6829.28] P:1843.28 E:0.090550 |  Champions League football and the Europa League title but Lee from an Arsenal point of view what
[6829.28 - 6834.24] P:1766.75 E:0.097121 |  do you make of what you've just seen well I think Alan was right he played played well in the first
[6834.24 - 6839.68] P:1881.70 E:0.090074 |  off didn't have a shot on target that was one of the problems started to look like they were just
[6839.68 - 6844.80] P:1734.71 E:0.095408 |  giving a little Chelsea a little bit of space and then setting after we're blown away this team
[6844.80 - 6849.92] P:1767.25 E:0.091512 |  to be honest with you it needs to be playing well it needs things to be going its way when the
[6849.92 - 6855.28] P:1703.00 E:0.089975 |  things don't go its way it falls a little bit we saw that at the end of the season the character
[6855.28 - 6860.88] P:1643.61 E:0.093047 |  of the side the team spirit is talked about it's good it's this it's that I don't see that when
[6860.88 - 6865.36] P:1350.72 E:0.098122 |  they go down I really don't I think the fight isn't there the organisation are they getting
[6865.36 - 6870.00] P:1612.42 E:0.089439 |  everything from the manager are they understanding what he wants from them because they don't look
[6870.00 - 6874.48] P:1659.95 E:0.093252 |  any different to me without the ball than they did when he took over there's a little bit more
[6874.48 - 6880.16] P:1696.96 E:0.084723 |  organisation but the actual the press in the first half was decent so you go okay as soon as they go
[6880.16 - 6886.00] P:1587.37 E:0.080907 |  behind the defense the defensive mistakes they make the first goal was imperative that you get that
[6886.00 - 6891.76] P:1805.33 E:0.090650 |  goal in a final as Andy said Koshelny's mistake for the goals a brilliant header from Giroud really
[6891.76 - 6896.00] P:1813.76 E:0.087185 |  great cross brilliant header should not have a chance to make a header like that you've got three
[6896.00 - 6900.40] P:1836.03 E:0.095573 |  centre backs there's a centre half you've got to be in front of Giroud you know he wants to make a
[6900.40 - 6904.96] P:1739.80 E:0.092124 |  near post run it's his game that's you know your player know the player's going to make that run
[6904.96 - 6909.68] P:1671.93 E:0.091233 |  stand in front of him it gets bit you get beat over your head that's fine but the organisation
[6909.68 - 6915.76] P:1805.35 E:0.086858 |  defensively without the ball at times is knowing no better than it was before emory get there but
[6915.76 - 6920.88] P:1791.80 E:0.085798 |  huge recruitment problem they've got in the summer they need players have they got enough money will
[6920.88 - 6925.28] P:1745.09 E:0.084917 |  he get will he get enough money to sign those players major disappointment for the club tonight
[6925.84 - 6929.36] P:1973.36 E:0.100154 |  what do you make of mezzan urzel just chilling on the bench at this moment
[6929.36 - 6935.28] P:1812.51 E:0.083340 |  well all play but listen players deal with getting beat in different ways his performance
[6935.28 - 6939.20] P:1656.62 E:0.098169 |  i you know i look at these first doesn't look botheredly no it does not look bothered i look
[6939.20 - 6944.32] P:1824.15 E:0.092629 |  at his first half performance and alan said he did well and then in parts on the ball maybe he did
[6944.32 - 6949.76] P:1737.31 E:0.087100 |  i don't get i don't get what he brings to the side most of the time he steps up sometimes
[6949.76 - 6955.68] P:1814.77 E:0.078389 |  against the smaller clubs for a big world-class player that people keep talking about him i don't
[6955.68 - 6960.16] P:1530.60 E:0.091909 |  see enough of him and certainly in that second half went missing sat on the bench moaning to his
[6960.16 - 6963.44] P:1485.24 E:0.091647 |  players you know i shouldn't have been taken off or whatever he was saying i don't know what he's
[6963.44 - 6968.48] P:1807.55 E:0.078416 |  saying probably wronged me to speculate but i can pretty much guess what he was saying congratulations
[6968.48 - 6974.64] P:1761.80 E:0.098088 |  to marizio sarri a man who after years of impressing at nappley was recruited by chelsea into the
[6974.64 - 6981.60] P:1849.73 E:0.093104 |  english premier league but without a trophy or a title to his name he has just won his first trophy
[6981.60 - 6986.40] P:1855.82 E:0.085538 |  and let's not forget this after a season andy townsen in which he has gone public
[6986.40 - 6992.00] P:1954.79 E:0.094891 |  with his frustration at getting his messages through to his players he has withstood um
[6992.00 - 6998.32] P:1884.82 E:0.088250 |  players questioning his authority yep like keppa did in the in the league cup final and he has
[6998.32 - 7003.36] P:1916.33 E:0.089310 |  guided this team to third in the league to within a penalty shootout of winning that match and now
[7003.36 - 7009.92] P:1786.95 E:0.089540 |  the europea league how do you rate his impact his season has to be a success his season has to be
[7009.92 - 7015.12] P:1778.61 E:0.092532 |  viewed as a success it's had peaks and troughs i thought as i mentioned earlier it started well
[7015.12 - 7021.12] P:2022.65 E:0.099865 |  it then lost its way there was a lot of confusion around him and the direction that he appeared to
[7021.12 - 7027.04] P:2065.89 E:0.088724 |  be taking the team around christmas time they have gathered themselves he's weathered that storm he
[7027.04 - 7034.40] P:1991.28 E:0.084175 |  hasn't felt the love you know most chelsea managers when they go in there they they they get that and
[7034.40 - 7040.48] P:1811.17 E:0.094913 |  i think you've got it to start with and he hasn't really felt like he's he's admired by the by the
[7040.48 - 7046.40] P:1706.21 E:0.080811 |  chelsea fans and and and now i'd like to think i'd like to think those that have doubted him
[7046.40 - 7053.68] P:1625.27 E:0.079876 |  would come on and and and pay credit to his well his his his resilience because it's not been easy
[7053.68 - 7057.60] P:1372.59 E:0.091402 |  be very interested in here where he goes from here is he gonna come out make some statement after
[7057.60 - 7062.48] P:1388.38 E:0.087594 |  the game and say listen guys there's your trophy you wanted someone else you can have your wish i'm

[7071.52 - 7077.20] P:1319.36 E:0.084736 |  get rid of you and he will know that he will know that but uh but i think when you consider third
[7077.20 - 7082.16] P:1174.80 E:0.078221 |  place league cup final runners up and a europea league in your back pocket there's been worse

[7155.52 - 7162.32] P:1740.49 E:0.088558 |  a player probably the player of the abramovich era uh i mean he's had some good ones that's that's

[7175.84 - 7180.64] P:1178.08 E:0.087255 |  one area with azad when when you're talking about a galactico which he's probably going to become

[7193.12 - 7198.24] P:1810.96 E:0.087657 |  he's certainly capable of scoring regular mid 20s 30 a season i think he's that good and he should
[7198.24 - 7204.24] P:1546.70 E:0.092306 |  be scoring more goals and perhaps he has up to now our league's not so easy to get them but uh but
[7204.24 - 7208.88] P:1531.65 E:0.089564 |  but i think in aral madritcha he should be looking if he does happen he should be looking for 30 plus

[7233.04 - 7238.56] P:1855.43 E:0.115571 |  i think they speak for themselves those quotes um you know he's put in a great performance here
[7238.56 - 7243.28] P:1732.32 E:0.117925 |  you know as we said earlier if he moves on to real madrid then i think we'll all wish him well and
[7243.28 - 7247.76] P:1844.10 E:0.118992 |  good luck to be a big loss for the premier league because there's not many players who have the
[7247.76 - 7252.96] P:1868.63 E:0.124784 |  quality and the ability to to do the defense is what he's done tonight he has that drop of shoulder
[7253.28 - 7258.56] P:1793.09 E:0.118522 |  people underestimate how quick he is you can just once he gets level with you he just gets away from
[7258.56 - 7263.36] P:1749.21 E:0.120411 |  you and uh any ten towns and tell you he was not on particularly great mobile black midfield
[7263.36 - 7267.60] P:1744.18 E:0.119638 |  play like myself and that was the worst thing when they start running at your back for and you can't
[7267.60 - 7272.48] P:1856.00 E:0.117308 |  do nothing about it so you know he's uh he's a great talent and we're all going to miss him but

[7278.40 - 7282.40] P:1941.46 E:0.125752 |  the manager and the team uh they deserve the plaudits that are going to come their way just
[7282.40 - 7287.04] P:1790.98 E:0.117534 |  looking at social media though uh chelsea fans are intrigued by this additional line from asad
[7287.04 - 7292.32] P:1860.02 E:0.100377 |  where he says i'm just waiting for the clubs now what he means there we don't quite know but whether
[7292.32 - 7296.24] P:1848.17 E:0.102687 |  he's sort of like launching an auction or anything like that i mean we're all saying real madrid

[7302.24 - 7305.68] P:1875.14 E:0.086347 |  in the premier league that's the destination he wants i think the player wants and that's the
[7305.68 - 7309.12] P:1474.09 E:0.095971 |  destination he deserves and when he says he's waiting for the clubs he what he's saying is he's
[7309.12 - 7312.64] P:1782.16 E:0.090654 |  just waiting for the cubs to agree the number that's what he's waiting for they will have obviously
[7312.64 - 7317.76] P:1741.66 E:0.090587 |  been dialogue going on heavy serious dialogue up to now and now it's just the case of getting the
[7317.76 - 7322.88] P:1670.94 E:0.097150 |  number right he hasn't done himself any favors tonight by playing as well as he has he's probably
[7322.88 - 7330.08] P:1785.96 E:0.091743 |  just slung an extra few quid on that um on that fee but uh but let me tell you he's uh he's absolutely
[7330.08 - 7336.48] P:1747.20 E:0.089020 |  few heroes on his wages as well yeah he's absolutely everything that realm adrid need right now um but
[7336.48 - 7342.40] P:1927.77 E:0.102138 |  but for chelsea and the premier league it's uh it will be a sad loss because he uh he illuminates
[7342.40 - 7347.20] P:1972.23 E:0.095969 |  illuminates our game more often than not and uh we don't we don't want to see our best players going

[7357.52 - 7363.52] P:1861.11 E:0.095898 |  for for many of these players this is a crushing blow isn't it a crushing defeat and they will be
[7363.52 - 7368.72] P:1658.32 E:0.087314 |  thinking of their future as well and it won't quite be as appetizing as eddard hasard's future
[7369.28 - 7374.16] P:1984.83 E:0.116315 |  no the uh the future looks rather bleak for arson the moment this is a walk of shame for their players

[7719.12 - 7726.40] P:2103.49 E:0.113833 |  it's a weird scenario for for the for the ball that chelsea you know fans not really tip to him but
[7726.40 - 7731.76] P:2052.43 E:0.112609 |  he's delivered the trophy and they have this record of getting rid of managers after the one trophy so
[7731.76 - 7738.32] P:2217.72 E:0.116139 |  um it's still up in the air really i hope he stays because i think um he's just diligent
[7738.32 - 7745.12] P:2209.02 E:0.118687 |  so doing the job um of coming through some pretty low points in the in the season uh he's got his
[7745.12 - 7750.48] P:2172.47 E:0.120509 |  reward tonight and uh and he got it in style and there's nothing better than a final to win in style
[7750.48 - 7756.40] P:2007.37 E:0.105536 |  will this performance make him even more alluring to the likes of rail metroid the fact he can do it
[7756.40 - 7761.12] P:2029.69 E:0.102848 |  in the big finals like this 21 goals in a team that hasn't always been firing at old cylinders
[7761.20 - 7766.40] P:2061.89 E:0.095272 |  he's not an out and out striker it's a very impressive if he's in a team playing at a higher
[7766.40 - 7772.16] P:2123.35 E:0.096834 |  level than chelsea does he does his performance do you think rise to match that well i i don't
[7772.16 - 7777.44] P:2117.49 E:0.101865 |  think the level is that much greater at real Madrid but the opposition is less so he's goal
[7777.44 - 7782.08] P:2142.67 E:0.107867 |  tally for sure if he goes to the league he's going to go up that's why you can get 40 goals in the
[7782.08 - 7785.76] P:2041.29 E:0.119607 |  league you're just not going to get that in the premier league i don't can't remember the last
[7785.76 - 7791.52] P:2121.96 E:0.108277 |  player who got that kind of number so his numbers will go up and in those crucial games where he
[7791.52 - 7798.40] P:2081.66 E:0.109472 |  will be judged that real madrid is in this champions league in the big games against the Barcelona
[7798.40 - 7803.60] P:2062.77 E:0.111061 |  aphelic home adrid that's where his real judgment will come if he makes that move and a quick word
[7803.60 - 7808.72] P:2125.55 E:0.106413 |  on on unayemery who you know it feels such a moment of disappointment given though the situation
[7808.72 - 7813.12] P:2078.91 E:0.104445 |  he inherited i mean he's finished with more points than than our sybingers last season in charge
[7813.12 - 7818.96] P:2110.02 E:0.100030 |  he did get them to the final which is more than than arsail did last season at darsevega did has
[7818.96 - 7823.12] P:2065.49 E:0.110757 |  there been improvements from from arsail or do they find themselves back where they were a year ago
[7823.12 - 7829.20] P:2113.42 E:0.105703 |  now well i you know i the noise is coming out of arsail as what has league sort of commented on i
[7829.20 - 7836.00] P:2121.40 E:0.107790 |  think have been that the organization of the training ground the way they put the team together
[7836.00 - 7841.52] P:2013.49 E:0.115436 |  for the games has been better but they've got major weaknesses in that defense and i think only
[7841.52 - 7845.68] P:2045.74 E:0.114560 |  finance is going to change that with some new players i think they've got a lot of midfield
[7845.68 - 7850.72] P:2102.13 E:0.107491 |  players coming through so good batter young players and uh that that shows a good sign for
[7850.72 - 7855.36] P:2020.15 E:0.108453 |  the future but they really need to tighten that back that back group up all right well
[7855.36 - 7860.80] P:2077.17 E:0.106844 |  gentlemen the celebrations continue here jelsie about to go off in a lap of honor around the stadium
[7860.80 - 7866.32] P:2136.83 E:0.107177 |  displaying the gleaming silver where it's a wonderful cup is the europa league trophy it's the only
[7866.32 - 7871.36] P:2041.63 E:0.102409 |  way for cup that doesn't have handles on it and they are parading that around it's also the heaviest
[7871.36 - 7877.12] P:2138.82 E:0.106597 |  as well so sometimes you'll see two of them needing to hold it chelsea winning silver where again
[7877.12 - 7880.00] P:2160.64 E:0.091276 |  they beat arsail for one chelsea back up
