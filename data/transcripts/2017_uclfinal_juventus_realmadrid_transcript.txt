 Well Alan has been sitting with me now for over two hours. So she first went to Five Live tonight and I'm sure I speak for him as well as myself. I didn't want to leave my seat. I just wanted to try to kick off nearer. And now here we are, mere moments away. The Real fans who have been relatively quiet in opposition to the U-Vay supporters, they are flag waving at the moment. They are predominantly to our left. The event is supporters to our right. The stadium is full. Even the UEFA guests have taken their seats. Presumably they had a nice meal, Alan. And Alan's absolutely delighted because the music's now shifted off the pitch and we're now talking about football again. Yes please, please. Still three massive banners that have to be removed and then the material on which that performance went out of the way. That is the anthem. Does it make the hearse stand up with the fact that you're next? It doesn't mind. The teams emerge from the tunnel away on the far side of the field. Let out by the German referee tonight. A highly respected field streak. Appropriate a German referee in the final between Italy and Spain. And the two teams follow him out. From our perspective it's Real Madrid to the left and Juventus to the right. Real Madrid are quote the away team this evening. So they're going to be playing in a purple, or fair club, Real Madrid to our left at the moment by now. Juventus in their regular black and white striped shirts, white shorts, white socks. And the anthem is near its conclusion and then there'll be guests of honour. You can see the Champions League trophy itself set on the pedestal. It's a good 150-200 yards away from the rear setting. And the players I'm sure won't have touched the trophy in the way out. They'll probably have broken the rise as well. The job is yet to be done. And all these players started this competition back in September. Now in June there's been so much hard work put in by every single one of those players. They're managers, they just can't lead to get started now. They want to get out there, they want to touch that ball straight away. And we're ladies already. Just like the European Championship final. The final ambassador Ian Rush comes out carrying the Champions League trophy Rush. Who played for Juventus of course, played for Liverpool, was a winner. With Liverpool at this moment we welcome listeners to the BBC World Service. We're also joined tonight, I'm delighted to say, by Radio Wales. So we've got a huge audience hearing our five-live coverage. Rushy holds the trophy aloft and now takes it away. It won't emerge again until the conclusion to the final. And you still, we've got instinct Alan Shearer still in the cubing. Yes it is, simply because of how they've defended most games in this competition this year. They've been absolutely superb, so experienced at the back. With that back three we think it's going to be Kierlini, Bernucci and Barzagli. And of course with a huge experience behind them also of Gigi Buffon. So for that reason, that yes, I'm going to stick with Juventus. It should be a cracking game, some incredible players on show, both going forward and defensively, really really excited about this one. I mentioned Higuain's connection to Real Madrid. Also Kedira was in the Real side in 2014. He was at Real Madrid between 2010 and 2015. So he's got lots of pals on the other side and it was great when they came out to warm up. Alan, there were lots of genuine smiles and hugs for the players on the different sides. Yeah absolutely, that was great to see. It's what you call respect isn't it, is that you've played with guys over the years, you've played against them over the years and you know how much it means to them also. But I tell you what, once that whistle goes there's no friends out on that pitch. Well the con has been tossed after Buffon and Ramos exchange handshakes and hugs on the halfway line on the far side of the field. Now they pose for a photograph that they will treasure in years to come. Buffon dressed all in yellow tonight and the purple outfit of Sergio Ramos. Now let me give you the two line-ups in full. Starting with quote the haunting Juventus, the goalkeeper, is Yuzy Buffon. The back three is Barzagli, Bonucci and Chiellini. Then we've got Dani Alves, Kedira, Panjic and Sandro across midfield and then Di Bala, the Argentine just hanging back behind Manzukic and Higuain. Real Madrid's goalkeeper is Navas, they're back four, Carvajal, Ramos, Varan and Marcello. Then it's Cruz, Casimiro and Modric, then Isco, Benzema and Ronaldo. Vail came out to warm up of course, he was slightly late coming out. I don't know whether that was deliberate, he probably desperately wanted to start this game. I'm sure he will figure it. As we're underway and I make it nearly five minutes late, just before 10-8, certainly in my watch and it's Real Madrid, depending the goal, two are left in the first half and immediately the ball is out of play in this mid-seventh field for a throw in which is taken by Sandro for Juventus. The other scorer of the ball, hit back towards the halfway line and then it's headed on, Juventus on the attack here. It's with Higuain, Higuain, feet it towards the right hand side and as Dani Alves immediately challenged by Marcello, the ball squirts away into the centre circle. The first heavy challenge goes in, just showing you that the smiles are over. Time for the real game of football. Juventus in possession at the moment, play towards the left side and Sandro. Sandro is going across the ball towards the edge of the penalty area for Real Madrid. It's taken away by Modric, Modric is then tripped and it's a free kick to Real Madrid. If there's any question, Mark, about which system that Juventus were going to play then, Dani Alves has pushed right on that far right hand side and when Juventus were pushing forward there, he was giving them the width as they were expecting so as we expected, three at the back, Kealini Barzagli, and Benucci and Alves and Sandro left and right. Free kick taken by Madrid to Modric, Modric drives it long towards Benzema, Benzema jumped but he jumped into the defender and that's a free kick to Juventus. It will take a few minutes just to suffer down, it always does. Think about how good these players are, they're tense, there's so much at stake. Here they free kick is taken, now Sandro plays it in from the left hand side and it's pulled by Juventus into the Madrid half, now Modric collects for the holders of the trophy. Real Madrid, winners 11 times and they won all five of their Champions League finals. United hooked in by Marcello and over the line it goes to Isco, back to Marcello, on the far side of the field, Ronaldo's in the central position at the moment. Real breaking down the left side and then they run into that formidable Juventus defence, taking the ball off them and now it's time to play for Juventus throwing. He'll be a key man tonight as well, Modric, you mentioned him trying to get an early touch of the ball there, fantastic player. Should be a key player. Legri, very close to where his player is taking it through and on the far side of the field. Now Juventus inside the Madrid half, aggressive challenge there by Real Madrid. I think the Madrid player came off worse, the ball breaks to Juventus on this new side. It's with Sandro checking the ball onto the left foot, crossing the ball and then the header goal was, but it was comfortably saved by Navas, our position is very, very high up. We are actually almost at the parcel of the proportions that far away from the pitch, but here we go. Juventus on the attack again, the Madrid player had gone down injured, has got up again and seems to be OK. Another happy challenge on the far side of the field where it's won by Barzagli and fed in field. Now on by Hegué, Hegué runs forward, drives the shot in, Lo Navas spills it, but not really great harm, he punches on it before any other player can approach. Juventus having the better of this opening play here, passing the ball around with real intent in Hegué in there, had no other option but to go past the player and have that shot at goal from 20-25 yards out, give the keeper a problem. Juventus have settled rather more quickly than Real Madrid, he hasn't seen anything with Fischana Ronaldo so far. His time will come without doubt. Now it's Barra to Ramas, the Real Madrid captain. Ramas moves forward, clicks the ball to the left of Marcelo, Marcelo's just a yard short of the halfway line, looking optimistically towards Benzema, he is intercepted by Juventus, actually goes out and play off a Real player, it's going to be a Juventus throw about 8 yards short of the halfway line. On the far side of the field they're right in the first half. Juventus no, Real Madrid no, not just five live listeners here tonight, World Service listeners and Radio Wales, welcome to all of you wherever you may be, stop what you're doing and just concentrate on this huge game of football from the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. Sergio Ramas takes that ball down off his chest and then logs it towards the halfway line, towards Benzema, headed back by Juventus into Madrid territory, picked up by Modric, Modric clicks it to the right side and it's with Carvajal. Carvajal rushes over the halfway line, almost leaves his control of the ball, keeps it in play according to the system, near side of the field, he used a opponent that the ball had crossed the line but the assistant was in a great position to see and now it's still with Real Madrid, it's with Modric inside the centre circle, to the captain Ramas, on to Marcelo on the far side of the field, playing it down that left touch line, Ronaldo's around the edge of the D but the ball's not going his way, it's intercepted by Juventus, Juventus depending well at the moment and they win another thrown in the far side of the field. It's also noticeable when Madrid had the ball there, Pianist the number five, just giving that little bit of protection in front of that back three, in front of Benzema, in front of Ronaldo also. Here's Tanec again, Tanec, plays it forward, hoping for the return pass but it's not to him, instead it's to Bonici and Bonici, sweeps it towards the left side where it's headed on to Sandro, that was good work by Juventus, down the left line, taken up now by Divala, Divala playing it back to Panyac, on to the far side of the field, there's a cross in, into the penalty dangerous position, still in play on this near side, just to the left of the penalty area, crossed into the Real box once more. Here's a shot, jumping in by Panyac, great save by Navas, the first terrific save of the game, though the flag was up for offside, he still needed to make the save. Tell you what, he was absolutely brilliant player from Dani Alves down that right hand side, he whipped that ball in, they couldn't handle it and the ball comes back out to Pianist, what a magnificent save that is from Navas. One handed, strong, ball, never likely to get past him, but it was a shot accurately in target, they could have brought the first goal of the evening. And not only saving it Alvin, but actually pushing it away from the danger area. Yes, they could have pushed it out, he pushed it right. Excellent save by the Costa Rican goalkeeper who of course replaced the great Acre Casillas, who's not a forwarder. They look much, much, much sharper than Real Madrid at this moment in time there, one touch pass and then two touch, withen balls into the box and Madrid haven't got into it, Madrid haven't got into this game yet. Seven minutes gone, it's nil nil, but Juventus are the better side in the early moments of the game. Now there's a foul by Carvajal, free kick to Juventus. Carvajal hasn't retreated, still doesn't want to go back, Manzucic is there, Manzucic finally leaves it, Manzucic of course rather more important than the opposition half of the field. Instead it's going to be Chialini who takes it, Chialini coming forward, one of the three central defenders, just taps it short, takes the return pass, almost on the half way line, feeds it in field, then the header on, went to Sergio Ramos, Ramos clears it up, his crew feeds it on, but doesn't find a colleague and Juventus give it back, now they give it away again. It's Cruz to Marcello on the far side of the field, trying to get down that left flank, tackled and it must have hit Marcello last because it says free Juventus throwing. That was actually Eagween coming back, tackling Marcello there. Working so hard Juventus, but that's what we expected of them. They know that probably there are better individual players on the Real Madrid team, it's the collective ethic that we see from Juventus. That's what makes them such a threat to Real Madrid tonight, in their ambitions to retain the Champions League trophy. And then the coverage for Real, on to Ronaldo, Ronaldo falls over, thinks he was fouled, he wasn't fouled, glares at the referee and gets the Gs from the Juventus fans for trying to win the free kick. Which is Tanec inside the centre circle, laying it back to Benucchi, Benucchi hits it long, that could be a very accurate ball, Manzucchi comes up there, and he's got a little nudge in the back from the defender, that was quite clear of play, and it runs through the nervous. He just made that diagonal run didn't he Manzucchi, from the left hand side here, looking down there he made the diagonal run to the middle and the long ball, nearly caught Madrid out. Here's Casimiro with a powerful run forward, now taken up by Modric, Modric to the right side and Ronaldo. They're struggling to make an impact on the game, but that's a good ball to the edge of the penalty, then the tackle came quickly in and Juventus cleared the danger, she cleared it properly, almost gave it away again, that's good work by Juventus, coming out of defence. Manzucchi again. They're really on song, the Italian side at the moment. They look very, very sharp. And there was DiVala back, you know, 20 yards short of the half, where he landed. Great work by Juventus, sweeping past to the left side, but it's behind the intended target, and it's hard to play for a throw into Real Madrid, we played nearly 10 minutes. Juventus, no Real Madrid, no. You have far more options than Madrid at this moment in time, more players are wanting the ball, one, two touch, very, very quick. Varan to Ramos, and now Marcelo on the far side, on the halfway line, on to Benzema, back to Marcelo, and to his captain Sergio Ramos, and he just taps the ball 15 yards to his right, and it's fed on by Varan to Carvajal, Carvajal into Isco, Isco was foul tackle, and that's a free kick to Real Madrid, just a yard over the halfway line, no great rush to take it. Modric finally comes forward, plays it securely back to Varan, and now it's taken out by Cruz, who feeds it to the left side of Marcelo, right now they're running forward into the penalty, the ball, the pass, looking for him, again, he's tackled, again he looks around at the referee, as if he was fouled, and the referee could expect Sergio's head. He might look around, but he also has got a little smile there when he looks at the referee, never a penalty. But why not try it on Cristiano? Goal kick to Juventus, played short, and now they move it forward securely to the left side, and Chiellini, Chiellini, to Tanyich, who already looks a very important player to Juventus in these early moments, going into the tackle again, but Modric steps away from him, then Modric pass, wasn't great to Ronaldo, as is Ronaldo's way, glers back at Modric, as if he's why, couldn't have been better that pass. Well, Modric did very well actually winning the ball back, instead of going towards the ball Ronaldo, he actually ran the other way, and Modric played the ball short too, and of course, Juventus won it back straight away again. It's like you say Alan Shearer is alongside me in the comedy position tonight here in Cardiff, now Cruz has definitely held back there, and it's the first yellow card in the game. Wow, that's out to Gavala. Well, he definitely pulled Cruz back. He knew he got the wrong side of him, didn't he? Yep. A little tripler. Not sure it was necessary to take that yellow card. Still, it's early on in the game, the 12th minute of the match, three kicked around Madrid, string-seeing in this all-turple outfit. It's taken by Cruz to Modric, back to Cruz, into Casimira. Casimira is looking to the right flank, he plays it to the round first of all, Carvajal's over in the sneer side, taken up by Carvajal, the right fullback again, in now to Casimira, on to the far side in Cruz. Marcelo takes it up, and Marcelo crosses into the penalty, good control by Benzema, edge of the box, and then he feeds it forward. He must have used his hand, and it was well spotted by the German referee, three kicked in the end. That's what Real Madrid have to do, they have to get a feel of that football. Just pass it around as they did, they pinged them all up into there, into Benzema, he was on his own in the box, but look who's around him. He's unfortunate there, Benzema, because his first touch did control the ball, and then it knocked over the air, and he thought, use my arm, didn't get away with it. No. It's cracking now, this is a better spell for Real Madrid, and it's run forward by Isco, towards the far side, towards Benzema, Ronaldo now into the penalty, there's the cross, deep looking for Ronaldo, headed away by Pernucci, and brought under control on the far side of the field by Dani Alves. Alves runs forward, almost got himself into trouble, and then he does after being tackled, squirted all out of play, and it's a throw in to Real Madrid on the half way line. Nil Nile, you've entered some Real Madrid, 13 minutes gone in carded. Just starting to feel their way into the game a little bit better now, aren't any more players having the touch of the ball, and passing it around a lot better? Ronaldo, with jump-set of that challenge, gets the ball back successfully to Veran, and it's with Carvajal to right back into Modric, Modric and Panage, you can see already a key figure in the perspective midfield. Now Isco, back to the half way line in cruising, that's given away by Casimir, that was Carlos Juventus, taking up with Fugue, Casimir gets a challenge in, knocks the ball away to the right side, plays a 1-2 with Carvajal, and now it's back with Veran and Real Madrid in control of possession again. Sergio Ramos, onto Marcelo on the far side of the field, he left in this first half for Real Madrid, nice pass from Isco, and now Casimir again, Casimir looks at the right flank, and Carvajal, definitely on the game now Real Madrid, Carvajal trying to get past the defender, but Sandro is well holding him off, then it's taken up by Carvajal, but not without a legal use of some part of his body, it's a free kick to Juventus. I'm not necessarily thinking that's a foul, you know, Sandro's trying to let that ball out, he's got to run the ball out for a goal kick, it's got no pace on it whatsoever. Is anything Sandro pulls him? Forwarder, Carvajal has got every opportunity to try and get that ball, I didn't think that was a foul at all. So the free kick is just two yards in advance of the goal line to the left of the penalty area, both on it, hasn't had to make a save yet, plays it to Benuccio, Benuccio quickly hurls it towards for half, where he lying knocked back by Real Madrid, but again, I think they're free indicating a hand ball there by one of the Real players, I'm not sure who it was, or the foot was high from Casimir, that's what it was. So free kick, yet to be taken correctly, it's inside the centre-circle, still no-nil, Juventus and Real Madrid, Juve have only conceded three goals in the entire Champions League campaign this season. Now they cross the ball into the penalty area, the Real penalty area, knocked away to Modric, back by Casimir to Carvajal, and Carvajal looking further upfield, feeds it to Benzema, by Casimir, that's good work, finding Isco, Isco just in the right of the centre-circle, holds off two challenges, plays it back to Barat, that was applauded by the Real Madrid fans, and now it's Cruz, Cruz into Ronaldo, who's dropped deep to get involved in the possession, Cruz again into Isco, Isco tackled twice, but still keeps the ball in Real's possession, now it's looked towards the near side to Carvajal, back to Modric, Juventus have everybody back inside their own half at the moment, Cruz takes it up, the German, he's tackled, but the ball squirts conveniently for Real to Casimir, now Modric once more to the right of the centre-circle, playing it towards the left flank towards Marcelo, great control by the full back, he's actually a wing back really isn't he, plays it back and Modric collects it again, Modric to the right side now, and Carvajal 16.5 minutes gone, nil-nil here in Cardiff, listening on World Service, Iridio Wills and of course 5-Li, Marcelo on the far side, Marcelo taps it forward to Benzema, Ronaldo is alone, representing Real Madrid in the penalty, Marcelo might get the ball in now, he does play it in, but there are plenty of defenders back there, and one of them is back there, and the play for it forward. Much better from Real Madrid, stretching that Juventus back three, Carvajal on one side, and Marcelo on the other side, that side, and did very well to get behind the defender and get the ball into the box there, but again dealt with with Keolini kicking it away. Lot of quality out there, it's so obvious in the early stages, these are exceptional teams with exceptional players, even if we're yet to see the first goal in the game, who knows they might cancel each other out, no, the referee gives a free kick, a profile by Casimiro, Casimiro arguing with the Juve player, a challenger, OK, it was a foul, another yellow card challenge. It was noticeable, it wasn't that Juventus players went straight running to the referee to try and get a yellow card, because the ball had won five minutes earlier. Juventus free kick, driven deep from Manzuchic, Manzuchic trying to head the ball down to a colleague, either Higuain or DiBala, couldn't find either of them, it's Cleodogfield, Benzema gets away from his marker, plays it to the left side, Cristiano Ronaldo collects it, moving in towards there to the penalty, runs into a counter sack of Juventus players and loses possession. Superb player from Benzema, he turns Benuccio on the half-way line and played in Ronaldo, but it was Dani Alves running back from the half-way line to come in with a vital tackle there on Ronaldo. Four players though converged in Ronaldo, I mean he's obviously a source of danger, they know that. It's driven upfield now by Juventus, Higuain chases after it, the pass back to the goalkeeper Navas, and Navas hits the ball out of play, he's got the opening doors under pressure from the Uvee player. It was a long ball up wasn't it? Yeah, good one. Baran was quicker than Higuain going forward, but it was a poor ball back to the goalkeeper. There's the cross-ed in the penalty, a challenge on Juventus player, and then certainly in his deep there, Manzuchic being let's say ticked off by Sergio Ramos for going down, and the referee quickly between them, and basically saying if both players wise up I'll make the decision. It's noticeable though when Juventus get into those wide positions, not wasting any time whether it's Sandra on the left or whether it's Alves on the right-hand side, not wasting any time getting the ball into the box, getting it in there as early as possible, into Higuain or Manzuchic. It depends which way you look at it, what Manzuchic actually did there was clever, but it was also ugly. He sort of threw out his right leg to make contact with the Real defender, and then went down. That's what Ramos was complaining about. Juventus had the ball just to the right of the Real Madrid penalty, he might have got a free kick there, didn't do so, the referee's handling the game well. Here's Modric, Modric to Cruz on the far side, and Cruz runs away from his marker, he's beaten two players, feeds it forward, and now it's with Ronaldo. Ronaldo to the right of the D, taps it to the right, carb-out, back to Ronaldo, one down! What a goal! Such a simple goal by Cristiano Ronaldo playing the one-two. What a believable finish that was, a great ball in for carb-out on the right-hand side here. Ronaldo free in the box, no-one would in five yards of him, and he plants it into the right-hand side past Bufa, what a finish! It's his 11th Champions League goal of the season, it's only his 105th Champions League goal in total, and get this, it's the 500th goal that Real Madrid have scored in the Champions League era, and that's why they lead Juventus by a goal to nil. Superb, he's not there on the right-hand side there, carb-out running to get him behind him, he put Ronaldo plays him in, but he's drifted into the penalty area, some five or ten yards away from that penalty spot, he doesn't even look up, he knows where the goal is, and it's a superb finish. So controlled. The old keepers got absolutely no chance. Zidane applauds, Ronaldo takes the applause, his familiar stance afterwards, legs at Kimbo, looking at his fans, he's delivered yet again. They move the ball with such pace into Benzema, back to Ronaldo, into Carvajal the right-hand side, and it was too quick for Juventus, we said in the first 15 or 20 minutes at the number of bodies the Juventus players get around the ball when being attacked, not on this occasion, because they moved the ball too quick. Let's see how Juventus respond, here's Higuain, the former Real Madrid player, tackled a losing possession, it's forward to Benzema, Benzema tries to flick the ball backwards to Cruz, Cruz couldn't collect that, Juventus picking up again, half-way inside the Real Madrid half, Juventus no, Real Madrid won, Ronaldo in the 20th minute of the final here in Cardiff, and now it's on the left side with Sandro for Juventus, Sandro plays it back to Kedira, and instead on lots of Juventus players inside the Real Madrid half, but of course we also know that if Real push a lot of players forward, Real can counter attack with Menace, it's back with Benucci, Benucci's over the half-way line, you really say that about Benucci, Benucci plays it towards the left side, and Sandro again, onto his right foot, the cross is probably too long, no it's not, Esco, headed it away from the danger, picked up by Dani Alves, Dani Alves tried to sweep the cross in the early, it hits Esco, and it's out for a throw in the Juventus, taken by Dani Alves, ball goes back to the Brazilian once more, then he almost ran into trouble, Panyac collects it just on the edge of the tender, great work by the Bosnian, into the box, tried to shoot it, goal too many defenders back for Real Madrid, one of them blocks it, and it's taken away by the side that had just taken the lead, and now there's a free kick for a foul on Cruz by Benucci, free kick to Real Madrid. Panyac did very well getting forward there, very much like Juventus did to the Real Madrid players, but there was either way around here, they had four or five players around him in the box trying to get as much space, he just couldn't get his shot away. Benucci got the slightest of touches on that Ronaldo shot, but you know, it's Ronaldo's goal, and as you said Alan, you picked it out immediately, he wasn't even looking, he didn't have to look, such was his sense of the geography of the penalty area. The goals never move and centre forwards know where they are, and he played Carver Highland, but his movement just to pull out a little bit was sublime. Here he is again, and he tried to get past the defender, and he wasn't blocked, though he shaped when he ran past the defender as if he had been blocked, hoping for a free kick, wasn't given, and Juventus had possession again with Sandro, Sandro feeds it in field. Now Kedira onto Panic, Panic just ahead of the centre circle, looking to the right side, and he was being directed by Barzagli there to play it to the right towards Danny Elves, now it comes back into Panic once more, Kedira, Juventus with everybody barred, Buffon over the half where he line, and on the attack, down the left flank, good control by Sandro, ostensibly the left wing back, Sandro plays it back, Kedira onto his right foot, into Panic, Panic spins away from the player marking, plays it to Sandro, giving him room for the cross, shrugged into the penalty area, glancing header on, and Isco, Marcello rather with a dodgy header away, brilliantly kept him played by Juventus in the far side of the field, determined that keeping the ball in play was better than throwing. Now, where are they going to attack, how are they going to pierce Real Madrid, who for the moment are happy just to lead players back and counterattack. Well for ten minutes in this game you met Juventus, had all the ball, Real Madrid couldn't get near the ball, they had two or three good ever goals, and Navas was doing well to keep them out, but then slowly but surely Madrid started to feel their way into the game, their passing became a lot better, a lot quicker, and the way they hit them on the break, Juventus for the goal, was superb. Good throw by Navas, the Real Madrid goalkeeper to Carvajal, who plays it back to Verran, and Verran the Frenchman, knocks it forward, Casimiro, Casimiro seeps it towards the far side, but it's intercepted now by Danialgo, Danialgo is running forward, Juventus with plenty of players around the penalty, oh that pass needed to be slightly better in the Real Madrid counterattack with Modric, over the half way line, and suddenly now it's five against four, Modric going forward, plays it into Esco, Esco, almost ran over the ball and lost control of it, and Juventus bring it forward again, it's wide open at the moment, ball played to the left side, and Kedira, Kedira steps onto his right foot, crosses into the penalty, the chest had passed down, balls inside the tee, shot driven in by Higuain, but it headed offender and rebounds now to Modric. The game is so open now isn't it? Stomachingly so. So much space around. Cruz plays it towards the near side, intercepted by the head of Chiellini, and back down to Sander, onto Chiellini, when do you see him in the opposition half? But Real Madrid lead by a goal to Nel. An excellent start, Juventus with a better side, but that real goal was so impressive by Cristiano Ronaldo, his 41st of the season and this is his 46th game. He's playing. Here's Sander, just pulling the ball into the penalty here, played back. Manzukic to the overhead, what a goal, what a fantastic equalised goal by Manzukic. My word, what a finish, that is from Manzukic, the ball actually falls to two or three yards inside the Indian Yard Box with his back to goal, got no option but to try the overhead kick, he tried it and it floats in over now, that's the keepers got no chance. What a terrible game, what's the doubt really, I mean a very different goal to Ronaldo's, but equally impressive. That was one hell of a finish that was, he didn't have no option around him, he just had to do that, look the ball comes to him, back to goal, what a strike that is, he catches it so sweet. Such impudence, do you even attempt the shot at goal, the bollied goal, but he hooked it over Navas, and that's sensational, and it's one-one in what already is looking to be a great Champions League final. It's not disappointing is it? You didn't want to stay at home, it's worth a drive. What a game this is, what a game. Right, I was just getting a buffon's reaction in replay as well, I think he was slightly pleased as well, as he looked towards the Yvette de Sphand behind his goal in the first half, well two exceptional goals. I'm amazed there's so much space, I'm amazed that the players have got time to take the ball down, you attack us then we'll attack you, it's incredible, it's a great game to watch. That's only four goals that Yvette has had to see in the Champions League this season, Real Madrid have scored in every match they played in. That's how good these sides are. Here's Sandro, Sandro forward to the left of the Real Madrid penalty, Sandro passes the ball into the box, good, he's quite an attacking instrument, isn't he? And that is their first thought as I said, as soon as they get into that last third, the Yvette has players left side or right side, left side this time with Sandro again, their first thought is get the ball into the box into Igüeyen, they've been successful for them. Casimiro plays the ball to the Real Madrid right side in Carvajal, back it goes to Madrid, Casimiro kicks it up again inside the centre circle. And now Ramos, the Real skiffer, under Marcelo on the far side of the field, Ramos available again on the half way line, and he drives it towards the right side, what a great ball to Carvajal, Carvajal controls it, now he's tackled by Sandro and it's out of play, I don't think Carvajal enjoyed that challenge, looks to the assistant, but he takes the throw in anyway, back to Modric, Modric crosses low towards the edge of the penalty, towards Benzema, Benzema didn't quite get the control he wanted to have and Yvette is bringing it away to safety on the far side of the field. Great work, aggressive challenge that was by Sergio Ramos, if he might have thought about taking it to the tackle of the baller. There's a lovely battle going on down there with Alex and Carvajal, Alex the left side in play, Yvette is Carvajal right side for Real Madrid here, every opportunity, one's attacking, the other one's attacking, it's a great battle to watch. Nobody's smiling at opponents now, we love it. Thank you for listening, not only to five lives tonight but to World Service and to Radio Wales, I hope you're not disappointed, Yvette has won Real Madrid one half an hour that is blown by. So we've got a free kick to Yvette, on this near side of the field, Sandro will take it, well the Uwe fans may have been disheartened, particularly by the quality of Ronaldo's finish, they've put Real Madrid in front but now their team is level again, the ball fell forward towards Higuain, intercepted by Varan and that's worked well by Real Madrid, they were slow in the opening minutes but they've certainly woken up now on the far side of the field, it's with Benzema, Benzema comes in from the left, the ball goes to Marcelo, Marcelo skips past a defender, Marcelo turns the ball onto his right foot, not crossing it yet, gives it back to Isco, Isco crosses in towards Benzema, only half, Ronaldo with the overhead kick, trying to do a manzukic and that one didn't go into the net. They're all fashion now, these overhead kicks. Well do you remember Emery Shans goal, what flipped you down, manzukic's strike was the equal of Shans, it's a terrific match, now Sergio Ramos had just been booked and that's ominous for him, a player who's only been sent off 22 times in his career. Is that all? Just 20, I mean he does get into a bit of bother, great defender but there was a tackle on Dani Alves and perhaps it was because it came so quickly after the challenge at the ball. Yeah that was why it was given, it was definitely a foul but you're absolutely right, it was just soon after that foul. So free kick to Juventus, inside the centre circle, I think Allegri and Zidane and the France had it. It would be surprising if they covered the Rhymes, there's so much happening out there. Juventus from the free kick, played the ball deep inside, Madrid half and then there's a foul, that was by Pinochet and it's a free kick to Real Madrid. Isn't it a cracking game? You can take a little breather now, can't we? It doesn't happen, it doesn't happen. But it's great, you know you give this Champions League final every year as I do, the big build up and then it, nine times in a turn it delivers because of the quality of the teams, the quality of the players and the atmosphere is just fantastic. It is, it's just a magnificent game of football and a great arena. Cruz de Marcello, Marcello feeds it to Esco, Esco got away from his defender, crosses the ball into the defender, towards Vendor, Ronaldo had a free head of it, headed it wide of goal, he didn't even head it behind for a goal kick, that was an opportunity for Cristiano Ronaldo to score his second of the night. An excellent ball in from the left hand side from Esco. Here's Esco again, feeding it to Benzema, Esco certainly justifying the fact that he started the game ahead of Garret Vale. Hopefully we'll see Vale later. Now Ronaldo is tackle, once more he glers at the referee, thinking he was scored, he wasn't. And Sandro takes it forward, Sandro towards the half way line. And Sandro then just checks, feeds it into Tanyich, on it goes and it's going towards the right side now for Juventus. Taken up, fed in field by Devala, Devala plays a 1-2, it's working well. He runs forward, was he broad time? Certainly Juventus thought so, Real Madrid don't think so, but it is a free kick to Juventus. I think he just had overran the ball, you know, and Modric was just there, his touch was pretty poor. Look, couldn't do nothing about it, I don't think Modric, but the referee gave the foul. He ran into Modric really. Just a minute before that, you know, it was a superb ball in from the left hand side from Esco. Benzema went ahead of the ball and Ronaldo was free at the far post, dive and header, he didn't even hit the target. Twelve minutes left in an electrifying first half here in Cardiff. Juventus won, Real Madrid won, now the free kick is within shooting range. Except, well, about 30 yards from goal, maybe a tad more, but here's Tanyich, who is shaping up as if he's going to shoot it goal. Now, as to where, here's Tanyich, or maybe not Tanyich, no, it's fading again, they're appealing for handball, but the referee didn't see that. Juventus still in possession though, and it's stayed down there left side, that's going to be hard to keep in play, and I'm not sure he did keep it in play, you know, he didn't, Benuccio who'd been up for that free kick, so it's a throw in to Real Madrid on this near side of the field. Well, we're expecting Pianist to hit that one, but the ball had just stood up there, and the ball goes towards him, he puts his arms in front of his face to block it out, and it does hit his arms there. Yeah, it's not as if his arms are by his side, you can say well he made no attempt to play the ball with his hand, his hands were far too high. And you can always tell by the reaction of the eventist players how serious the shot was. Real 1-1, a great game of football here in Cardiff, and now we're going to get another free kick to Juventus, that was a challenge coming in by Benzema. Ouch, yep. Just caught Pianist with his elbow there didn't he? Yep, 11 kisses with 4 kickoffs. I told you there wouldn't be any friends out there on the pitch when the ball kicked off. You can tell there's respect the way the teams are set up. They know the dangers inherent in both things. So this is way beyond shooting distance. So up from the back we've got Kealini and Bozagli. It's sure Bonucci's up there as well. Pianist is going to take this free kick. It's a long way out, given the angle, about 50 yards. Here he goes, right foot is swarming it into the penalty here, headed away by Sergio Ramas. And then Danny Alves went to meet that ball, decided he didn't like the challenge that was inherent on Ronaldo, and now it's out of play, up on the outfield in the far side of the cellar, it's going to be a throw in to Juventus. Nine minutes to half time on five live the World Service on Radio Wales. Excellent defending from Ramas there when that ball was whipped in. 1v1v Kealini, it was whipped in with pace and Ramas had to get all his head on it. It's hardly a loose pass. It's a very, very high standard of football. Here's Sandro, Sandro getting past this goal, now he's going to be tackled. Oh and the ball break behind, I think, who roughly has given a corner. I thought that hit Sandro last. That was wrong, that wasn't a corner. I think it hit the back of his heel last. We're just getting a replay. It wasn't even close actually. But you know, unless we're looking at monitors on the sidelines and whispering is here, no goal kick. Am I cynical seeing the referee might realise he's made a mistake and give a free kick? No you're not, you're absolutely right. But we'll see, it's an eventous corner from this near side there left, hooked into the penalty. And there was a header goal, but immediately the referee is seen and caught foul challenge by Kealini. What a surprise, eh? Well, he's trying to even things out. There you go, and we're just getting a replay of that fantastic goal by Manzucic. Wonderful overhead strike on the volley, brilliant. Great ability, technique superb. There's a winner with Bar and Munich, and now wants to be a winner with Juventus. One goal each, seven and a half minutes to half time. We don't want the half time whistle the way this game is going. Balls be heard at play. Manzucic is just down injured there. So Juventus had the ball and Kealini just kicked it out for a throw in so you can get his treatment. I must say this is as near as I get to exercise, Alan, because what we've got here is you've got a really good monitor in front of us. But it does obscure a certain part of the picture of me, so I'm sort of bouncing up and down. I just thought you were excited, Alan, I thought it was excitement. That as well, but it's really good for me. They're not losing Manzucic, and Carvajal just checking that Manzucic is OK. It's a spray that will ease the pain and then he'll rejoin the fray. So two exceptional goals. Can you pick between them, which is the better goal? The Real Madrid goal, Ronaldo goal, was so quick in possession, the way they hit Juventus on the break, the way they stretched them. But as an individual goal, the Manzucic won. The technique, because it wasn't really on for him, there was nothing on for him. So for him to even attempt that, some 15 or 16 yards out on the angle, which is great ability. Well, do you know something, we're just going to replay the Manzucic goal again. And behind the goal to the left, because Ned, he found, that's where the Real Madrid fans were. You could pick out Real Madrid fans applauding. It must have been good then. They respected the technique of Manzucic, and he spit again to resume play. Juventus have the ball on the far side of the field. It's on the halfway line. Ben and Thiel is a foul tackle. Juventus now have a free kick. Manzucic, he's hobbling just a little bit. But we'll see. I think Real Madrid should be very careful about Sando doing this left side of the Juventus attack. Because he was instrumental in his volley cross into the penalty area that led to the Manzucic goal. Might be coming his way now. No, it's hooked on towards Higuain inside the D of the penalty area. Knocked out a play by Sergio Ramos for a throw into Juventus, which Sandra will take. Five minutes to go to half time on five live the World Service in Radio Wales. One goal each here in Cardiff. Good throw into the penalty area. Poor marking up by Real. Shot driven in. Head for Rahn, and now Isco hooks it high into the air. Still dropping too close to the danger area, as far as Real Madrid are concerned. But now Marcelo has it, and they need to get it clear. Ramos clears it. Paws the right side towards Isco, and the ball's out. I think that's a lot of Sando. It's off Isco, and it's going to be a throw into Juventus. Juventus were pushing in there, and the ball went into the box from a long throw in. But they lost the ball, but the impressive thing about them was they went after them. They chased after that ball in that final third, and they weren't going to let Real Madrid pass it out. They're working very, very hard, Juventus. Ball's back with Buffon. The replay showing after the Juventus equaliser. What an ugly face he has when he gets excited. It wasn't a smile on his face. It was an expression of attack. It was great. What a leader he is. What a game this is. One goal each. Alan Shearer alongside me here in Cardiff. Carvajal takes it out. Then he's tackled. It's Manzukic who made the challenge. Manzukic scored the equalising goal. Runs away. Carvajal brings him down. I think the referee was waiting to see if there was any advantage, but it might even be a yellow card for Carvajal. It is. So that's a second defender for Real Madrid who's received a yellow card. And it was right because Manzukic is working ever so hard to go and retrieve the ball. He gets the ball, and he's just getting away from Carvajal. Carvajal went for the ball, but he did catch him from behind. Correct decision with the yellow card. Probably an unnecessary challenge because Casibiro was facing up. Two Manzukic, just a couple of yards away. Two defenders in the back four of Real Madrid who have been booked the cross into the penalty area of Real Madrid by Sandro. Only half cleared. Dani Alves on the far side of the field. Faced by fellow Brazilian Marcelo Marcello. He's out, I think it's a far tackle by Dani Alves, and it's a free kick to Real Madrid. Sandro is having an excellent game down the left-hand side. He's given his team wit there. As I said at every opportunity, he's not wasting any time in getting that ball into the box. Well, he's only won six caps for Brazil so far. I can see many more in the pipeline for Sandro. I can't believe who's playing left-back for Brazil at the moment. Must be a hell of a player. Here's Veran now after that Real Madrid free kick. Two and a half minutes left to the interval. One goal each between Juventus and Real Madrid here in the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. Veran must find Marcello on the far side of the field. Dani Alves facing up. The pass goes forward to Ronaldo. Ronaldo back to Cruz, into Casibiro inside the centre-circle. On to Isco on the far side of the field. Isco's running along the half-way line at the moment. Nezha from Modric. On to Cruz. Marcello's two is left. Ronaldo, ominously, is in the D of the Juventus penalty here. Cruz, good ball for the right side in Carvajal. Carvajal's faster remember set up. Ronaldo for the goal that put Real Madrid in front. Now it's back to Modric. To the far side and Isco once more. Just a little left of the penalty here. Dejan Marcello into Modric. Lovely tap by Modric. It's a Cruz. Cruz now to the right side again. Real Madrid pressing. Carvajal crosses into the penalty. A deep back comes Buffon. He's got the ball securely. That's easy for a goalkeeper of his standard. If you're not going to put the ball in with pace, if you're going to lift it in like that, then it's got to be exceptional. Otherwise Buffon will come and collect it as he did then. Buffon, dressed all in yellow. There's obviously a number tonight. Navas all in green. Buffon hits the clearance over the half-way line. Into Real's possession. Cruz unhappy with the challenge made on him. There was really no need to hold up play there. He ordered a free kick. I thought the advantage was already with Real Madrid. Now Marcello on the far side. Marcello turns back to the half-way line. Plays into Veran. Veran almost did Veran into trouble. Veran controlled it well. Now Carvajal the right fullback. Back to Veran. Veran, fix it. To his left, backwards. To Ramos onto Cruz. Isco, Isco now. Evades two Juventus challenges. Featured back to Veran. And now Modric, Modric on the right side. Isco's near by. Modric keeps the ball though. Plays it to Ramos. Ramos onto Cruz. We're inside the final minute of a wonderful first half. We will have time added on. There have been a couple of stoppages. Now Modric to the right side at Isco. Benjamin's waiting in the penalty here. So does Ronaldo. It's back though. And then that's a shot driven in, but it's wide of goal by Castamira. And it's behind for the goal. He had the option to shoot there, but he also had the option if he had to pick his head up and look just to his left hand side there. Marcello was in a great position. Just on the touch line. Given his team a lot of width, he chose the wrong option. We've got two minutes of added time at the end of the first half. Juventus won. Real Madrid won. Real took the lead through Ronaldo in the 20th minute. Then Manzukic equalised in the 27th. The ball's inside the centre circle. Great work by Isco to find Benzema. And Benzema eludes Dani Alves. Flicks it towards the left hand side. Back it goes to Cruz. Cruz to Marcello. Ronaldo's on that far flank. Marcello cuts in field. Plays it to Cruz. No room for a shot. He finds Isco though. Isco shoots. It rebounds off at a fender. Rebounds to Modric. In added time at the end of the first half. Now Carvajal to Isco. Isco inside right channel. Rules of all onto his right foot. The pass was errant though. Didn't find Carvajal. Intercepted by Juventus. And now it's played back into the Juventus penalty area. But they're cool. They know what they're doing. And it's played away towards the near side of the field. Where it's had to play for a throw into Real Madrid. Good pressure from Real Madrid in the last few seconds of this half here. But every single Juventus player in their own half. Doing their own shift. Doing their work for the team. After the throw in Marcelo on the far side. Real Madrid left. And it goes to Ronaldo. Back to Cruz. And now Modric with a little bit of room inside right channel. Modric sprints forward. He's still running forward. I think the defender is going to make a challenge. He does and evolves out of play for throwing to Real Madrid. 30 seconds left of added time. He's throwing very close to the corner fly. Being left by Modric for Carvajal to take. Isco's nearby. Carvajal. Perhaps thinking can I reach Benzema. It's thrown towards Benzema. Clever defending by Penicillus. Sort of barred Benzema away from that throw in. And it's cleared by Juventus towards the half way line. Verandas Sergio Ramos. And to Marcelo on the far side. They're left full-bite. Marcelo. Flicks it off. His fellow countryman Danny Alves. He's out for a throw in. And we've had our two minutes of added time. And the referee has blown for half time. And what a first half Alan Cherry. Incredible entertainment. Come start to finish. Juventus had the better of the first open in 10 or 15 minutes. Then Real Madrid came back into the game with a hell of a finish from that man Ronaldo. But the way Juventus responded and came back into the game. Didn't panic. Didn't push that much forward. And it was just a sublime finish from Manzuch. Didn't have no other option. Overhead kick. Top of the net. Goalkeeper no chance. What a game. What a good spell from Juventus. Then Real. Then Juventus. Then Real. Then Juventus again. Just brilliant entertainment. It just flown by that. What was it? 47 minutes we played. It's incredible. Great to be here. It's a pleasure to be in Carlos tonight. And at half time, it's Juventus won. Real Madrid won. Yeah, I almost fell asleep in the first half. I had this pin beside me to troll myself to keep me awake at times. No. It's great. It really is great. I just hope, you know, we've had three yellow cards developed for Juventus. Carvajal and Ramos for Real Madrid. I hope we don't have a red card tonight. An exceptional game of football. No changes at half time. Juventus line up. Goalkeeper Bufon. Back three. Barzagli, Burici, Kealini. Then Dani Alves, Kedira, Panic and Sandro. Then developed behind Manzuch. And Huigüain. Real Madrid's keep playing. Huigüain. Real Madrid's keeper is Navas. They're back for Carvajal. Ramos, Varan and Marcello. Then Cruz Casimiro and Modric. And finally Isco, Benzema and Ronaldo. Ronaldo put Real in front. Manzuch equalised for Juventus. Two exceptional goals and an exceptional first half. Real Madrid. All in purple. Juventus in their black and white striped shirts, white shorts and white socks. Juventus defending me into our left. The challenge area occupied by this man Bufon. He might be put under pressure in the second half early on. Ronaldo feeds the ball back. But it's headed away, curfewy away by Kealini. And cleared by Juventus. Await the danger area. Can we have more of the same please? Yeah please. Please. No more scrappy football in the first half. Just eradicate all the sloppy passes. How many sloppy passes were there? Not that many. A handful. At most. Juventus had the ball with the excellent Sandro on the far side of the field. His volley. That was so curfewy then teed up by Higuain from Manzuchich. Not to be forgotten about in that exceptional Manzuchich equalising goal. He's going to take a throw in now on the far side of the field. We're getting close up of Garret Bale. We must be wondering because Isco is playing well Alan, you know Will Dale get to come on here in Cardiff in his home city. That must be his hope. Nothing against Isco of course. Real Madrid in possession inside their own half and there was a trip tackle by Kedira, the former Real Madrid player and it's a free kick to the Spanish side. It's not a bad option to look at the benches and having Garret Bale if you're chasing the game is something special. Indeed. Free kick is taken short and now Baran on to the far side takes the return pass. Benches captain to his left, Sergio Ramos and on now to 20 crews, the German. Crews to Marcelo and Marcelo chips it for Isco running into the penalty angle's very good. What a great tackle coming in. That's twice that ball in the half now. One, the first time was in for Ronaldo behind Barzagli and this time another similar ball in behind and Barzagli just got back showed great pace to get back in there. Getting chicken out of the challenge because if he got it wrong it was going to be a penalty kick. Perfectly timed. It is a corner though to Real Madrid. Crews to take it from this near side, playing it right, put it in from the left, almost a free header, goodness comes back off of another Juventus player now the referee seems something amiss and has given a free kick to Juventus. It was a magnificent ball in from the right. Three. Crews wasn't it? Curled in with a little bit of pace there for one split second then I thought when they was coming together I thought it was going to land in the back of the net the ball. Verran was up there trying to nudge it golewards but certainly outside the plate of the ball there must have been a push. Not really all that easy to see it anyway. What's wrong now? Juventus player has gone down and he's indicating is that Vinicius? He must have got a smack in the face and he's got problems with his vision. That's what he was saying to it wasn't it? Being from that set piece there coming together and crashing heads So now he's receiving attention Vinicius but if he's got double vision then he's got a real problem here. That was the first thing he indicated wasn't it? Straight away when he sat down bit of double vision. And because it's a head injury a question of rushing him off the pitch no chance of that happening he's just enquiring if he'll be alright to carry on four minutes gone in the second half he's certainly got a smack in the nose because there's some blood coming out from his nose a little replay of that corner we're seeing. I think it was the ball hitting him in the face rather than someone with an elbow so it shouldn't be too bad. Vinicius coming to the sideline for the moment but a player like him will get back on the pitch the second he can just clutching his forehead there but I'm sure the event of staff he'll be capable of resuming the game has resumed and the ball's inside the Real Madrid half just watching Vinicius arms are off now he wants to get the attention of the referee to get back on the pitch he's just been signalled back on now Juventus had the ball on the far side of the field this could be a possession while they were down to 10 men playing it back to their captain and goalkeeper Buffon Buffon without hesitation rather plays it to the near side I know it's driven long for Juventus Higuain is after it, Higuain controls it Higuain and then gives it away to Cruz Cruz now to Marcello Marcello on to Isco halfway inside the Juventus half back to Marcello what impudence plays the ball through the legs of the Juventus player to find a colleague quite deliberately and then Ronaldo loses possession Marcello wins it again but his header went through Juventus player and it's hooked away Marcello's going to get involved again and then he deliberately ran into the Juventus player trying to coach a free kick from the German referee he didn't get so and now it's Juventus who's run forward another Juventus player was down injured and they've got to be careful here Juventus are they going to just smack the ball out of play yep there it goes I didn't see if there was a foul challenge there I've got to admit just a little bit untidy the Isco was the man at fault this time it's Dani Alves who was challenged for getting a replay of the incident now Alves running for no Marcello the Brazilian stood on the foot of the Brazilian Dani Alves quite deliberately he's very fortunate there you know because if the referee sees that then it's a yellow card now they embrace but no Marcello's an ori boy and it's a throwing to Real Madrid indicated by the referee well I don't know if Dani Alves knew what Marcello did do but he'll see it later you won't thank him later that's for sure no he certainly won't so it's just a little bit not scruffy's a wrong word but stop start the start of this second half already we've played seven minutes it remains here the world's service and Bridia Wills one goal each and now the referee is going to book Cruz that was for a late challenge on Kedira it's getting a bit naughty out there yes that's three yellow cards for Real Madrid again that was a step by Cruz I think that was look really bad look as well doesn't he just at the last second see where he was so the fourth yellow card of the evening three of them to Real Madrid the ball is back with the event of goalkeeper Buffon Buffon hits it over the half way line where it's headed on by Manzukic towards the far side of the field Sandro gets the better of his opponent Sandro approaching the left edge of the penalty here looking for the challenge the challenge was made and now it's head of play but what's the referee given all the Real Madrid players are going after the referee again looking for yellow cards doesn't help a final act I mean not Modric knew exactly what he was doing there he was saying go on challenge me I'm going to go down and then I'll get a free kick he was waiting for the contact that's the polite way of putting it okay, cheating's in other way here's Isco after the Real Madrid free kick Isco suddenly surrounded by Juventus Perc, he keeps it in Real's possession, Casimir feeds it towards the right side and now it's cutting now by Carvajal to Marcello, one full back to the other Marcello to the left of the Juventus penalty here back it goes to Benzema taking it again Modric shot too close to Buffon to trouble a goalkeeper at his class good effort with his left foot Modric had no option but to hit it 22-23 yards out but that wasn't going to trouble Buffon, straight at him no, he gets his hands behind, he gets his whole body behind it good strike though, yes it was good effort in the 10th minute of the second half Juventus won Real Madrid one and the final of the Champions League here in Cardiff and it's been a fantastic atmosphere and so far a fantastic game here's Isco, Isco beats two players Isco goes down, again he's looking for a free kick, doesn't get it and it's taken forward by Chiellini Chiellini stabs the ball to his left side and immediately thinks I'm a central defender I'm not going much further forward than this so he stops his run forward but it's still with Dani Alves still with Juventus and now Higurian is tackle, loses the ball and Cruz comes forward evades that challenge Cruz plays it to the left side to Ronaldo, inside left channel onto Isco, Isco approaching the edge of the penalty area Ronaldo is in the box waiting for the cross it's played back but it wasn't going in Ronaldo's direction only half period, Marcelo picked it up, Marcelo shoots high and wide, goal kick Higurian's got to do better there for Juventus the ball's played up to him, he's the target man he's got a holder, he was a little bit weak then the ball bounced off him which gave the opportunity to Ramos to bring the ball forward, pass it forward and Isco down the left hand side pulls a little ball back and isco was dangerous from round with mid but Higurian's got to do better, he's got to keep hold of the ball actually was a far challenge on Isco but it's getting a bit difficult for the referee because the players on both sides are being more than a little naughty anyway, Juventus have the ball with Higuain on the near side of the field Higuain tackle, keeps possession Higuain close to the corner flag tries to sweep the cross and I'm sure it's across the goal line it has and it's a goal kick good defending from Higuain, he knows that Higuain's not really going anyway he's got him where he wants him on the byline and he's got no option there but to put it in behind for a goal kick it's only warming up the gas bail is limbering on the far side of the field and I'm thinking whether it's encouragement from Zidane or whether it's Vail trying to save Zidane I'm here and available but it's getting a bit difficult for the referee Juventus have possession but lose it rather easily and it's clear towards the near side towards Ronaldo, headed away by Barzagli rightly identified by Alan Shearer before the game started is the man most likely to pick up Ronaldo I don't know, has he a kick aimed at Benzema by Dani Alves don't make the referee job any more difficult guys, now Modric to the far side of the field instrumental in Ronaldo's goal for Real Madrid now it comes down to the left side and it's with Isco Isco brings the ball under control feeds it into Modric, Modric is about 35 yards from goal though Modric running forward and then he chips it towards the left side but he can't find Marcello, that should be cleared comfortably by Juventus, by Barzagli not a great clearance Modric collects it Marcello wants more Marcello shapes to go on the inside back on the inside and plays it back to Modric Modric to Casimiro Casimiro feeds it towards the far side of the field and now it's Varan, up on the attack Varan into the penalty, almost squeaked the ball back the cross back towards Benzema but it's intercepted by Juventus and should be cleared by Juventus and then it's given away, that was careless, sloppy we were spoiling the first half with so many good passes and good passage of play it's been a bit sloppy hasn't it Marcello leaves it for Marcello Marcello shoots it and draws the far post Ronaldo was there, but the defender did brilliantly I think just to put him off I think it was Sandro wasn't it who whips the ball in there Marcello and Ronaldo was just lurking at the far post there he didn't really have to make contact with the ball Sandro, he just had to put his body just to be there in front of Ronaldo, just to stop him there clever defending, good defending well done Sandro, he had a brilliant first half and Juventus won Real Madrid 1 Real Madrid getting on top here Esco, Esco shoots wide he was leaning back and didn't make the top of contact at all and Ronaldo's given him a filthy look there you know because Ronaldo was just out to his left hand side there he had the option to play Ronaldo in but he chose to go with the shot it's high wide it is a habit that Cristiano Ronaldo has you know I mean I know he's a brilliant player but sometimes he sort of snarls at a colleague can't be good at the ball it's his hunger and desire to have the ball that's the important thing I think that he wants the ball all the time and he gets angry when people don't give him it both had a play on the far side of the field and they will be a throw in to Real Madrid a leg reek, very animated in the technical area feeling his side had just lost their impetus but mind you they started the game so well when Real Madrid didn't look like a threat free kick to Real Madrid just over the half-way line for a challenge on his scope Marcelo's going to take it it's just two yards inside the event is half he taps it back to Cruz and Cruz to Varan Modric available and it goes to the creation the experts player Modric leaves it and it's tapped back now still in Real's possession Cruz and it goes to Ronaldo Ronaldo plays it back to the half-way line quickly goes forward to Marcelo Marcelo moves in field away from Dani Elves and now it's back to Modric Modric 25 yards from goal I think half thought about a shot at goal then then he got two acutes so it's a cross instead from the right side by Carvajal the clearance by Juventus straight into Real Madrid's possession again Sergio Ramos and in Isco the pass in field was intercepted by Juventus Juventus can counter attack here that was a loose ball in field and Modric takes it up for Real Madrid once more definitely the better team after the arm-arc here in the second half the ball played to Benzema Benzema into the penalty area Benzema back Cruz with a half-parted shot cleared by Juventus the shot dribbin in Castamere has put Real Madrid in front I didn't think that would be both of them but it beat him to his right it nestled in the net and it's back to Real Madrid being in front Juventus run Real Madrid 2 it's another magnificent straight but I think you'll find it hits one of the defenders and takes a wicked deflection in front of Buffon he takes the opportunity what is he 25 yards out, not a lot else on head down hits it as hard as he can and it flies into the corner with a wicked deflection I think it's a good play now and no sooner than that the initial shot was by Cruz and that Castamere well it did take an deflection I think off-isco his own player we'll see, no first time was the event is good and that took it wide at Buffon off-Cadira just sends Buffon the other way by the time it takes the deflection he's got to get back to his right-hand side he sees it late no chance, right in the corner little bit of luck there decent strike but a wicked deflection right, Real held on to their lead in the first half for just 7 minutes they've been the better team in the second half they started the second half like Juventus did in the first half they've had a lot of possession they're the team that's pushing forward looking to get balls into the box much better from Real Madrid this half let's see if Juventus can respond the second time well, for fun unfortunately the deflection was critical Juventus have it now on the far side of the field with Sandro, it's quickly fed in Tanej plays the ball into the Real Madrid Tenal to H cleared by Real but the flag was already up for off-side, free kick to Real Madrid there's a lovely ball in from Pjanic on the right-hand side and Daniel Bez has just made that diagonal run into the 18-yard box just missed Tanej's run and correctly given off-side he could do it the back of his heel one of those things one of those things Madrid fans celebrate anticipating a 12th triumph in the European Cup Champions League era and poised to become the only team in the Champions League era to have retained the trophy the last team to win two successive European Cups, AC Milan in 1989 and 1990 that was some side, this is some side Real Madrid but Juventus are good and Juventus came back for being a goal down in the first half they haven't played as well in the second period no question about that throwing to Real Madrid, Marcelo they're taking Marcelo throws it to Isco back to Modric and Modric looking to the far side towards Carvajal, decides that Carvajal was being too closely marked, so plays it to the left instead Sergio Ramos to Cruz Cruising to the score of the second goal Casimiro, Casimiro's loose ball forward, headed clear by Juventus Juventus give away possession again and it's Modric to the right of the penalty throws the ball back by Naldo, makes it 3-1 what a finish, what a run incredible ball in from Modric from the right hand side and Ronaldo darts into the near post and it's a cute, clever finish Buffon, no chance he floats into the area no one sees him, no one picks him up it's brilliant finish the second goal of the night for Cristiano Ronaldo but it came from an error in Juventus defence giving the ball away, when they weren't under particular problems there's a great ball in from Modric great ball, and he just knew I think he sensed that Ronaldo was making the run to the near post very sloppy from Juventus, giving the ball away in the first place, but what a ball what a running behind from Modric he whips it in and Ronaldo floats into the near post, no one's near him no one picks him up, you can't give him that amount of space, 3-4 yards out the pass to Modric was actually a little bit heavy he times it to perfection the run, the ball in is great yes, but the run is exceptional what a finish we've got 25 minutes left for play, Juventus won Real Madrid 3 is that the critical winning goal scored by Ronaldo remember he scored the winning penalty last year against Atlético Madrid Pianich and Kedira have to get nearer to Modric and to Cruz, they're controlling this game at the minute in that midfield dominating possession they've got to get closer to them Xandro, crossing the ball into the Real Madrid penalty you sense that you've got to get the ball back very quickly here it's cleared well by Real Madrid and those are far long crews, definitely it's a free kick and now they just need to get total grip defensively as well, Real Madrid there's hadn't been many times where that back 4 or back 3 have been criticised this season because they've been magnificent but on that occasion they were caught standing still they just let Ronaldo float into the area and didn't pick him up at all he's too clever for them, too quick for them and too sharp and it's one hell of a finish again Talic has just been booked and there's a change there for Juventus and but Zagli is off and Cudrado is on Danny Alves will just come into the right back position and Quadrado as he has just come on to that right hand side of midfield where Danny Alves was playing for most of the game well they have to do something different and Allegri has responded immediately Cudrado on and Juventus have gone to a back 4 now Real Madrid in possession and the far side of the field a push and that's going to be a kicking off for Talic he just booked free kick to Real Madrid they've got to get the grips with the midfield because still Modric in there is seeing far far too much with the ball, Cruces, Casemiro is dominating the midfield in there Well they're still denying the contribution of Cristiano Ronaldo you know two goals tonight both of them very well taken but Modric has had a terrific match Modric has been superb he's controlled it in there, he's passing he's controlled the pace of the game in there a good tack on Higuain and then Juventus jump in again the ball back on the far side of the field it's hit long looking to the right side I think the whistle has already been blown the flag is up for offside halfway through the second half Real Madrid lead Juventus by three goals to one Juve fans looking very concerned you're listening to Five Live the World Service and Radio Wales on the BBC thank you for listening tonight I will be very surprised that you've been disappointed it's been a great game of football Ronaldo wins the ball back inside his own half it's played forward to Casemiro his goal came between the two efforts by Ronaldo now on the far side of the field it's Carvajal into Ronaldo once more he leaves it for Isco Isco turns back the purple shirts certainly dominant Sergio Ramos the cruise on this left hand side and it goes to Isco again the return pass to Cruz wasn't great but the Juventus clearance runs straight to Varan and Varan knows he's got Sergio Ramos to his left he plays it in the captain and now to Cruz Cruz into Casemiro complete control now Real Madrid ball driven towards the right side Carvajal brings it under control Ronaldo goes across third to support him Ronaldo picks it up approaching the penalty area goes outside to the penalty area to the right side tries to cross I think he pulled the ball behind there's so much confidence now on the every single Real Madrid player is wanting the ball demanding the ball and showing so much skill when they get it is that 42 for the season now for Ronaldo? Yeah it's terrible 42 and 46 games and it's 106 Champions League goals that's 12 ahead of Messi and that's his worst season goals wise for how long? 7 seasons? is it some of the 8 seasons? I'd get rid of it I mean, Huddersfield I really love Huddersfield by the way but I think Huddersfield is a good chance to win I think it's a good chance to get him and don't Huddersfield fans misunderstand fantastic that you won promotion absolutely fantastic you got a great manager looking forward to being at your grind next season balls out of play on this near side of the field it's going to be a throw in to Juventus after Cudrado was tackled here's Cudrado again after the throw in into Panic Fijic could right Panic immediately held his left leg could be an injury problem for the Bosnian he's definitely struggling but it's fed towards the far side of the field Juventus with plenty of players forward they've got it on the edge of the penalty it's with Sandro Sandro though with his back to goal and Sandro then dives in on Varan follows the player and it's a free kick to Real Madrid they just need a spark from somewhere Juventus they need one of their players to get back into the game or Dubala or Cudrado who's just come on there just to give them a little bit of energy to give them a little bit of encouragement to get back into this game right it's going to be another Juventus change by the way Sandro was booked there for that challenge so we've got Marquisio coming on into that midfield replacing Panic and I think that's sensible by Allegri knowing how close Panic is to being sent off to give them a little bit extra legs in that midfield because at the minute they've been dominated they can't get hold of the ball in there Marquisio's got to go in there and he's got to try and get hold of the ball and stop that dominance from Real Madrid two changes made by Allegri in quick succession only 20 minutes left for play here in Cardiff Real Madrid leading by three goals to one points for the 12 European Cup Champions League triumph now there's an offside flying raise against Disco and he's got to go into Juventus have to take it quickly so we've got three plays booked for Real Madrid, three plays booked now for Juventus Juventus on the attack Higuain goes down elaborately and the referee waves him up not full by that challenge similar thing again though Al isn't it ball up to him, Ramos is right behind his back there and he loses the ball it's too easy Ronaldo's just been filed Ronaldo's just come on, he's booked so Juventus take the lead in bookings four three it's not looking good for the Italian Champions they came into this game hoping to win their first ever treble now there are a treble down to one and time is running out 18 minutes to go here in Cardiff here's Disco into Benzema, Benzema plays it to the right side and Carvajal has it, Carvajal crosses into the penalty great clearance on the volley by Chiellini picked up by Modric again superb all night, back to Cruz back to the half way line and Baran on the Casamiro oh this is good football by Real Madrid there's a good shot and then Cruz in the D, Cruz takes the left foot and taps it on to Marcello drives it across and Ronaldo hits it first time, hits it high over the crossbar excellent play from Real Madrid Benzema has the opportunity to have a shot no, he thinks to go inside but just plays the ball down the left hand side of the Marcello who whips it across and it was a decent chance, wasn't it for Disco in the end did I fail to mention by the way the first time I've played for the Champions League final you did actually I'm useless I'm useless, like Heavens I've got some of the experience from Calabar Valenciere alongside me tonight here in Carta 17 minutes to go so down still not smiling but inwardly he'll know one Spanish hand is on the trophy throw in for Real Madrid on the far side of the field throw into the centre circle and he kicked to Real Madrid if Juventus had brought that ball under control then they were in a really good attacking position at least they were a little bit closer to Cruz and midfield of Real Madrid there though Cruz plays it and it goes on to the far side, now it's into Cruz again seeing a lot of the ball with German finds his full back Marcello and then he directs Marcello to play it back to Sergio Ramos on to Casimiro loose by Casimiro but the Juventus well they intercept but they can't keep possession and they're suddenly looking a bit tired Juventus I'm giving the ball away, they're working so hard to try and get the ball back but when they get it they look tired, they look shattered very heavy-legged at the minute there is Modric to Veran and Veran on his left foot he's gliding it towards the left flank but it's headed away by Juventus Cudrado keeps it on playing this near side of the field the substitute running with purpose towards the penalty area but he's wildly over hit that cross and it goes out of play to throw into the far side of the field well it's a nothing ball isn't it, he's in a decent position down the right hand side, he comes inside and he picks his head up and he tries to pick Iguayi out but it's a terrible ball and goes out for a throw in it's a mark of the the stature of Real Madrid Juventus only conceded three goals on the way to the final and they conceded three goals to Real tonight and it could be more you know here's Isco, the cruise Benzema to his left, Benzema's rolled in free into the penalty area Benzema tries to pass the ball into the net it's half cleared and then the shot driven by Marcelo over the cross far behind for the goal kick well Juventus are now starting to push forward and one or two gaps are starting to open up they have to take one or two chances which will suit Ronaldo and Benzema as it is at the minute and Isco down to the ground and Juventus in possession and then they're half way line they've got seven players now inside the Madrid half asking you all the defence of Real counter attack if they get possession and they get possession and cruise inside the centre circle with Rung the pass to Ronaldo Ronaldo knew he was offside so he made no serious attempt to play the ball and it's cleared by both four but again wasn't it it was Real Madrid hitting them on the break and there's a lot of space out there now onto Isco Isco's had a very good game as well but I'm sure you know if it's 3-1 into the final 10 minutes there must be a temptation of Zidane to bring on Gareth Bale Isco runs forward they tried to pull him down and well done the referee he was fouled earlier in the move he let the play continue to see if there was any advantage for Isco there wasn't and the referee pulls them back and gives the free kick to Real Madrid so clever from Isco wasn't it the way he controlled the ball and just ran away from Alves there but the referee got it right he was definitely being pulled by Alves 14 minutes to go 3-1 to Real Madrid against Juventus and you're listening to 5 like the World Service and Radio Wales and what was I saying Gareth Bale for first to come on for Real Madrid cruise to take this free kick for the Spanish champions it's a long way out he's not going to shoot from this range and in fact the substitutions will be made and it's Benzema who will be replaced not Isco and he wasn't taking Ronaldo off was he when he's on a hat trick not a cat and hails chance that would be a transfer request in the morning so Benzema comes off I think he's on the radio I just think he's he's surrounded by starlets he played the role perfectly there's a lot of work off the ball which is unable Ronaldo to use that space so effectively right, immediately Bale gives his manager's instructions to changes in position one of them will be to Isco, Bale's in the penalty area cruise to take the free kick finally flicking it into the box doesn't find a Real Madrid head Codrado with the clearance for Juventus but it just runs across the halfway line back into Real's possession and the ball goes back to Navas we mustn't forget the significance of the save Navas made early on in the game from Panjic very strong right hand keeping the ball out and another Real Madrid player has been knocked to the ground and the referee having a word he's not going to take too much more that was Lameena when did he slip on with it? just come on about 30 seconds ago did you notice who we're talking about? don't know but Lameena is on there's so much happening it is it's such a good game of football it's hardly stopped for a breath being dominated by Real Madrid at this moment in time and for most of the second half the captain Ramos takes the three kick captain played by the head of Gareth Bale but his header doesn't find a colleague and now it's with Juventus but surely they're running out of ideas I think they're running out of strength and pace now they look really tired and frankly if it had been 3-1 to Juventus we would have seen the same impact on Real Madrid give great credit to Madrid for that the way they've dominated the possession the way they've kept on going they've been relentless this second half they want to throw on the far side of the field precisely what he was doing that flicked it into the body of Juventus but it goes a legman screams at his players but can they get two goals back in the remaining 11 minutes to take us into extra time what's happening out there in the pitch the Real throw goes into the Juventus half not for long healini plays it to Bernucci Bernucci just chips it forward hoping to find Caudral chested away by Ramos it was Debala who went off thanks to the studio for that I'll take his name out of my list Debala well he had been yellow carded as well he had actually missed a second yellow card so again perhaps that's diplomatic substitution as much as anything else made by Allegri now the ball played towards Ronaldo on the right side Ronaldo heads it on crosses it towards Bale and he's intercepted by Bernucci still not out of play almost a Welsh goal that was incredible that was Carvajal had the ball in the right back position and Ronaldo went short as if to go and get the ball short just spun his man and sprinted into the space Carvajal knocked it over the top and Ronaldo did him for pace and he tried to push it in the middle for a tap in for Bale but he just got his foot there defender he kept it away. Not for Bernucci, Bale would have scored which would have been the perfect end to the evening for Real Madrid I think they're destined to win the Champions League tonight though though they're protesting to the assistant on the near side of the field for the award of a free kick to Juventus there's a good opportunity for Juventus put a bit of pressure back on to Real Madrid a free kick in a dangerous position on the right hand side Alves is set to take it. Yeah, Danny Alves to take it and there are already five, six Juventus players, seven Juventus players inside the Madrid penalty area considerable presence candid delivery from Danny Alves be good enough here it comes it's played off with the near post and headed on that would have been Navas if it had been on target La Mina no it was Sandro actually. Sandro made the run towards the near post. A glancing header if he had got it on target it was 3-2 well it was a good ball in from Danny Alves with a bit of pace on it and Sandro just came from the far post crossed everyone towards the near post and just a glancing header from this angle we thought it was in it was just floating away from that far post there a decent opportunity though 8 minutes to go Real Madrid change and Isco is going off supreme applause from the Real fans I mean if he was going off and they were losing maybe he wouldn't get so richly applauded but I think he's had a really good game. He's been excellent he's been excellent he's been involved in everything he demanded the ball he's wanted the ball and he's been a nuisance to that Juventus backline. Asensio comes on and we've got 8 minutes to go plus some added time may not make that much difference to the outcome though Juventus won Real Madrid 3 Navas with the goal kick driven to the left side towards Bale Bale jumps well, heads it inland so to speak but it's with Benucci and Benucci plays it forward to Mckesia trying to rush away from Cruz finds Chiellini Kiellini hits it over the half way line Italian half by Varan and then it's flicked back to Benucci time running out on it goes to the right side and Dani Elves Dani Elves and it's fed forward to Cuadrado Tackle strongly balls out of play and then Cruz reacts as if Cuadrado has kicked him Ramos right in front. Oh sorry Sergio Ramos has done that and it's a yellow card for Cuadrado and he's off a red card and that was all about the reaction by Sergio Ramos Honestly he might have clipped him but there was no need for Ramos to go down right in front of the linesman, no not at all look there's nothing a matter with him why has he gone down for Well it's not finished this because a few players are going now well done the event is played just telling Cuadrado get off you have to accept it but I'd love to see that challenge again Cuadrado is off, the event is a down to 10 man the 3-1 down here's the replay what did Cuadrado do wrong no it maybe when he got up well he gave Ramos a push in the back it was a brilliant Tackle first and foremost from Ramos it was aggressive yes but it was a good ball but Rado was silly but there was no need for Ramos to go down there I said to it about 10 minutes ago his manager was going to come on and create something do something for the team not something stupid like that well that's a great shame but the yellow cards were mounting and you could see a red card emerging Real Madrid are going to win this final in Cardiff 3-1 up and now a man up and we've only got 6 minutes plus out of time remaining so there will be no extra time tonight there will be no penalties in Cardiff here's Benucci for Juventus I'm just sorry that someone was sent off it was just sustain on the final that was so unnecessary and Ramos a player who knows all about red cards well he induced a red card there for Cuadrado and exclusively he had to time the Tackle perfectly anyway Ramos and he did that it was a hard Tackle but it was a fair one Sandro plays the ball in field Juventus to the credit I've got everybody inside the rail half across the ball into the penalty the header down then it's put away by Verran still inside the penalty area collected on the far side of the field should be cleared and is cleared to the half way line that was a big opportunity there for Manzukic lovely ball in, floated in there and he's free Manzukic 6 or 7 yards out, it looked as if he didn't want ahead of that his cruise has given the ball away very carelessly rail Madrid becoming just a little bit complacent time running out with the man advantage but they must keep their minds firmly on the time that's left to make sure they win their 12th European Champions League or European Cup Juventus played the ball into the Madrid penalty area Hegareng tries to turn it go-wards but he's behind for a goal kick there's destiny, a great chance there for Manzukic, it's a free header it looks as if he pulled his head away he didn't really want to head it Manzukic, it's a good ball in and he's free it's only 7 yards out Navas the Real goalkeeper we're just seeing this incident again there may have been the slightest tap on Ramas's ankle but there's no excuse for reacting like that there's no need for anything to hold on like that not at all you know and it's not just for a pleasure, I can name English first because you do the same thing just leave the referee to do his job correctly, don't react like that when there's no need for it 3.5 minutes of the 19 minutes remaining 3-1 Real Madrid lead Juventus Juventus still, push the ball forward that's well-chested back by Carvajal who is goalkeeper Navas Navas quickly throws it out to Ramas and Ramas forward to Cruz Ramas again and now Ramas glides it towards the right side headed on but Ramas is not chasing after that there's going to be another Real Madrid alteration so we will have had 6 substitutions so that's a minimum of 3 minutes of added time and the goals and the goals which will actually be painful for Juventus so they're on the attack now Navas comes diving, gets his hands to the ball, the Juventus throw a tumble over Navas is complaining to Daniela there wasn't anything, I don't think Daniela threw himself down trying to win a penalty kick Navas was excellent there, he was sharp, he was alert because he had not had a lot to do this second half little through ball but there was no way it was a penalty it was a clean challenge by the goalkeeper Madrid have just got to see this game out now they've got to keep hold of the ball Ronaldo to Verran and now Ramas Cruz available Cruz who has held that defensive that midfield positioned very well and has been really influential in the second half in particular it's back to Navas, to Ramas on to Cruz and Cruz just happy to win the throw in off Daniela's feet and here comes the final change it'll be Tony Cruz who's coming off actually and Marata coming on Tony Cruz has been excellent as well in that midfield alongside Moderich in there particularly second half they haven't given that midfield of Juventus a kick they've dominated in there the one and two touch passing from both himself and Moderich has been superb second half very very good performance yeah Cruz being embraced by every colleague he meets on the way towards the far touch line it had to be the far touch line of course and Cruz you know punching the air with both of his fists towards the Madrid fans knowing he will get his hands as well on the Champions League trophy shortly so Marata is on Juventus won Real Madrid 3 no more substitutions Juve fans respond to the Real Madrid chance by holding up their scarves at the moment many many of them feeling the pain of inevitable defeat the throw goes to Moderich Moderich tries to cross the ball it's just with Marata on the edge of the D back to Moderich, Moderich tackled the ball look who's running over to the ball Ronaldo what is it 30 yards out well he's on hat trick there's only one guy taking this free kick I think a fail have said to him what about Misham told in English or Portuguese where to go Moderich again though superb getting that ball and driving his team forward they had the option of Ronaldo out to the right hand side it was just a little deflection he's off to getting to in the first place he's got a shoot, there's no question about this 6 preface preface full step back which here he comes forward he shoots it hits the ball and it rebounds towards the left side towards Marcello good turn by Marcello beats the defender, into the penalty pulls it back it's 4-1 and it's Marata Marata he's only been on the on the pitch a few seconds he scores the fourth goal for Real Madrid being no doubt it was one before this goal but it is, Juventus won Real Madrid 4 how good was that from Marcello the touch, the turn, so quick so sharp in and around the penalty area he knows the defender can't touch him he goes past him with ease but then picks his head up puts a superb ball in for a tap in for Marata, what a goal all over he's looking to invention his health thank you for bringing me on thank you, thank you, thank you they have been brilliant this second half Real Madrid, absolutely superb I mean that was Ronaldo's free kick it rebounded off the wall, fantastic work by Marcello, getting into the penalty pulling it back and it's into the net in a flash for Real's fourth goal of the night but he's got the calmness Marcello to pick his head up, to look into the box and see where he is, pick out Marata superb finish Mayor Copa, it's a sensio sorry sensio, my apologies again all excited we both were, but it's a sensio it was still great play from Marcello yes it was still great play from Marcello he made the goal out here cheers now for your defenders fans and Navas celebrates think back to that save he made in the opening minutes of the game sensio in the 90th minute much time will be added on 4 minutes it's a bit mean actually but I think the defenders have had enough now down to 10 man and 4-1 down Marcello tries to feed the ball forward it's handled by Daniel Alves, it's a free kick free kick to Real Madrid but the turn and the technique from Marcello and when he gets in there to have a tap in he's Sergio Ramos Sergio Ramos will be the first to lift this Champions League trophy in successive seasons and they're attacking again Real Madrid but the ball hits the defender and Uve managed to clear it towards this near side of the field the end of the game can't come quickly enough for them to eye but Real when the ball back with Casimiro who scored the second goal to put the Spanish side in front in the second half after the Manzuchich wonder goal had leveled it at 1-1 in the first half we forget about that now the quality of that goal such is the quality of the Madrid performance in the second half Alan and the first half they played their part in a very very good open 45 minutes but there's only been one team in this in the second half absolute total dominance here's Bell a minute of added time remaining before the Spanish celebrations can begin properly and Bell wins the ball again Bell coming forward Bell shoots blocked by the defender rebounds to Juventus possession they've got it in this near side of the field impossible to score three goals they've got a free kick Gareth Bale had the option there to pass that in it was a much simpler pass to pass Marathe in down the left hand side but he wasn't going to pass he wanted to score, he wanted to be the gore himself that was an arm raised in the far side of the field and the referee spotted it don't make it worse Juventus, you've already had one player sent off that was Manzuchich who raised his arm which is definitely a free kick to Real Madrid I'm counting down the ten seconds that remain such a contrast from one end of the stadium at the moment depression to the right celebration to the left and now the celebration start properly the final whistle is gone and it's another fantastic triumph for Ronaldo and for Real Madrid and for Zinedine Sadan, he is a coach that's retained the title in two successive seasons they were awesome the second half they were a very good first half but whatever Zidane said to them it worked too perfectly because they couldn't get near the Juventus in the second half their passing was too quick for them their thinking was too quick for them and the ability that they showed in the second half they picked their passes at the right time they went at them, they were aggressive in their forward play and they dominated in the second half and Ronaldo again, the way he took his second goal the way he floated into the space and we've given that defensive back ground so much praise this season in big games but tonight they were outdone and they were outdone by Ronaldo and a quick play from the Real Madrid players and such sportsmanship from Gigi Bufon he's made sure he's embraced every single Real Madrid in his vicinity no matter his disappointment it's been a great performance and even though they ran away with it in the second half Alan such was the quality of Madrid's play it didn't diminish the triumph in any way whatsoever it wasn't as if we got the Juventus it was the Real Madrid with that good they were that good and they've got to give them huge credit for that because as I said they got hold of the ball and every opportunity every single player whenever they got the ball it seemed as if they had time to take a touch to turn to pick their head up to play the next pass and they were just too good and too quick for that Juventus team in the second half is it a Ronaldo tramp or is it a Madrid tramp you know what I mean? you know what Ronaldo is like well they say don't the big players turn up in big games Ronaldo has again Real Madrid have beaten Juventus by four goals to one
