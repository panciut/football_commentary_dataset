 We knew in advance that they would do that. The players felt that was important. They have done that and the Brazilian referee Rafael Klaus blows his whistle. Iran get us underway and this very first official international match between England and Iran is underway. England and Iran their first match at this World Cup this 2022 World Cup and England in the white shirts with the blue trim, blue across the shoulders, blue shorts and white socks and England playing from left to right as we look in this first half. This wide open very airy stadium I must say. It certainly doesn't feel oppressive inside the ground obviously the air-conditioned system is working but England with the ball on the pitch surface which is entirely in shade I must say as well. So none of the players down there in direct sunlight either and England in possession if you've just switched on to us on five live 4-3-3 the England system that Garrel Southgate starting with and that involves Kieran Trippier the in-form new Castleman on the right-hand side. Jude Bellingham takes over and then the ball is back to the halfway line again and Harry Maguire will be some focus on his involvement today. Maguire and Sterling as well winning his 80th cap Raheem Sterling joining the 80 plus hot cap club for England. He gets a touch on the left hand side now and then back it goes to John Stones in the centre circle. So Stones and Maguire the two central defenders Trippier on the right, Sean the left, Pickford in goal winning his 46th cap then Rice with Darringham and Mount in midfield and Saka and Sterling either side of Harry Kane through the middle. Harry Kane on 51 goals for England so just two behind Wayne Rooney's record for the England men's team and also remember Harry Kane has scored ten goals in finals tournaments and that is level with Gary Linnick as Wreckle. He has Trippier now down the right-hand side whips the ball across Sterling was there was headed away comes out to Bellingham who gives it back to Rice then the ball to the left-hand side for the in-form now Luke Shaw slips it forward into the penalty area but will bounce away through for what is given as the first corner of the match. Mason Mount just allowed it to roll because it had taken a touch off an Iranian defender. Yeah really confident start from England really good start everyone getting a feel of the ball but the time he finished then England had the ball the entire time you introduce the introduction there John and they took every single player got the foot on the ball creating some space here Trippier down the right-hand side getting a good cross in Sterling could have just attacked it going second guess himself but strong start remember four years ago England scored nine set pieces out of their 12 goals first set piece for England at this will come Trippier swings it in to the back post and now players have gone down McGuire has gone down England feel that he was manhandled over McGuire gets to his feet now the referee has come across here and is very calmly looking at the situation and the suggestion was that Chesme had his arms wrapped around Harry McGuire and we're looking at the replay which shows he's been rugby tackled on the ground absolutely yep you're right and there's a new directive less blocking less manhandling in the penalty area but he's certainly two arms around him it was a full on rugby contact and John Storms going down he would he got to what he've got to the ball no it wasn't a bad ball in but his run was impeded play has halted we are waiting for a restart Garry Southgate's asking the question the referee I think this could be a no no he says play play on it's a goal kick that's the end of it and so much for that FIFA directive there we go so she put direct it in the last one you know in the weeks leading up to the tournament there will be zero tolerance of handling and holding opponents in penalty areas it set pieces first set piece Harry McGuire is absolutely wrestled with the ground they are have a look at it decide there's no case to us there's no there's not a lot you can add to really is there that it was a clear penalty it's a clear foul it's a wonderful example in the second game of what's it what what you need to be giving it's not given so there we are England 0 Iran 0 5 live and BBC sounds on the second day of this World Cup and Rice with Trippier at the back played across England's 7th consecutive World Cup the 16th in all and England with the ball inside their own half playing it across let's not forget though that it is Iran's third consecutive World Cup as well all under the tutelage of coach Carlos Kieros now 69 years old the former Manchester United assistant manager to Salix Ferguson he was asked yesterday whether he'd been in touch with Salix about some tips on how to beat the English but he said no no no nothing could be further from my mind the words to that effect so here's McGuire at the back giving it to the right to stones even though he said he spoke to Alex Ferguson on a regular basis Bellingham back into center field and Harry McGuire now England who could easily have won an early penalty but said this Brazilian referee certainly if he if he saw it he ignored it and if the AR looked at it they decided that it wasn't there wasn't enough there here's Rice playing the ball across to his left Bellingham now through the middle Mason Mount is there Shaw arrives on the left hand side good cross from Shaw towards the back post sack I was after that half headed away comes out England again Trippier goes back into the center circle and again the full backs pull wide here Shaw on the left hand side Trippier on the right and it is the new Castleman who ends up with the ball at his feet plays it forward it was half blocked away Saka is now onto this Pocayo Saka the ball is right on the white line near the corner flag that is kept in play down there by Hussainy and eventually the ball is put out of play for an England throw down the right that's really good play really clever play from Saka that he's pressing he presses it hard but just didn't press hard enough to give away about the ball in as well it's good pressure from England they're gonna see a lot the ball Cheshire as we thought from midfield is dropping into that backline he's another centre back now so effectively a flatback five and it's allowing the wing the full backs of England just to push on and create more options high up England bird on the halfway line England nil Iran nil and Saka skips away from a couple of challenges still going but then the next challenges a foul it's a free kick it was tripped and it's a free kick ten yards inside the Iranian it's gonna be tight in there for Saka he's got he's got to pick and choose his moments it's good skill it was a rice choice because they were committed into the tackle but it's just gonna be so congested so tight that that midfield four in front of them is gonna be very very narrow for the whole game just wonder where England are gonna find the space Harry Kane he's gonna walk you by the three cent and a half free kick taken quickly down the right hand side Kane swings it into the back post and a stretch goalwards by Rice who was arriving could only steer it wide into the into the far outside side netting and two Iranian players have collided the goalkeeper Baron van and also the number 19 Majid Hussaini as the ball was swung across by Harry Kane dangerously the two of them in an attempt to defend it the goalkeeper got a touch and the two of them have gone chest to chest I think not head to head or do you think it was they did catch oh yeah they did they did we see on the replay and that will take a little bit of time to sort that out because that there has to be a head injury protocol taking place here that's without question yeah that was nasty and it was one where neither player knew that the either was there and it's a full-on collision non-stopping there was no breaking there was no bracing for either of them really good ball from Harry Kane and Matt you just down there just wondering if you're at the wrong end are you with England pressing a little this way down here at the moment just in a big stat come up on the screen of possession is 81% England at the moment and you know it speaks volumes about where they are but I've just noticed on this right-hand side who were talking about Bellingham before the game and what his role was going to be was he going to sit was he going to push on he's really drifting over to this right-hand side sack has coming inside as well and that run from Trippier on the obelisk I mean he's going wide and high all the time so that little interchanged between those three little triangles I think it's definitely that area that Bellingham is going to drift into the right-hand side of the pitch so that is Matt Upson who's watching from behind the goal to our left so Jordan Pickford's goal in the first half that was telling me before the match is he can't remember ever watching a match at this level from behind the goal so new experience for Matt Upson I have at times I shouldn't have been in the goal deep into behind the back line but just looking at the around goalkeeper Arambard he's in a real pick a little bit of real problems I think he's broken his nose in there certainly blood streaming out of it yeah well in a bad bad way yeah it was it was a as opposed to sort of forehead top of the head collision it wasn't it was like face-to-face lower face to lower face and it would appear now they are warming up as we said before the game Carlos Keros has picked four goalkeepers in his squad of only 25 and here we are in the first 10 minutes of the the first match and one of our most important players Alireza Baron van has gone down and it I mean your experience Rob I'm sure you've broken your nose as a goalkeeper you know he can you feasibly continue if he has I you shouldn't full stop I think from there the way that your brain works in the way that your perception we talked about perceptions on the pitch and you're so frazzled mentally now they're asking to be a player at the top level at the world stage at this is doing your team at this service your country to service it shouldn't happen just come off and move on because it's a really really nasty blow yeah lengthy stoppage England nil Iran nail if you just switched on to us on five live the matches on BBC one as well by the way if you're on your way home Guy Mopry and Jameen Genus are not too far away from where we're sitting here and in actual fact with any of the matches that are live on BBC television from this World Cup you can go to the red button and the five live radio commentary is synced up with the TV pictures World Cup extra believe it's called which strangely enough I picked up that message we've had lots of messages but that was one that had slipped through the net so look out for World Cup extra to do that still a stoppage continues and this this does not look good I must say for for Baron van the goalkeeper who is still down on his side and is still being treated a couple of his teammates are there as well but the medical people are doing their thing and you would have to think that they are going to make a change and the goalkeepers it looks like it's Hussain Hussaini who is the most likely replacement of the possible three he's warming up on this touch line down below us and just looking at him there fairly relaxed hasn't got his gloves on I desperately clean to get my gloves on and get a feel of the ball because what you don't want to be going is going on cold not having touched the ball for half an hour touch of the ball get a feel get get yourself in the game because all of a sudden massive massive moment well why hasn't he got his gloves on I have no idea the goalkeeper coaches got his gloves on he's just decided not to but I don't know whether he feels that he is whether he's waiting to get the nod to say is coming on but he's coming back now to to get his gloves on it's just taking such a while to yeah he's still he's lying on his back now and and they are now I think indicating that they're going to have to make a change so clearly Baron van felt that he might be able to continue but they've made the call there 12 minutes on the clock that they're going to have to make the change while they are attending to that and the stretcher is being prepared although Baron van is just now sitting up so he's leaning forward and having another look at him but I think they I mean surely they have to make this change and yet I see Hussain Hussaini is is now getting ready properly now if you were listening before the match we mentioned that there was a problem with the ticketing that for some of the England fans and that they were being sent to to a ticket resolution center and that there were long queues we heard from our own colleague John Southall who was outside the ground that there were long queues and there was concern about whether people were going to get in we're now hearing from some of our other BBC colleagues that there was a frantic build-up for some England supporters who couldn't enter the stadium because that ticket app crashed but all who were there at that queue are now in the ground and it would appear according to our BBC colleagues that those in charge told them to just go in and it looked like that nothing was being checked for fans to enter the stadium so looking down to my left it does look as though the England section to have a left behind where Matt Upson is down there is pretty much full so back on the pitch England nail Iran nail we've had a long long stoppage because the Iranian goalkeeper Ali Reza Baron van collided with Majid Hussaini the central defender is a clash of faces it looks as though Baron van does broken his nose one of the substitute goalkeepers Hussain Hussaini is ready to come on but Baron van has not yet left the field and we were just seeing pictures here and television screened in the in the comedy position I mean his nose has swelled up to almost twice the size he's just changed his shorts remark of he must been something for blood and but it's I can't believe he's gonna carry on he should have gone back on but it's after all the noises and talk of protocols regarding concussion and things like that it's it's incredible that he's even considering carrying on well that the the highly experienced Iranian captain Aysan Haissafi is there with him as well talking to him that chatting away he's just given him a pat on the bottom and then run away into his position they are putting Baron van's gloves back on and it seems that they are satisfied that he is going to be able to continue just remarkable England just shoot because he will be seeing about four or five balls right now and whether you pick the right one or not is a I can't see this being safe I've got to say to me he looks gazed yeah he looks gazed this is a decision that we take should be taken out of his hands well with quite possibly a broken nose the Iranian goalkeeper Alireza Baron van is going to continue and his players going to resume with a goal kick it is still England Nell Iran Nell this is BBC Radio 5 live at the Qatar World Cup and Baron van takes the goal kick and it lands just over the halfway line where Rice was underneath it and came out of the left-hand side and England surged forward with Mason Mount turns away from the challenge and then knocked it back to Rice just now well Rob I'm sure it's natural for you to look to Baron van and just I mean I'm looking at him no he's leaning forward with his hands on his knees and he's rubbing the side of his head he's staring at the ground he's got his hands on his face how he can focus on the game let alone save a shot that long I don't know that's coming out that is now taking a knee he's gone down on one knee he's indicating he's signaling that England should not take this throw the referee now has spotted it and is going to run back over towards the goalkeeper who's now flopped down on his bat and surely that has to be the end of his involvement in this match well that was it's just a ludicrous situation that they are even considered to ask him the question as to whether he can carry on or not so the his concerned teammates have run across there and now there is the clear signal from the medical people who are still behind the goal there and you know that there are going to be questions about that about the decision for him to even carry on for what a minute or so if that matter of seconds before he realized that he was not going to be able to play any further part in this yeah it's a massive step backwards with that in that situation in terms of the progression that we're trying to make as a sport in terms of the safety of players to listen to a player who's just clearly had his nose broken so do you think you want to carry on oh my well no sorry no so the stretcher is coming on I mean this is all happening at the opposite end of the ground from where Matt Upson is but you will have a view of sorts on it I'm sure yeah I do have exactly the same opinion as you I mean I can't really see too much luckily Jordan Pickford can keep you quite entertained down here anyway with there's nothing going on but it just seems like a ludicrous protocol that's been followed because how can he continue the decision should have been made and also it's taking so much time in the game that it's just slowing everything down it should have just been an early decision he clearly can't carry on the knocks too bad and fortunately I can see into the bench and the goalkeeper coming on now has his gloves on and Matt what's it done to the atmosphere down there you're questioning it before the game yeah saying it's a bit of a questionable atmosphere it's it's filled up now but what was it what's it down on the touchline must be fairly subdued yeah well you'd expect it wouldn't you because then there's no nothing happening you know the games been paused for so long even though just restarted it didn't really get going it was so clear that the goalkeeper couldn't carry on so everyone's just quiet standing up nobody's really sitting down everyone's up on their feet trying to observe and see what's going on because we're quite away from that goal we can obviously see the bodies around the stretcher but you know the fans especially are a long way from that far goal and the England players now are they they've been warming up because it's almost like a chance of having to start again yeah they're doing a little bit of footwork having a chat McGuire and Stones just talking to each other a few a few little chats but I think they're ready to go and it's been a bright start hasn't it I think they've looked quite confident on the ball and looking like they can probe and ask that question but a lengthy lengthy stoppage that must have been going on ten minutes nineteen minutes on the clock now and the applause because Alireza Baron has now been stretched it away and Hussain Hussaini who comes on to win his eighth cap for Iran missed out on the year on the World Cup four years ago was in the preliminary squad but not selected by Carlos Kieros but last season was in very good form for the Iranian champions S.Teglam so he suddenly thrust into the World Cup action here after England have made a strong start to the match in the in such play as there has been so far in this game and we will have just to warn you as I say a good ten minutes about a time at the end of this first half England coming forward then from left to right sterling's balling towards the edge of the penalty area but that's blocked away and Iran take it away with the former Brighton man Alireza Jahan back over on that far side but his passing field is straight with the feet of Declan Rice who's able to tie you to your up even though he slipped over and finally the ball has played back to Jordan Pickford I'm not sure how many touches Pickford has had in the game so far long clearance from him which comes back towards the edge of the England penalty area and then stones put in a challenge on Tarramy no free kick given for that thought he might have got man rather than ball but the referee saw it as a clean tackle so now England with it with Mahal on the left hand side the left back and then Darynger puts in the challenge inside the play for a three to Iran who are playing from right to left the highest ranked Asian team in the World rankings remember they are number 20 in the world as the throwing is taken and there is a foul by Bellingham and it's a free kick to Iran here on the left hand side so they have the first chance to have a set piece of their own is the captain Aysan Haissathi who was fouled by Bellingham near the touch line on the left so England have to defend a set piece now yeah just too keen bit naive that from Bellingham going in bit too hard Iran want to win three kicks it's a huge chance for them it's one of the better opportunities they're gonna get previous there you have much get forwards didn't have anyone to pass through facing five England players this now a real threat England nil Iran nil but your handbatches come across here the number seven now playing for for Feyenoord after moving on from Brighton and either it'll be an in-swinger from him no in fact he runs away from it it's going to be it is going to be Jahan Batch who plays it in he checked his run came back England weren't fooled it was a poor delivery actually it was cleared away but now Iran cross from the right hand side to the back post it's over everyone inside the box bounces out into the opposite in back area and Jahan Batch is dispossessed and then incomes are challenged to put it out of play clean tackle on sack out and it's a throwing to England half way inside their own territory well when we're saying it's an opportunity for Iran one of the better opportunities they'll get and it's two really poor balls in one too short one too long England will be relieved to get back on the ball again and play out like they are I think perhaps in the old days you would have said well will that long-stoppage have disrupted England but to be honest it's such a feature of matches now whether it's international or in the Premier League or wherever you go that we do you know it's common now isn't it to have five six seven eight nine minute breaks so the players are more attuned to it here's stones on the halfway line John Stones passing it back to his left to Harry McGuire just five starts from Manchester United this season in all competitions McGuire the Gareth Southgate keeps faith with him ball forward from McGuire is cleared away back downfield for England and then a foul on the near the halfway line on Mason Mount who was looking for it but does get it and a free kick near the halfway line on the cross out. He's picking up some nice positions Mason Mount he's drifting out to the left hand side but you're looking at the midfield he's just taking a position outside the Iran midfield and allows him to buys him a bit of space basically in behind your hand back who's one of the more attack minded players important touch there to give it to Shaw on the left hand side Sterling gives it back to Shaw now Shaw's a little cross there are two defenders there it's blocked by one or possibly both of them took the pace off it and Iran were able to clear it out on the far side. The Iranian approach is abundantly clear here for all Carlos Kira's when he was talking to us yesterday I was in the room when he was holding his pre-match press conference he was talking about the spirit of adventure etc etc it's a very very cautious approach from Iran. It's all about perspective with adventure isn't it over the halfway line maybe but it's something that England are gonna have to really come back here is deep line area watching in the picture for the game the research saying your hand back is the one that loses his discipline he will go he will chase the ball that's what I think Mason Mount and Sterling I'm sure are gonna play on on that left hand side. So England nil Iran nil not to say that defenders and goalkeepers can't be adventurous people of course Rob. We'll have our own ways and yeah but this free kick has hit long downfield by Iran towards the edge of the England penalty area headed away by McGuire and then Rice's and Rice and Shaw and that's a yellow card because the challenge came in from Jahan Batch on Luke Shaw and caught him and Shaw is on his feet and he's okay and I sounded concerned there and he was top of his foot was stood on by Jahan Batch who is shown a yellow card first yellow card of the match Jahan Batch is boot and the concern there because don't know about you of the players that England could ill afford to lose to injury I would put Luke Shaw pretty close to the top of the list. You're looking at options other than a Luke Shaw and it's slim pickings isn't it? And now a foul by Hussainy on Mason Mount another foul on Mason Mount England with free kick ten yards inside the Iranian half and announcement inside the ground. Very loud announcement in several languages to tell us that Jahan Batch was boot. Ball played forward towards the edge of the area Kane was looking for that. Saka does well actually into the challenge to win it back and then England there's a double deflection which takes it out on the left hand side here. Mohamedy though for Iran and then Tiramid drags the ball back was challenged by Trippie threw himself to the ground wanted a free kick and the referee says no way England throw. Well in unison Trippie and the referee suggested to get up and he did. That is Mehdi Tiramid of Porto clearly one of the danger men 13 goals for Porto in 18 appearances this season and five in the Champions League and remember they won their group here's Saka Saka back to Bellingham Bellingham out to the right hand side to Trippie and then in field again Saka trying to find a way through between two Iranian defenders one of them went down rather easily but the referee says that was a free kick free kick to Iran half inside their own box so we've played almost half an hour although in fairness we lost ten minutes of that time to a really nasty injury facial injury to the Iranian goalkeeper Ali Reza Berenvand who was clattered in the face by his own central defender Majid Hussaini. Seem to come off OK actually he's been able to continue. He's not really talked about it him. I mean it wasn't great for him either Hussaini but Berenvand stretched it off. Hussaini has come on and the other incident of note the fact that and it's all in a sense of purposes England it seems should have had a penalty. Ball given away by Iran now Kane takes it up but a recovering challenge bounces for Mount. A low pass along the edge of the penalty area to Saka. Saka back under his left foot curls it goalwards but an easy take for goalkeeper Hussaini his first involvement just dropped forward and was able to scoop the ball up on the half body off the turf. Thank you very much Mr Saka a touch of the ball for Hussaini and Hussaini and he relieved all that it was the right idea from Saka trying to feed it into the far post it's kind of outnumbered going down the dead end really came back out again. Just wasn't the right execution. The other thing as well that Iran have lost with the injury to Berenvand is his long throwing his prodigious long throws which are a big part of their game. As England now playing the ball out from the back and Declan Rice goes for a long crossfield pass to Tribya who under pressure heads the ball forward to Saka who was fouled by Hussaini so it's a pre-kick another foul the match has been littered with fouls one way or the other mainly against England players. Yeah and it's the quick switch it's a quick switch at England there Declan Rice was the one to do it deep in their own half but even in the Iran half he just got to switch the ball quick cross the ball quick don't allow them to get set. I presume that Berenvand will have been stretched out of the ground and maybe taken to the medical centre for treatment such I mean the disappointment you have to really feel for him don't you too but that to happen in the first ten minutes of your World Cup experience. Really tough for him and he's been preparing for weeks and building up to it as a target as a goal in your career and then something literally unforeseen. Didn't have a clue he was there. Amazing story as well his back story from a nomadic family in rural Iran he was you know a shepherding family and now it's a race to the heights that he has in the world game and you know Sheep Farmer's sons are tough people he wanted to carry on he has Saka now down the right hand side for England into the full back position cuts it back onto his right foot Tribia back to Saka again and then Tribia again goes in field to Saka to Stirling who tries to angle it back Saka's ball into the post and then Mount with the shot arriving on it corner of the six yard box there was a defender there and on the whip he couldn't get that the whip that he actually wanted and struck the shot into the outside of the net. Yeah too tight an angle really for the shot but good play from England good shot one touch football well done from Saka almost bunted the ball into the penalty area into that near post space. He's thinking he didn't really probably have another option but to try the shot on but again just that fast bit of interchange around the box that what's makes a difference. England nil around nil that's Rob Green that Upson is down there pitch side behind the goal but not seeing a great deal of the action because he's at Jordan Pickford's end in this first half we have three commentaries today on Five Live all live from here in Qatar from four o'clock GMT it'll be Senegal Netherlands with Alastair Bruce Ball and Chris Sutton they will be I'm sure in position in the stadium now and then tonight it is the Wales return to the World Cup so join us for that Kelly Cates will be in the Ahmad Bin Ali stadium as England defending at the back being put us in the pressure but Bellingham did well against two opponents and passed the ball back and now it's broke forward by Mount still carrying it forward up towards the corner of the penalty area he's still going to spend his backing off and then he checks back and then Mount plays the ball across to the right-hand side Trippier works across Kane with a header across the penalty area and that is headed away but not completely clear by Iran Jude Bellingham is onto it for England still just 19 years old all lovely footwork from Sterling into the edge of the penalty area and then the challenge came in from Magic Hussain he put it behind for an England corner. That's a lovely wonderful bit of skill from Raheem Sterling a little touch a little nutmeg thought he had the opportunity just got through but again it's good for England. Iran go to press actually having the strength and the conviction the passing and the skill to get out of that press and then you're away so games almost in two sections around the England penalty area then around the Iran that whole centre of the pitch which is bypassed. Trippier to take this corner from the right-hand side and get the ball himself the hoardings are quite a long way behind the goals here and the ball was up against it so he's done that puts the ball in the quadrant Trippier waiting to take this and we now know that they can wrestle each other as much as they like you know we're not going to see a penalty so the Iranian defenders will think they've perhaps got more licence because of that earlier incident Trippier to take the corner and it's headed against the outside of the post. McGuire arriving on the stretch he managed to get that forehead to it but couldn't direct it on target and it hit the outside of the post and the Iranian goal survives and Iran bring it away down the other end with Mohammedi Mohammedi though loses out England were back quickly in numbers Bukhaya Saka as well stabs it forward but Bellingham can't reach that and it's out of play for a thrill but McGuire could easily have had a penalty earlier in the game and he could easily have scored the opening goal there it's struck the top of the bar actually next to the top of the post. It's so well to meet the ball every senior every bit of strength onto it all he can do is try and guide it Jordan Pickford celebrating at one end balls hitting the bar at the other actually John Stones was the one that was free but he just drifted over the top of him Harry McGuire did really well just to meet it that is a let-off and England are really causing problems for Iran from corners from from crosses well it was interesting there that John Stones just got free run clearly the referee has gone out of power the word in his ear maybe and certainly in the defenders ear to say look you do that again I'm gonna have to give one. Yeah but strictly speaking you shouldn't have to do two team second chances at a world cup I wouldn't mind one more on that later in the tournament in a few days time maybe England 0 Iran 0 USA to come and you will hear that USA Wales match from 7 o'clock tonight Ian Dennis and Dion Dublin James Collins as well as is involved in the coverage from back in the UK as Iran have the ball in their left back position and Ruth Bay Cheshmea that gives it away to Bellingham Bellingham tall stately graceful back to Trippia and now back to Stones and McGuire in the centre circle Harry McGuire very nearly came within just a few inches really or centimetres if you prefer from scoring England's first goal at this world cup McGuire plays the ball across McGuire who scored in both of the quarterfinals in the two previous Garra Southgate tournaments remember McGuire playing it to the edge of the area now with the touch Sterling is there now Shaw with the cross Bellingham heads it in England score and it's Jude Bellingham who scores England's first goal at this world cup and his first goal for England at 19 years old what a moment for this rising star England lead Iran by one goal to 0 with 10 minutes to go to half time a one end of the stadium erupts with the England fans in his pockets everywhere just celebrating that goal it's a brilliant goal from England Jude Bellingham takes the applause takes the congratulations from his team mates and it was the timing of his run talks about it before the game waiting outside the box waiting for the interchanger passing down the left hand side completely unmarked drifted the header wonderfully guided over Hussainy into the far top corner it paused time paused for a moment waiting for that to go in his heart would have been in his mouth for a moment but he would have known he would have known it's a brilliant header it's a fantastic goal he's bided his time Jude Bellingham this is his 18th cap for England and he's come close he's had the ball in the net I remember on at least one occasion but this one counts an England leader ran by one goal to 0 and let's get a view on it from Matt Upson from Pickside but all of a sudden John there's a crowd in the stadium isn't there the noise from my left hand side behind me was incredible all England fans up off their seat it was a really good goal actually I loved the pass of Harry McWale we have to give that a little mention I was perfect position behind the goal Kane now plays it forward but it just runs away just runs away poor poor from Iran losing it in that position but Mount couldn't reach the pass from Kane so it's back down to Matt yeah I was in a great position John to see the first pass from Harry McWale because really referenced that play around the left was really nice but he broke the lines with a really positive pass and I think it might have been Mount straight through the midfield into the front and the movement came off that so really good pass from McWale who's actually started really well it was interesting it was that position from Mount that he's been picking up and that interchange between him, Shore and Sterling I don't think Iran have really got an answer here they're not sure what to do who to go out when to go out so England leader ran by one goal to mill and their first goal at this World Cup coming in the 35th minute there certainly wasn't anything that Hussain Hussainy the substitute goalkeeper could do about it the arc of it was way over him and it dropped into the top corner she said Rob it seemed like time stood still before it actually found the back of the net and dropped in underneath the crossbar so the header across goal from what was he 7-8 yards out just got a nice twist of the head and a glance over the goalkeeper so Jude Bellingham the Borussia Dortmund man is on cloud 9 and here he is inside his own half great reaction from him as well to celebrate stood with his arms raised high I think he has been wondering we heard from him didn't we before the game talking about whether that first goal might come well it has as Kane inside his own half heads the ball on but it's struck an outstretched arm well that's been disputed by Chez Mee who runs past the referee pointing his finger but it is pre-kicked to England brilliant moment he knew the cameras was on it he posed for the photo thank you very much thank you world here I am announcing himself on the world scene what a moment so England with the pre-kick half way inside their own half great isn't it to do that as a 19 year old as we said since he burst onto the stage really he belies his tender years and remember he played at the Euros it's a 17 year old the first Englishman to do that either the Euros or the World Cup but now on his World Cup debut here Bellingham again playing the ball in towards the edge of the area Stirling playing in his third World Cup tries to give it back to Bellingham defender there with him kept in play but deflected out for a throw into the round just next to their corner just watching the body shape the body language of around now whether they can hold it together whether they can keep the shape because yes there's only seven minutes to half time but we'll have another good part of ten minutes on top of that is a big 15 minutes for them and then they scored goals in qualification 24 of them were against Cambodia in two games so stats are a little bit warped there it'll be interesting to see how they stay in this game if they can no disrespect to Cambodia yes all of them I couldn't name them any of their job but that's the footballing that's the footballing phrase to use in those circumstances he has Pickford who clears to the halfway line trivia pulls it down with his right foot nicely plays the ball over the top but beyond the run of Cain and advances through to goalkeeper Hussain Hussain and yes you know my mind actually goes back to 2018 England's first match there against another team in red and England dominated the early stages did get the early goal through Harry Cain but then conceded a penalty before half time and it is a rank coming forward and an intersection from Declan Rice inside his own penalty area and Maguire prevents it from going out for corner and England had the ball at the back and he has Luke Shaw the man who set up the opening goal incidentally with a very nice cross from the left hand side Luke Shaw playing it away and now where Mason Mount turns away from the challenge that comes in on him and Mount turns twists and sends a high ball out to the right hand side where trivia gets it down and passes it down into the full back position Sacker on the chase second favorite to win that and fell as sustain as he does so and it's a great kick to Iran in their own defensive third Now what are like with England at the minute what they're doing well is that they can go short and they can go long so when Iran do decide to press and they are depressing at times when they choose to go England can say right okay well we'll either play through you or that big switch is on or the long ball into Cain is on so Iran really stuck between a rock and a hard place do we drop do we go don't really know what to do so in theory we're in the last five minutes of the first half but we think that we've probably still got 15 minutes of time to actually play all there about Saka playing the ball back into the middle of his own half the floodlights now beginning to take effect and we can see the players shadows night falls very quickly in Doha so it'll be dark before you know it I suspect there'll be another lovely sunset tonight glorious sunset last night and here is Maguire with the ball in front of his own penalty area England leading through the Bellingham goal Maguire should have had a penalty he also had a header that hit the bar and Maguire now passing the ball forward to his Manchester United teammate Shaw and Shaw thought about the long pass but then actually plays it short instead and Harry Cain was back there and Cain just looks to his left and the amount is arriving so Shaw receives it from him and then it comes back again and England recycling back to the halfway line and now to the right hand side England have dominated possession but got the all important goal and here is Stones Stones just steps forward and takes it between two Iranian players and then rolls the pass out to Shaw on the left hand side and Shaw uses Raheem Sterling and England almost going through the card in terms of the number of players who've had a touch in this period of possession and it's gone from left to right to the edge of the box then back now to the centre circle and then a long pass hit by John Stones Shaw making good ground chest sit down but Moharrini was there for Iran but he's cleared it straight away and England now mounted inside the penalty area Sterling's after this but Moharrini is able to come across and slide it behind for another England corner so concerns for Iran here after the previous corners England have had yeah and you get the feeling England are enjoying themselves playing good football and they've got options they've got the long pass if they need it switch is on and you've got players that want the ball and playing it's a joy to playing and many it just looks like they're really getting ahead of us up its theme and enjoying it Shaw's going to take this corner from the far side so we need to keep our eyes on Stones and Maguire again who are near the edge of the area the two of them heading different directants Maguire is the target he's got his head to it and then it's driven in by Saka England score their second goal and are now in charge of this opening group match at this World Cup the Iranian players are protesting Maguire headed across the box to Saka but it's set up for him and with his left foot he drove it high into the Iranian net and now it's Bukhayo Saka and remember how things ended for him at the Euros in the final last year the absolute heartbreak and everything that followed and now in the very next tournament Saka scores for England in the opening match of the tournament in their group. Iran are continuing to protest about this they're all around the referee England have completed their celebrations but as far as we know it is England too around nil it's a brilliant strike top corner just clipping the underside of the crossbar sits up perfectly for him really intelligent header down from Harri Maguire he's got the beatings of his Barker, Cheshmeet in the penalty area he's arguing he was held down it won't get to overturn the referee he's saying get on with it it's a big big goal gives them that breathing space it's a really good goal a really good strike well play still has not resumed and the Iranian players are showing no great urgency to actually get the match back underway again they've got the ball in the centre circle and seem almost reluctant to put it on the centre spot and the referee saying to them come on kick off and they're almost delaying in the halt that somebody in the VAR centre one of his Brazilian colleagues is going to say actually we've seen the 36th angle of that and there might be an issue but Iran have kicked off they had to they couldn't leave it any longer and it's confirmed England lead Iran by two goals to nil and are in a very good position now fantastic position playing with real confidence they know they're the better team they know that they can play through the press they know they can go long they've got the answers it's just caping a foot on the gas and keep going strong because there's more goals in this for them so England win the fall back on the half way line Chezmi loses it, Ballingham strongly takes it on, finds Kane, Kane has a defender with him, Stirlings in the middle, Kane with the cross, Stirlings there! it's three nil, super finish on the stretch in the six yard box and England lead by three goals to nil, first Ballingham then Saka, now it's Raheem Stirling and England a buoyant and joyous here in the Alcalife stadium and they celebrate in the corner down next to the flag there's no arguing with that one it's brilliant from England just from the hold up Kane, play from Kane they go long initially, find the option Saka reads the knock down, Bellingham does so well to drive forwards with the ball and then Kane just a wonderful ball into Stirling really good finish with the outside of his foot but this was it, Iran know that they're beaten now they know that they can't have got the options they can't press high England utilising it it's a such brilliant effect two goals in the space of a little over two minutes towards the end of the first half we are in added time now at the end of the first period and there have been 14 minutes of additional time indicated so there will be a minimum of 14 minutes of added time after that horrible injury to the Iranian goalkeeper Alarazer, Baron van England now just want to make sure that they see this through to half time, well that's what we normally say when you're just in added time at the end of the first half there's actually still just a quarter of an hour to play and England win a free kick half inside their own half, well from an England point of view really on the pitch after everything that's been going on in the last 24 hours with the arm, band, gauge etc etc you know that was exactly what they needed in terms of turning their attentions back when that was on the pitch and what a good first half it's been for them let's get another view from that up so we haven't heard from that since England were leading 1-0 we will do in a moment long ball down field door for England which is headed away back to Stirling Stirling now gets it down and plays it square to Ballingham and Ballingham thinks about a shot, lovely change of feet though, leaves the defender on the ground but there were others there who join in and are able to take the ball away from Jude Ballingham but England now playing with a swagger rub green yeah real joy to watch, real pleasure and Matt just wondering there it was a length of the field move from right in front of you where you were how do you see it yeah it was just great move running off the ball exactly what Ballingham does what we spoke about in terms of his running from midfield and I don't know if John you want to hand over here yeah here come England down on the right hand side towards the byline but the referee says yeah it was a corner that Mohammed put in the challenge on Trippier and the final touch was off the Iranian defender so it is another corner for England from the right more from Matt in a moment or two that Trippier waits to take this from the right hand side we noticed as well after England scored their third goal the television cameras picked out David Beckham in the crowd Trippier to take the corner then but this one is headed away securely and that's the best defended set piece that we've seen from them so far Ballingham though as England take up possession again here is Raheem Sterling who's just scored his 20th goal for England and now it bounces down for Saka in the box Saka very nearly found the pass to the edge of the area where John Stones was waiting England come again they're looking for a fourth here Stones playing at the left hand side England coming into this World Cup really relatively unfancy generally even though they've been semi finalists and finalists at the last two major tournaments but this recent run of form six matches without a win I think that has influenced many and understandably so because some of the performances during that time but the majority of those performances were in those June games in the Nations League when many countries struggled this is very much set things back on course Rob Green so far absolutely and you just wonder that just in this 45 minutes so that they play with more joy and more pleasure and more attacking finesse than they did in all of those games put together and it's just been what they needed at the start of this tournament was against the opposition who thought they were going to be a lot tougher than they are just knowing that they're better team and got out and proven it so Bellingham Saka and Sterling the England goal scorers in a very impressive first half against what's looked like a very limited Iranian team after the great things that they did and how close they got to beat in both Spain and Portugal at the last World Cup as it turned out lost narrowly to Spain drew with Portugal and did go out at the group stage but here three nil down after losing the goalkeeper I mean you can't underestimate what an early blow that was his trip yet plays it forward but the balls cleared away on the edge of the penalty area and England will have it again inside their own heart so with Raheem Sterling with that goal that means that he moves on to the 20 goal mark which I think is quite a milestone isn't it to reach 20 goals for England 20 goals for your country and he joins Martin Peters World Cup winner of course and Jermaine Defoe on 20 goals for England and whenever Sterling has scored for England England has always won the match I don't know how Martin Peters will feel but I know Jermaine Defoe gutted about that here is Rice who plays the ball to the right hand side and now Trippie up in field towards Stones and Stones passing the ball to the left hand side and Sterling is there over on the on the touch line on the left wing comes back in field to Rice and then Trippie out in the space here space is opening up for England and now Sterling and now Saka again on the right hand side Saka is a little flick there by Mount looking for Saka who's almost done to that even though there were two defenders there and the ball bounces away final touch off Saka and behind for a goal kick so the score line is England 3 Iran nil just over 5 minutes to play they used to say about Martin Peters Robb that he was the player who was years ahead of his time I think it was 10 years ahead of his time Al Frams he used to say the much missed Martin Peters who's a real gentleman of the game as well but you know talking about that since that came to mind with Jude Bellingham scoring the all important goal of this match you know he's a player who kind of fits that same sort of bill isn't he? Yeah absolutely and he's added his first goal to his tally and you wonder how many he'll get close to that 20 of Martin Peters in the future Well he certainly can bring goals can't he and that is one of the things I know that Garasau wanted to see more off from this team to be less reliant on the goals of Harry Kane and to score more goals from the midfield areas England with it inside their own half we've now played 7 minutes almost 8 minutes of the 14 that have been added on at the end of the first half the other big question by the way that we've not it's not hardly the biggest question of this world cup by a long choke but what was Garasau's going to wear on the touch line at this tournament and the answer to that is he's gone for the dark suit again and that's what I was wearing at the end of last season and I think it's a kind of cream tolo shirt underneath that so that is what's happening in the fashion stakes the England manager fashion stakes here's Stones playing the ball out towards the left hand side Shaw keeps it in and then Raheem Sterling back it goes centrally and Stones wants more England have absolutely controlled the game Saka incomes the challenge and Iran win it back but Bellingham on the half way line to win it back and Rice is behind him and then Beccy goes to Trippier again and really from a position here 3-0 in added time at the end of the first half against this Iranian team it would be quite a stretch to think that this match will not end in an opening victory for England and I know I don't want to attempt failure but yeah no you can it they've announced themselves to the tournament and Matt I was just wondering whether you were thinking now it's just a case of keep ball really isn't it until half time as England play the ball out towards the left hand side and Shaw can't keep it in so it's a throw in to Iran in their own right back area let's see if we can bring in Matt Noobson from down behind the goal again Matt yeah I mean I can just feel the tempo dropping down here it's really noticeable I'm very close to the play and all of a sudden it's looking a little bit more like a just a practice match type tempo England very comfortable getting into half time in this situation we know they've got more goals in them if they push it but the tempo this game has really dropped and they're just able to stroke it about the confidence they've got going into midfield little triangles the space is there and Iran just aren't quite pressing as much as they were in the opening parts of this game that's the tempo what about the temperature incidentally Matt down there in fact we'll come back to you because Iran have won the ball back on the half way line England don't want any slips now in added time at the end of the first half but across from the left hand side and the space over there on the right hand side Jahan back pulled away that was a chance I mean that's Iran's only chance and he snatched at it and he hit it on the volley high over the top of Jordan Pickford's crossbar there's questions off offside but just get caught over playing in the central midfield I think he was offside breaking down the left hand side so it wouldn't have stood but they managed to get bodies forward options in the box and actually outnumbered England that's it for Iran for the whole of the first half really so it is England three Iran nil in added time at the end of the first half and as for how it feels down at ground level with so much talk about the potential heat that these matches would be played in Matt well it's interesting because I was talking to chapters before the game and he sold me a story about Ian Dennis getting beat root like on his head from a game in the Euros and I thought oh I bought the sun lotion the hat everything John and actually I'm sat here in my jumper and as the sun's gone in it cools it really does cool so in terms of the players they're absolutely fine I don't think he at this time of kickoff or later is going to be a problem thank you Matt, Matt Upsson behind the goal, England leading Iran by three goals to nil and just as Rob Green said sitting next to me just playing keep ball and you know so the England approach now bearing in mind that the next two matches in the group for England are 10 o'clock kickoffs here in Qatar so seven o'clock at home ten o'clock here in Qatar much later in the day are we looking now at an operation of conserving energy I think you're looking now and you'd say it wouldn't surprise me 15 minutes into the second half if substitutes are being made I think they've made the statement England have shown and found a way to play in this game against a team that sits deep they've come up with an answer it's about how many they get now how they can keep putting foot on the gas but I think it's down to Gareth Southgate and he's supporting backroom staffers to have the conversations at half time go right okay what's next England leading Iran by three goals to nil this is BBC Radio 5 live at the 2022 World Cup live in Qatar first of our commentary today's as Mason Mount is tripped for the umpteenth time it feels in the first half and wins a free kick 25 30 yards out and I think you know who might fancy a look at this one although actually Harry Kane has walked away from this I've seen him hit them from here before but he's had joy in the previous three kicks just drifting outside of the defensive line of Iran and you're looking now in again he's just drifted outside he's clearly been applied to say look we've got stones we've got Maguire you go one side I'll go the other and it's worked so free kick that's been talked about by Declan Rice is great friend Mason Mount he's shores there as well if you if you just switched on aware of the fact that it is afternoon time back home in the UK the England team that Gareth Southgate picked today has has delivered so far got this free kick sure plays it into the back post got a long way and in fact it bounced up it hit John Stones in the end who was able to get the ball and control quite cleverly actually gives it back to to Trippian and then through the middle to the man who started the scoring Jude Bellingham Rice now to the left hand side and sure Bellingham again first time touch quick passing you know that's another key with with this England team that's one of the messages that we don't always see delivered on the field and I think look sure's just taking a bang on the foot there or Mason Mount it is on that far side but he's OK going down and and then sure plays it back into his own half and Maguire has to come across and he I think was caught but he's OK and England have it inside their own half so we've now played almost an hour of the first half so we are almost at the point where these 14 minutes have at a time of being played and in fact there it is there is the whistle from Rafael Klaus the Brazilian referee what a start that is from England what a statement you have to feel for Iran I think the scenes before the match as well the conflicting emotions what happened when the Iranian national anthem was being played the Iranian players did not sing at all there was a mixed reaction to that inside the stadium they then had their hood all before the match you know clearly this is an emotional occasion for these Iranian players and then they lost their goalkeeper their important goalkeeper with a horrible looking facial injury looked like he broke his nose took an age for them to decide that he needed to come off the field which he clearly did but then England have just dominated it Beringham Saka and Sterling have scored the goals the second and third coming late in the 45 minutes and this is it's England's game Rob Green absolutely they've made the statement they've played some really good football scored three fantastic goals being clinical with their chances looked dangerous got options they've taken all the boxes around they seem overwhelmed by the occasion and they've been put to the sword yep stories all three of the goals Bellingham's first for England Saka scoring in his first tournament match after what happened at the Euros in the final last year and then Raheem Sterling with his 20th for England so at halftime here in the Khalifa stadium England lead Iran by three goals to nil and Mark Chapman is here with us inside the stadium yeah the goals have been a really good quality and they rob really really good one touch football for one clever header from Harry McGuire met with a wonderful volley from Saka and then Sterling finished off another fantastic length of the pitch move it just ticked all the boxes and they've come up with answers and they've really really enjoyed it you actually can't find a weakness in our first half performers can you Robert they've all contributed in some way yeah they've all contributed they've all played with confidence they've all played with an assuredness on that that it's not been picture perfect you wouldn't want it to be picture perfect all the time because they've got to take chances but when they have got it right they've looked really really dangerous all the England subs at the moment are out warming up Mark maybe with the hope that they're going to actually if they do get on they'll get a decent run at this because you would imagine given how comfortable it has been Southgate can make plenty of changes and make them quite early well Jack Greely shouldn't feel phoned and just volleying the ball between each other right in front of me and it's like I'm looking at those two they've watched that first half and must be looking at that thinking I can't wait to get on that pitch want to score want to be creative because you just feel that the spaces are going to open up chap as you know they look a little bit lost at the moment Iran and you think if England can just be as controlled the only thing that worried me was just that little period before that chance that your hand batch had we mentioned how it the tempo had dropped it got a little bit training game like it then came back after that chance and that's the only thing you've got to watch out for not to slow it down too much and just become too loose Danny Murphy part of our team in Qatar afternoon Danny. Jaffers how are you mate? I'm alright thank you what's stood out for you so far in that first half? It's hard to look past Bellingham I mean he's demanding the ball keeping the play going getting on the end of things mixing his play up dropping deep running forward off the ball the goal obviously that settles everyone down I think sometimes when you watch him play forget how young he is I mean there's been some good performances from there's not been any bad ones has there but he's just an exceptional young man quite it looks quite a balanced midfield that actually well it's the midfield I chose actually before the tournament I think the other thing as well of course is you've got two pull backs at the moment really comfortable in their own skin comfortable on the ball the distribution through the lines and I mean the shore from the cross from shore as well those bits of quality in wide areas it's just looks really nice and the tempo's been great that's the key isn't it when you play those teams that put everyone behind the ball it's moving the ball quickly and through the lines and forward and it's been pretty much perfect and as I was just saying to Matt it really gives Southgate options now doesn't it he could get quite well five of his squad if you want to he could get some minutes in them here at a World Cup give some of that starting eleven a rest he has real options now he really does that's a delicate one isn't it because I know Ari Kain won't want to be coming off that's for sure but if you think of someone like Declan Rice who's played nearly every minute for West Diamond for about two years hardly had a break that's the type of player I'd be looking at protecting but yeah in forward areas of course you wouldn't mean Saka maybe after 60-65 you know there's likes of Foden and Grealish and Rashford to come on why not you know why would you risk them in the first game I think it's just about choosing who's going to come off I'd be amazed if we didn't see at least three or four wouldn't you? Absolutely yeah Danny thank you very much Matt thank you Matt at the moment you're in a you're sort of in the middle of a light show at the moment they've pitched the stadium well they did pitch the stadium into darkness and put a sort of star and galaxy video on the as in the universe not the newspaper and the chocolate bar on the on a big screen and also that then goes across the top of the dugouts as well which have LEDs on them well forget sorry sorry Chappers forget the players trying to warm up for the second half it's more important that the advertising gets in isn't it? they actually they did they took all the players who were warming up had to go off as the stadium was plunging to dunes just one other serious point from that first half and I know it happened at the opposite end to where you were but even where you were you could see the force with which the Iranian keeper was hit by his own player and laid out really and for him to stay on after such a long stoppage as several people have pointed out you know Luke Griggs interim chief executive of headway UK somebody called NRL physio on social media as well it is a terrible look on the world stage for what looked like the player himself to decide to stay on even if it was for a minute just staying on is not good enough well there's not many better examples of a situation where a player needs to be removed immediately that was it that that was the situation and I understand this is a tough lad and obviously desperate to stay on the pitch but you cannot allow the player to make that call it's just impossible to put that on them so that in terms of the protocol every country must have understood what the moves are what's acceptable what isn't so I cannot understand and also I mean look what he's done to the game in terms of how it's dragged out that first half of the stop it has such a knock he restarted then we have to stop again and all of that it was just a mess wasn't it it was like they just didn't quite know how to handle that situation which is poor Luke Griggs went on to say and he's interim chief executive headway UK it was the first test of the FIFA World Cup Concussion Protocol and it was an abject failure still to come in this group this evening Wales against USA that gets underway at 7 o'clock UK time at 4 o'clock Senegal against the Netherlands and we'll have

chouhan was outside the ground what did you see we saw and it's safe to say hundreds of fans but Iran and England crowded around the ticketing centre trying to get in through the gate and when you look through the gate you could see even more and I spoke to an Iranian fan she'd flown in from Canada and she said that her ticket hadn't been activated on the official ticketing app as you mentioned and you know so this is linked to the higher up that's the same one that you used to get into the country you need to buy tickets book accommodation and she said that she'd been waiting there for two hours and you could see that the crowd were becoming increasingly frustrated we spoke to another England fan she'd kind of got in there earlier because she wanted to take in the atmosphere and now she's worried she's going to miss the national anthem and spoke to a guy called Ian from York who was absolutely raging he said it was an absolute shambles and we saw an official who was basically getting told on comms to redirect the fans to another gate and they had proof of their ticket like a photograph or an email and yeah so it was messy okay Ria thank you very much one line away from the

here at the Khalifa Stadium in Qatar the referee is ready to go John it would appear that neither centre players want to come out to do the second half no and I've spoken to a few of our colleagues at half 10 a number of whom have been suggesting well this could be a long second half now what are you saying what do you want? England are three nil up in the opening match of the world cup and now they're complaining that it's going to be a long second half but at some point that was made to me which I think is very valid is if you go back to the Harry Kane incident when he wasn't awarded the penalty early on in the match it's actually shades of what happened in Russia in the first match against Tunisia when England strongly felt that they should have had a penalty actually kicked up a fuss about that if you remember or at least you know went to FIFA and what happened in the next game England got two penalties against Panama yeah they did although it feels less of an issue doesn't it John because of this score line well yeah well it does but further down the line and I do feel that what we saw here with that insom rob kind of set the tone for the officiating and actually could cause something of a change because that will be widely discussed it changed in the half because then we had the goal that was scored from a Maguire knock down header and he was fairly unchallenged Maguire hit the bar as well where John Stones had a free run as well so all of a sudden the Iran players had to change they had to change immediately so they're right they made that point England have made the point it's only not an issue because they played so well and scored so many goals so yeah it's hopefully I'm looking forward to a long second half well I tell you what if some of John's colleagues feel it's going to be a long second half it might feel even longer for the Iranian players they're three nil down and they've made a triple substitution have you managed to note all that down correspondant I think so thank you very much for using the time there for me and the second half gets underway England leading Iran by three goals to nil and so these are changes number two three and four for Iran of course the first change Baron van going off in the first half was a concussion substitution but they've taken off Cheshmi, Karimi and Jahanbatch who had that late and only chance for Iran and they've brought on as the ball goes back to Jordan Pickford in the England goal he's playing the ball out to the far side but what I'll do is I'll run you through the England team again while they have possession inside their own half they are unchanged as they start the match with Pickford in goal, Trippier, Stones, Maguire and Shaw are the back fours Pickford was almost caught in possession clearing the ball away from near the foot of his left post but he was able to get enough on that and he's just one of the way they remind of Jardys foot or his knee as Iran win a free kick in the central third so the rest of the England team if you've not heard it, if you've just got back into your car, if you've been out at work today that back four, Trippier, Stones, Maguire and Shaw then in midfield Rice, Bellingham and Mount and then Saka on the right, Stirling on the left and Kane through the middle the three England goal scorers in that first half, Bellingham, Saka and Stirling and it is Iran who are in the red kit, shirts, shorts and socks with the white trim and white numbers there's all of those substitutes being announced over the public address system so I'm hoping still here is England playing early ball through the middle but that has dealt with and the ball is played out towards the right hand side to Mo Harami and Mo Harimi takes it on and gives it forward to one of the substitutes Ali Gholizada but Iran lose possession and now here's Saka on the right hand side, the ball is taken up for England by Kane who whips it across so that's headed away bounces around on the edge of the penalty area and then is bodied towards the half way line so yes the three Iranian players to come on Gholizada who's a forward player also Kan Aniz Adagan who is one of the central defenders the number 13 and in the midfield Said Ezatullah has come on in that position free kick two around halfway inside the wrong half Rob Green is with us here in the commentary position in the Khalifa Stadium Matt Upsson is behind the goal England will cut players both and England just standing off, do you think they might have made a change at half time just to leave it a little bit longer? No leave it a bit longer make sure to see it through to the hour mark then start looking ahead Well Kane slips the ball past the defender but then the challenge comes in on him slides in from it is a yellow card that is shown and I'm just looking at Harry Kane that was quite a heavy contact there and Kane has gone down and he is I think it's his ankle and Matt Upsson is behind the goal you'll have had a good view of that Matt when... Yeah, there's a play that came in with the challenge Yeah bang on John I was right in front of it and it was one of those tackles where Kane had got past the defender and the tackle came in kind of from behind all the side but the timing was really unfortunate because as he's foot got planted that's when the contact happened so he's a little bit caught in the turf and it's that right ankle and as we know in the past his ankles have been a little bit of a problem in terms of obviously the amount he must get kicked with Harry holds the ball up but that certainly was unfortunate the timing and he's gone down he doesn't look too happy No that's not a good challenge, poor Ali Ghanji it is who put in the challenge on him and the England captain has stayed down and has clearly felt that So this is a concern it's just outside the D on the edge of the penalty area Kane is now getting to his feet and he's stretching down, stretching his left leg and going down on his left knee while flexing the other leg forward. What do you think Rob? Well this is what we're talking about making the changes was that this was clearly the worry clearly the issue I mean if there's ever a warning sign that there needs to be changes made in the game where it looks like it's going to be a bit of a nothing second half or a second half where Iran are going to struggle to put up a fight then take off your main man because he is obviously such a big big big part of this England side Kane has been led to the side of the pitch and off the pitch having received treatment seems okay and he's walking now okay he's walking back towards the England coaching area absolutely massive coaching area and Gareth Southgate and Steve Hollung were at the other corner the opposite corner they're about 25 yards away from him So Kane is back on the field and it looks as though things are okay, Trippie with the free kick hits it straight into the wall comes back to the Newcastle man who tried to play it square and it was cleared away to the halfway line by Stones who will give it to Luke Shaw So England 3, Iran 0, this is BBC Radio 5 Live, live in Qatar at the World Cup and England coming forward again, Stirling with the back heel it bounces, oh that's it, that is a foul as well in the back of Trippie who was caught there from the challenge by Noura Lawheed and England have it again inside their own half, that looked like a poor challenge as well That was naughty, really naughty, late meant it and this is a danger of the second half being littered with fouls of Techey and Nigli half where Iran just don't want to have this second half of a free flowing game of football they want it to be grinding to a halt Matt you're just looking at the atmosphere and down on the pitch, you can almost hear the players now it's gone so quiet and it seems to be quite Techey down there Yeah it certainly is, I mean like you mentioned Iran are just not looking to get hold of the ball that much, they're just more concerned about stopping England having control and being comfortable and there's been two really late tackles, that one he just trod on the top of Kiering Trippie's foot just the studs on top of the foot, previous one obviously was a little bit worse in terms of it was Kane's ankle but maybe this is the issue that England are going to have in this second half just to try and keep fit and healthy move the ball quickly, I think it's the key, don't play any contentious passes if you need to be safe with it at times then do that and give your team mate plenty of time on the ball So Matt down at pitch side and Rob Green with me here, England on the defence here, Harry Maguire steps forward and then is able to clear it away and the ball is out of play on the fast side It seems like everyone stayed for the second half at least It does, good point Rob Today it was more of an issue for the England fans to actually get into the match as Iran come forward down the left hand side but the ball runs away and it was full kick for England that Tickford will look to take So Carlos Kieros has made four changes and England yet to make their first 3-0 the score, this is the first of our three commentary matches on 5-Live today if you're on your way home and have tuned into us on 5-Live, the next one Senegal Netherlands with Alistair Bruce Ball and Chris Sutton who will be in the Al Tumana stadium and then tonight the big night for Wales back in the World Cup, USA against Wales that is from 10 o'clock UK time with Ian Dennis and Dion Dublin in the stadium and James Collins back in the UK as England come forward down the right hand side and into the penalty arrow, Bellingham is doing well again, the ball is pulled across to the near post and it's tucked away behind for a corner to England from the right hand side but again strong play from Jude Bellingham who is one of the men of the night Yeah, such strong play and it's the right word because for someone who's so young just shrugging challenges off to make his way into the box and picked his pass, it got cut out in the end but that threat from just from every angle from England really that they've got so many options when they go forward, drive forward, play long forward it's just the choices they have, the things that cause around the problems Corner then for England, here it comes, Gorky Baceni comes, gets a punch on it in amongst a crowd of players comes out to the edge of the penalty area, the ball is won back by Rice, Rice then drives the ball across and it comes off the defend at Hayes Saffey, the captain and loops behind for another corner to England from the right 3-0 England lead Yeah, started up as we left off in the first half and making all those changes around, they can change the shape, they get the same shape but they're still coming up against the same problems it's not going to change anything, England are confident, they're on the ball, just trying to save themselves from a real beating The latest England corner, aiming for McGuire but it's over the top of him this time as he made the run towards the penalty spot from the far side of the box and England now start again, playing from right to left towards the end where most of the England supporters are, I think most of them were able to get into their seats, they eat ticketing problems before the match back it comes to Shaw, now here is Mason down with a cross, Hussain is watching it carefully but it was a comfortable catch for him backing away and the over arms it out, falls over as he does so he's managed to find Hayes Saffey but Bellingham was there with a cover and challenge and it bounced out of play so the Iranian team now look to take a long throw but England were alive to it and Bellingham is able to play the ball back although it's given away by Trippia and Iran look to perhaps create something on the edge of the England box but McGuire is able to step forward, take it away, give it to Sterling, now to Kane, lovely little flip from Kane back to Sterling it could open up for him to the edge of the penalty area but the covering challenge was there, Hussain he was coming across and was able to take the ball away off Sterling's toe and put it behind for a corner wonderful flow of move from Kane and Sterling and he's away, just never seemed to go and he got the return pass, never really seemed to have it under control covering tackle Kane in but again when they do want to, when they do get it right Iran just cannot live with England the Wales match tonight kicking off at 7 o'clock, so Senegal Netherlands 4 o'clock UK time, USA Wales kicks off at 7 o'clock UK time, 10 o'clock here in Qatar Shaw to take the corner from the left, Kane seems OK after that nasty challenge, by the way poor Ali Ghanji was booked for that challenge I can't remember if I mentioned that, the central defender, Shaw with the corner of the near post, Rice was after it but the defender was there as well Mount challenges for it on the edge of the area but that's a foul, he jumped into the Iranian player and it's a free kick on the edge of the box so the Iranian team now after the rejig, the multiple substitutions, substitute goalkeeper Hussaini, Moharami on the right hand side and then Kane and Izzard again, poor Ali Ghanji, Hussaini and Mohamedi and then in midfield as a Tole, a high saffie with Goli Zadar on the right, Noura Lohi on the left and Tarrami through the middle England in good shape, 3-0 up and the ball being played out from the back but it's intercepted, that pass forward from Harry Maguire and then a slip, Sako was very nearly onto it but Iran have got it back, there is a great brightness to a degree to Iran in the second half A bit of life, a bit of life that's come about, they just gradually got well on down in that first half, they've changed nearly half the team now so it's one that you'd hope there'd be a bit more urgency to them Both forward for Iran, Stoans was able to come across and find Maguire back to Pickford, Jordan Pickford tonight winning his 46th cap and then it's headed out of play on the half-way line for a throwing to England, Mason Knight just has a look, he's had some rough treatment in Mason Knight during the course of this match He actually continued the foul himself just a few moments ago but took a knock there as well There's a few now in the England team taking a few knocks which are at least Premier League worthy we'd say Well Harry Kane you know as is very well documented has had problems with ankle injuries but he was talking this season to us about how he's, you know, he has made great efforts and gone to get the best possible treatment and help that he can to improve that situation Bellingham playing it for Drasaka on the left-hand side, back to Sterling, Sterling couldn't find the past amount on the edge of the penalty area It was cleared away, the defender was able to step in, now it's hit long, downfield for Iran, Tarami is after it The referee has spotted an infringement, a handball and it's a free kick to England, 10 yards inside the run So almost 15 minutes of the second half played, so join us all the way through this World Cup I mean every match is on either five lives, sports extra, the world service as well But you know if you're on the move and I'm sure you will be during the daytime games there's every chance you will be able to listen to it all via BBC Sound So take the World Cup with you wherever you go on BBC Sound, as England, come forward with Saka Now here's Bellingham near the edge of the penalty area, comes to Shaw, he hits the shot, that's deflected into the box Only half cleared and then follied out of play for a throw into England, down the left-hand side here Dude Bellingham is everywhere, he's just patrolling the pitch, it just seems to be where the ball goes It's just him arriving there, whether he's covering in, defending, attacking, just seems to find he has that ability to be at the right place at the right time Well the hour mark is approaching and whether England are thinking about changes, there are in Golden Bibs There are three, four, five, six England players warming up there and the possibility, I'm sure Garos Southgate will use his full compliment here So one, two, three of the Golden Bibs might be coming on and the ball is out of play for a throw into England on the far side On the subject of substitutes, Matt Upsson? Yeah there's a few John, isn't there? Just getting ready, whether or not the, you can always tell because the little bit of tempo, the warm up just kicks on a little notch When you know a player's had a little word in their ear, there's been a member of staff out of the England team as well Just keeping an eye on some of the players, having a little chat with them, whether or not he'll be the person to let them know But I'm with you and Greeny thinking that a change must be imminent Iran coming forward and a shot from way, way out actually which I thought might have taken a little deflection there But no, there's no suggestion of it and that effort was well wide of the mark from Esatolle so it's a goal kick to England So three-nil it is and England's next matches, in case you're thinking ahead The program is, England's next match is on Friday against the United States, that's at 7 o'clock in the UK And then the Wales game is on the Tuesday night at the same time so England's next two matches kick off 7 o'clock in the evening, UK time Ball is back with Gulki bat Hussaini down to our left, just bounces the ball on the ground And I think the discussions might be taking place but it looks as though perhaps the next change is going to be another Iranian change Here Sterling, centrally, he's tackled but rides the challenge nicely, gives it to Saka on the edge of the box, into the area now on his left foot Trying to find a position which he does and shoots and scores and it's 4-0 to England And Bukhaya Saka has got his second of the match, this is a great story Bukhaya Saka, one of the Gareth Southgate favourites, think of everything that happened to him last year at the end of the final of the Euros When he ended up in Gareth Southgate's arms in tears and now here on the big stage again at the World Cup Two goals in the match and England leader and there are about four goals to nil He's had so much joy down that right hand side in this second half and again it's wonderful play from Sterling just to hold the ball up Ride the challenge, take the flow for the team and then from there backing off, backing off, back just one, you can't defend like that I was right behind the strike and I think they actually made Saka's mind up to be honest because he came in I think he was looking to offload the ball because it was a bit closed but he just saw, Iran just weren't coming out And he thought, OK I'll have another touch inside, have another touch, the distance was there And when you hit into bodies, I mean you as a goalkeeper, Rob will know, it's the hardest shot to save isn't it The deflect and any kind of nick on the way through from any player is a major problem, that was quite a big deflection But well played to Saka for just being positive Yeah I mean, Hussainy there, you look at his reaction, he's just looking to turn to defend as he's planting his hands together to say get tight, get tight He's got all the time in the world, I don't think he ever really got the ball out of his feet And it wasn't the greatest of strikes, he will not care England 4, Iran 0, Carlos Keros has made what is his fifth substitution while England were celebrating Now the left back, Millad, Mohamedi has come off and Mehdi Torabi has come on to replace him So England leading 4-0 in their first match at a World Cup and at least two England substitutes are now preparing to come on As England take possession back on the edge of their own penalty area It is three changes coming very shortly, so Callum Wilson is coming on Marcus Rashford as well as Iran have to clear from near the edge of their own penalty area And Phil Forden also, but Iran coming forward trying to vainly try and get something to take away from this match Cross from the right hand side but straight at Harry Kane who's able to clear it The ball coming in from Nur-Alahi on the right flank, it's out of play I'm not going to say the change is yet, I think it's going to be a quadruple change rod But Jack Drealish, just keep coming and coming So four of a merge from underneath the big narrow wide red roof of the England dugout I think it is going to be just before at the moment What a luxury this is for a manager in his opening match at a World Cup to be able to do this Particularly here in the Gulf with the conditions that have been so well documented Iran have this throw in, the ball slipped through into the penalty area and a chance here And it's a goal, brilliant finish, Terebi has scored it It was slipped into the penalty area beautifully by Goli Zadda Lovely play from him on the edge of the box, but the ball was played through And Terebi of Porto was onto it in a flash and that's an excellent finish actually Higher book Pickford, Iran have got a goal, but England lead 4-1 Yeah he's a player of real quality, he's had so little in the game But it is Goli Zadda, on the edge of the box with a clever play Just lends the ball into it, asking the run to be made Drift round the back of Harry Maguire, John Stones can't get round It's a brilliant strike from 9 yards in off the underside of the bar Harry Maguire has now gone down injured, not sure why, but just a moment's early lapse from England And he'll need to wake up from that He's looking at Maguire, trying to work out what happened there Whether he's fallen off quickly England are going to make their changes, but just waiting to see what the situation is with Harry Maguire Before they do that The board is being brought forward by the fourth official The four England men are waiting there This might be a bang on the head as well for Harry Maguire Ditching by what the England medical team are doing One of them is crouched in front of Harry Kane and holding up his index finger And doing the follow my finger with your eyes I don't know whether I'll shoot just a trailing arm from Tareemmi that calls him From the strike on the goal It seems to have taken a blow I think it's on the cheekbone, checking around the eye socket It's something they're taking every precaution with As we saw in the first half where maybe you're wondering they were taking a chance with it Harry Maguire it is by the way, I might have said Harry Kane there But Harry Maguire it is, he's sitting on the ground having taken a bang on the face Not yet making the changes because it might be In fact Eric Dyer has now actually been called forward instead So it looks as though it's Eric Dyer who's going to come on And while we have yet another stoppage in this match but an important one nevertheless Another thought from you Matt Upsen down behind the goal Yeah well it was just one of those moves where the board had popped in And we just switched off for that momentary second And when you do we play as Lai Tareemmi who you know he's been the real danger man He's made a nice little diagonal run and it's tough for a centre back Because you lose that player on your right and you know it's a straight pass on the left hand side of you And Maguire just couldn't adjust to it, it was a nice run, really well timed Maybe just identifying that a bit earlier and getting your body in to try and block that passage way But nice move from you Ron Is that a lack of game time Matt? Has that, you know, he hasn't played as much? Yeah I think a lot of it is starting position as well though Rob In terms of knowing where Tareemmi is, seeing where the ball has just popped into All of a sudden that adjustment has got to be quicker, either just drop straight off Shuffle your positions to try and cut out the pass, almost gamble sometimes if you're in trouble But you know it was nicely worked, it was a nice timed run and the finish was excellent Harry Maguire has been led away off the field but England have not been able to bring on Eric Dyer For which he's had a word to say it before the official there And I think that they're saying we weren't able to get what the paper worked on I'll get the electronic board sorted out so England are playing with 10 men at the moment Jude Bellingham's had to drop in alongside John Stones in Central Defence The fourth official has not many jobs and one of them isn't the board to hold up for the substitutes And he didn't have one so he can't come on And Steve Holland is not best pleased about this and understandably so England four, Iran one, England in the FA of course not in the best of humour with FIFA After the events of the last 24 hours and the armband for our goal So Jude Bellingham at Central Defence, wins ahead, gets up and heads it away in stately fashion But against the 10 men currently, Iran are coming forward and they're looking for a second goal And here's the ball on the right hand side, the defender falls over And it's played back towards the edge of the box but the shot is blocked It comes out and then with his left foot a stretching effort is sent well-wired by Noura Lohi And it is a goal kick Wow, this is a mess because England need to get Eric Dyer on the pitch And they're all a bit all over the place because Bellingham have done the right thing and dropped it into centre half But no one had dropped into the midfield so there's a great big hole there Iran has exploited it, it's become a little bit messy The Iran fans have got the voice back and it all seems a little bit out of control from England for a few moments But the subs are coming on now which will inevitably take its toll on the game and die it down again Well that's been the worst five minutes of the World Cup so far for England conceding the goal that Tarani scored And then Kiran Tripier rather comically fallen over actually as Iran attacks He tried to twist around, lost balance, fell over inside the box and then Iran ended up with a shot on the England goal But now we're going to see the rest of these substitutions So Eric Dyer's on to win his 48th cap for England, missed the Euros, wasn't selected But of course played such a big part in the World Cup in Russia four years ago Jack Grealish is on to his 25th cap, Phil Forden also under the field to win his 19th cap for England And Mason Mount has made way and who is the other player who has come off? It is Marcus Rashford who is on So Marcus Rashford makes his England comeback as Shaw is able to turn and give the ball back to Pickford So here tonight in Doha Marcus Rashford now gets his first touch of the ball and he's into the area and he slips it in Left-footed finish, a fifth goal for England and Marcus Rashford who's been out of the England picture completely Since the final of the Euros last year, instantly back into the action here in Doha and scores What is his 13th goal for his country and England lead 5-1 against Iran in their opening group match That's a dream start for Marcus Rashford, first touch of the ball, driving into the box You're thinking he's going to shoot but he's strong, the right foot, cool as you like, steps inside Garry Southgate wanted more goals from away from Harry Kane and we've got them tonight It's a brilliant play from Harry Kane to hold it up, lay it off and that just as simple, looked like a simple finish but he made it look simple Matt, what about your view of that? England fans in Dreamland behind me here, John really getting behind that, you can tell they're all pretty relaxed now and enjoying the game But I thought it was all about the contact that Harry Kane made just before he controlled it Look over his shoulder, saw the centre half, just stepped into him, took that contact, just bumped him And the touch out of the sky, well it was absolute world class, set the whole chance up and then it was a simple pass wide Let Marcus Rashford do his thing but the ability for Kane to know his surroundings, know the centre half there Using just to take that contact and then have the touch was absolutely brilliant Well there we are, Rashford makes it 5-1 to England, so Marcus Rashford scores on what is Monday the 21st of November 2022 The last time he kicked a ball for England was when he hit the post with the penalty last summer in the European Championship Final Form injuries have played a part in that but he's not got onto the field for England since that day, that day of the final Well if Gareth Salsgate was looking for things to happen in this game, what do I need to happen? That was one of them and he'll feel back at home, back involved and scoring in a well cut, I'll take that away from him now Another assist for the Harry Kane but not a goal yet, England score 5 goals in their opening match at the World Cup and Kane doesn't get any of them It's a drought, it's a official drought Are you worried Gareth? Should that be my opening question? Please, please, I don't know, if we could see his picture of his face when you get a response that would be great England 5, Iran 1, we'll try and bring you live interviews from down in the dressing room area but I'm conscious of the fact that we will be pretty much straight into Senegal, Netherlands Which kicks off 4 o'clock UK time and we'll have commentary on Senegal, Netherlands from 4 o'clock and then USA, Wales from 7 o'clock And then you'll be able to have your say on 6-0-6 by the way after that, double Chris Sutton today, double Sutton They'll be on from 10 o'clock to take your calls on 5 live before it all begins again tomorrow in the morning with Rick Edwards who's here with us in Doha I don't know whether you've crossed paths with him yet, Rob I will be tomorrow morning Good, excellent, excellent, pleased to hear about that So, 6am every morning, 5 live breakfast from here in Doha and take the World Cup with you all day long on BBC Sounds on your device I hope the app works better than the ticketing app that FIFA had in operation for this match tonight that caused problems for the England fans before the game Callum Wilson is now going to come on and make his World Cup debut and it is Harry Kane who will make way so no goals then for the captain In the opening match there was a worrying moment when he sustained that, looked like an injury from the poor Alligangie tackle But that is it and he's handed the arm band around and on comes Callum Wilson then so this is nice as well Callum Wilson who won his first cap back in 2018, scored on his debut against the United States But has been out of the picture for three years so it's his first cap for England for three years And it is his fifth in all So Callum Wilson on for Harry Kane to have a go in the number nine position up front So England leading around by five goals to one Down to side to Matt Upsen I just wondered if anyone surprised that Drew Bellingham hasn't come off at all I mean he's everywhere and he just see him turn with the ball then he got clumsily tackled from behind And that for me is the biggest concern looking at this game at the moment, he's been so good and he's putting so much energy into this game You almost kind of want him to get him to stand still or just let him have a rest and take it easy for a bit Now going into the game he wasn't asserted for the start in 11 but after this performance today He's kind of looking at it thinking there's no way, there's no way you can take him out the team now So five-one and this if it stays like this this will be England's most handsome victory in an opening match at a World Cup But the ball is played through and Terini is in again but this time as he ran away from Eric Dyer on the edge of the penalty area into the box The ball sort of bounced away from me rather slashed at it and hit it well wide, goal kick There's a good long straight ball down the channel and he's onto it The ball stems from Drew Bellingham having the ball and firing it into Phil Fody It's a great pass, it's lending in the ball, I'll give you the ball, I'll trust you with the ball And it wasn't a great touch from Phil Fody, he lost it, England were open Another sub for Iran Well this is interesting because it's Asmun who is coming on, Sada Asmun who was at out with the calf injury, the Bayal Evekouz and men And he's been quite outspoken against the Iranian regime, against the government there And when he ran onto the field there were clearly whistles and boos from the Iranian section there So that mirrors the kind of thing that we saw before the match when there was whistling and booing from the Iranian supporters When their players did not sing the national anthem But he's onto the field, one of the most important players, third on the old time list of Iranian goal scorers in international football But England now he has Phil Fodyn, one of the England substitutes and he gets the ball back on the right hand side And he's looking for Rashford who's already in the goals, Fodyn This is classic Phil Fodyn, twisting, turning, all business, full 360 degrees Then finding his Manchester City teammate, Grealish, now it's back to Rashford on the right hand side, poor opponent of the penalty actually by Rashford And it bounces away in England, Iran are able to clear away, two Bellingham So all of the changes have been made, now that's five changes In actual fact he might have one more left, might be because of the Harry Maguire concussion injury The official attendance was announced there, just missed I'm not sure we're able to pick it up in that language, whatever that was It didn't matter what language it was Inaudible in any language That's a good point, yeah Anyway, in the international language of football, England lead Iran by five goals to one And he has Rashford with it near the centre circle, back to Rice and then back to Stones in the centre circle So the goal that Terrami scored is a little blot on the copy book So after the five consecutive clean sheets to start the Euros last year, that won't be happening But other than that, no it's been plain sailing and looking at Iran and saying Right, okay, in terms of progressing in the group, saying it was the most even group The two other teams, Wales of course and the USA will look at this and think Well we can get at them because not, yes they put up a fight for a moment in the first half But you forget in there that there was a 15 minute delay from the keeper's injury And actually it was all plain sailing fairly early in the first half They've had a terrible game around I think it's been tough and you just sense that it's been a step too far to go on to the pitch as well A little bit like yesterday, though, the discussion that followed that match The Ecuador game, you know, how much was it a case of Qatar not performing How much was it a case of Ecuador performing Well I think with England here, they really have performed We've got a stoppage at the moment incidentally, there's another one On the far side, it is Haissafi, the captain who seems to have gone down with cramp When he was about to take a throw in, so I think this might, this could set a world cup record For the longest amount of minutes played in a match that was due to last 90 minutes After 14 minutes riled on at the end of the first half We need Stapman, Dave, we need... Where is he? He's not off when I say that I think he might be on the world cup daily every night Excellent, well there's a question for Dave, get on it, let's find out I don't know whether he does that one Stop criticising Keaters Right, Haissafi has sat down now on the far side I mean he could have taken one step off the pitch on the far side and let play continue But they weren't going to do that So another lengthy stoppage, so what's in your mind Matt Upson down there in your jumper? I'm thinking it's quite a wily piece of play from the Iran left back Because you're absolutely right John, he just knew he was off the pitch He almost like kind of just stepped on, went down on one knee Looked like he was adjusting something, didn't know what was going on But it looks like it's good old fashioned cramp I just want to see England control and see this game Keep everyone healthy, keep everyone fit Don't dwell on the ball too long, allow a late tired tackle come in and catch anyone Do it properly, move the ball quickly, see it through and then reflect on what's been a pretty good performance It has, just a few months after the hostile crowd at Mollinieu We're telling Gareth Southgate that he didn't know what he was doing Here we are watching the first match of the World Cup And Gareth Southgate's team are winning 5-1 And this will be a record win for England in their first match at a World Cup Their biggest margins of victory in their opening matches at any World Cup I'll run you through in a moment But England looking for another one, trying to match the record 6-1 against Panama in Russia But Iran are able to win the ball back but Eric Dyer is able to step across So England's biggest wins in their first match at a World Cup You have to go back to 1982 when France were beaten 3-1 in Bilbao In the match that Brian Robson scored after 27 seconds Or all the way back to 1954 when England beat Belgium 4-2 after extra time in their first match at the World Cup So 2-goal margin is the record and currently it is 5-1 So this is some way to get out of that slump of form in inverted commas The 6th match run without a victory for England Which was the longest run that they'd gone on without a win since 1993 5-1 the score, this is BBC Radio 5 Live Live in Doha in the Khalifa Stadium, Thordon, Knights from Hymn, sticks his chest out Gets the pass with his left foot to the right-hand side Actually over-hit to Rashford but Rashford's onto it into the penalty area Beats two men, shoots left-footed, deflected across the penalty area That would have been a corker if he'd scored that Rashford Brilliant bit of skill, brilliant think And here's Thordon now Englander on to win again Ball slipped through from him into the penalty area, Wilson was after it But Defender got there and helped it behind and it's an England corner This England side is just so athletic They've got so much pace and so much ability to cover ground This is something that Iran haven't been able to live with Not only just going towards your end goal but when they clear it They can cover the ground, they just cannot live with them all over the pitch So it is a corner for England from the left And they've caused problems with almost every set piece that they've had So don't rule out another goal yet Sure, this one's a deep one towards the back post No Maguire on the field anymore, Defender got a touch to that Two men have gone down, there might have been another clash of heads in there The referee's blown his whistle, I think it's the Defender who has come off worst And we're just hearing a reaction from the Iranian supporters to our right And Carlos Keros with his team 5-1 down has walked right across the technical area And is blowing kisses to the Iranian crowd And I guess he's thanking them for their presence Probably in the circumstances with what's happening in Iran He's got a long association even though he's just taken over again as the coach of Iran He was saying to them, I guess, just thanks for being here Despite what's happened on the field, as Grealish now scampers away from two or three challenges Then plays it through to Rashford, now it's back to Bellingham And these substitutions that Garrel Southgate has made have really revitalised England You've got hungry England players here against the tired and tiring Iranian side And they're looking for more goals, no question There's four attacking changes, wasn't it? And people have got their own ideas of what they want to do They want to hit the ground running themselves, they want to get a goal And Rash has already done so Just wondering, Carlos Queeras went all that way over He was still a good 20-30 yards away from the fans so he was fairly safe Long way to go, 69 Here's Grealish back to Rashford Rashford now out to the right-hand side And Thordan has continued his run down into the full-back position And here is Grealish again on the right-hand side, Jack Grealish Is able to play it back towards the edge of the penalty area Comes back to Rashford, now Grealish again on the right Little ball into the penalty area, Thordan with a flick Rashford just ran away from him but it runs to Shaw And back to Rashford once more on the edge of the D And they will play it back to Declan Rice, who actually is dispossessed So Iran are going to break away downfield And play the ball out towards the left-hand side to Goli Zadda And now he finds his pass cut out by Tripiak And it's a throw into Iran down the left, 5-1 Englandly Good for Tripiak to get the block in Momentarily laps from Declan Rice But again England, when they attack with the pace And the skill that they have and Boudin and Grealish get going As Iran play a shortish pass back to Golkeepa Hussaini He was able to get out of his penalty area and clear it And they couldn't keep it in on the far side So throwing to England So we're in the 87th minute And it is a free kick to England A throw into England on the far side that they take So the goal scorers tonight for England, Bellingham Got the ball rolling with that excellent header Two goals for Saka, one in each half, one for Sterling And then one for Marcus Rashford on his England return And England with the ball inside their own half The curving roof of the stadium above, floodlights brightly on It's got a couple of arches this stadium, yellow lights are on on that And the ball is played forward by Shaw But the goalkeeper is able to come out and claim that And I think some people are now making their way home I think it's not quite as full as it was The ball is played back to Golkeepa Hussaini who clears But I don't think any of the England fans who are here have left yet They'll be waiting to give this England team an ovation After what is going to be a record win for their first match at a World Cup Absolutely, and it's as a spectacle You can understand the people leaving now It's been over for quite some time But the way that England played and attacked at times Has been why people have turned up And why they've been a really, really confident win There was that slip with the goal On that, just the momentary few moments Around a cause problems, mainly due to England Their own, the product of their own downfall But really on the whole a really confident and consummate performance Great start for England at this World Cup And they'll feel a lot better about themselves And actually in some ways it's been a step back into the qualifying campaign And putting away a poor team which Iran have been today And remember, they racked up 39 goals in that qualifying campaign Which was a record, record for England in any World Cup Or European Championship qualifying campaign But you know, many people would say Well, look at the standard of the opposition And when it comes to England playing the better teams They're not able to do that But listen, as Jimmy Armfield always used to say to us You can only beat the team that's in front of you In England have beaten this or England team well I was trying to think of something really hard different to say than that But yeah, and it was, I think, looking at the Garos Southgate now And you'd say, well, in the games in the future Making the salves and things like that The second half has been a pretty slow pace And having them playing the ball through for Wilson And it's reached Wilson, and Wilson now into the area Placing across, Grealish! It's 6-1, what a start for England in Doha And Jack Grealish joins the party now To score only a second goal for England That'll mean a great deal to him His first at a World Cup on this stage And his team mates are surrounding him in England Match what they did to Panama in Russia four years ago They're winning 6-1 here against Iran By the time he's run to perfection Callum Wilson And from a man coming onto the scene In his first World Cup game To have the opportunity to score But to have the awareness to play the most unselfish of balls square To Jack Grealish And it all stems from Jude Bellingham's through ball And that man has been a revelation tonight If you didn't already know about him Well, Marky Card, he's on the scene Jack Grealish has absolutely loved that moment You were right next to the celebration down there on the floor He was probably 15 yards away from the celebration Yeah, it was nice, good spirit amongst the group Declan Rice coming over, having a little word with Jack Grealish Loved every minute, his eyes lit up, John I cannot tell you, I was kind of on the angle And I was just fully expecting Callum Wilson to shoot Just because of the stage of the game You've come on the score line With fair play to him That is what Garry Savka will be so happy with That kind of collective play of being a team Identifying somebody else's in a better position to score And being unselfish is a really good asset for a team to have And for him to have that in that position Fair play to him, but Jack Grealish's eyes were just lit up completely With the opportunity just to tap that in Yes, thank you Matt Matt Upsen down on the touch line Rob Green with this year up in the commentary position I can think of at least one Newcastle United number nine That might not have done that As the ball's played towards the edge of the penalty area Shaw takes it down And England have it comfortably on the edge of their own penalty area Just knocking it around, this is party stuff now Just triangles around the Iranian players Jack Grealish, by the way, it's a second goal for him For England In his twenty-fifth appearance That's a little bit of a milestone isn't it? The quarter century, his only other goal was in Andorra When we were there in the October of last year In the qualifier, he scored in the five-nil win What a contrast that, scoring in Andorra to scoring here And the heat of the action at the World Cup Well, he talked about Jermaine Defoe scoring twenty goals earlier He had won against Andorra, nicked away I remember David Nugent running onto the line As the ball was going over and he kicked it in And David Jermaine Defoe was fuming That was the complete opposite A real opportunity to score for in a World Cup And you turn around and you go, there you go mate, you can have it Well, we've got only ten minutes of added time at the end of the second half So... Stapman, Dave's got his work cut out later I think that is that, can we play you every week from the England supporters? That's a little unkind isn't it, to around when you think of the backdrop to this game for them But you can't question their enjoyment of this, the England fans What a start really, sixth one in your first match Here is Foden, now Bellingham To Grealish on the left hand side, Grealish with the headband on Hairst swept back, Bellingham now who I think is likely to get all of the praise and the awards for Man of the Match Bellingham flicks a header on down for Grealish who is in the right back position Just keeps it in play with the outside of his right heel And then uses Bellingham who is in close quarters And then Bellingham curls it in, but it curls it all the top of Wilson and into the arms And it will keep that for singing Now slightly harder pass than the one that Callan Wilson set on a plate for Grealish moments ago But it's just in this midfield with Rice and Bellingham where Iran have been pulled all over And because the midfield has been so stretched and so overrun by those two in particular They've become such a big gap between the midfield Attack and the defence, the runners of England have had a real pleasure to play in that So 6-1, if you've just switched on to us on 5-5 This is the last knockings of this opening match for England in this group The opening match in Group B, this is the group, the only group in which all four teams are in the top 20 of the World Rankings Grealish has bundled over right in front of Carlos Kieros I think you have to qualify this because of what is happening with Iran in the build up What's happening at home and also the fact that Carlos Kieros coming in only 74 days before the World Cup began I think also for the sakes of them and the group itself that they put in more of a performance that we know they're capable of That's the next match in Group A, next, Senegal, Netherlands And then that's 4 o'clock kickoff, UK time And USA, Wales at 7 o'clock, UK time How far away is 4 o'clock? What time is it? I've totally lost track of this So it is now just after 6 here, so we've got just under an hour, is that right? Before kickoff, yes, just under an hour before that match kicks off And in that time, we'll try and bring you interviews from down in the dressing room area We've got our high tech equipment set up down there that I hope is going to work As Iran have the ball in the central third and then play it back into their own half, but understandably looking Really a little bedraggled now, as you would coming to a World Cup with all of the hopes that any footballer would have to be 6-1 down in the first match Ball in from the left-hand side, Teremias after it, couldn't get his head to it And it was nodded away, it comes out on the right-hand side, Moharini Left-footed ball across the edge of the box, Asmun was after it But England are able to win back possession and suddenly they're on the halfway line with Foden But Foden overhits his pass by a distance through to Gorky back, Hosseini So we've had 5 minutes, 5.5 minutes of the 10 that have been added on There will be discussions as well about that decision for goalkeeper Beren van to play on in the first half Harry Maguire has gone off to the concussion injury as well, it would seem so, we'll have to see how he is But here is Iran coming forward, but Pickford gives a big shout there to Eric Dyer who is able to head the ball down and away Grielish, oh he's caught late there, he caught late, that was a very late challenge Played the ball away, but he knew it was coming I think so, was off the ground by the time the impact was made on him Yep, could ride it, games lost all shape now, lost all any sort of pattern, it's just, if you want to get it and you can run with it And you've got space you can do and that's what Jack Grielish is like That was Puerh Ali Ganti who fouled Grielish there, who was on a yellow card That was a second yellow card, yep, that should have been a red The referee has been extremely lenient there on him, there's Iran when a free kick inside their own penalty area I think it just sums up where they've been, a yard off the pace with the game really and it's been too much, Puerh Ali Ganti And he's, not for the first time like you say, almost with Harry Kane trying to chase him Now with Jack Grielish arriving late, he's not on his own, he's been a yard off it Well I know that wise football watchers will be thinking that the pre-tournament form means nothing It's what you do when you get here and as Gareth Southgate was saying in advance of this and indeed every tournament that he's been at That is how you will be remembered, that is your, as they like to call it these days, the legacy The legacy of any manager, any international manager is how your team performs at the tournament You can break all the records you want and qualify really, Iran, as the balls played through And this could be a chance for a second Baranian goal, but the crossbar is struck And what an opportunity that was, one on one with Pickford and it was the Bayal Evekouz and man Asmund with the chance he was put through That should have been a second Iranian goal and I think Pickford might have got a touch to it onto the bar That's a fantastic save, that's a terrific save Waited and waited and waited and Asmund had all the time he wanted to pick his spot and as he goes down You can't leave your trailing arm to stay high and you can react above you And he did that, it's a wonderful touch and Jordan Pickford has had so little to do You think he's been stood out there for nearly two hours now It's been so long to keep your concentration like that Just a little slit from England, John Stones this time not tracking It's a good question, how long is this match now? If we had 90 minutes then they added on 14 in the first half And now we've had another 10 It's a free kick though to Iran on the right hand side, just work that out well while I'm doing this It's a free kick that is going to be taken in from the left hand side by Hayesafi the captain So Pickford, you know, he'll feel he's contributed now, having conceded the goal that Tareni scored Very good save, Hayesani plays this in, Pickford comes and gets a punch on that And that was a good delivery actually by Hayesafi into the edge of the six yard box And Pickford came, players were arriving, there's a little bit of a dust up And the referee's blowing his whistle And actually Jordan Pickford of all people, the once excitable Jordan Pickford Actually stepped in there and gave it the calm down, calm down everybody, what was the thought? Well the temp is afraid and the run into the box, they're just clashing the ball, he's a push Ref's now having a whirp, he's been in the rumbling on in the background all the game hasn't it The arguing, the late tackles, the petulance has been there, it's just England have been so good in the second sense And blown Iran away, this is what they would have wanted for 90 minutes or however long it's been Well there's no need for this now, the referee has called all the players and they're having a look at the AR Actually so there must be a chance that this is a penalty, that something happened in the midst of that When the free kick was played in by Hayesafi, that maybe one of the England players is either committed or fell Or perhaps the way that they reacted inside the penalty area So the referee's coming across, we know what normally happens here So there is a review for a possible penalty, we're seeing the replays now These are the replays that the video assistant referee will be watching Well there's a tug of the shirt from John Stones which is a problem, it's weathered on poor Ali Ghanji So he did, he's got a handful, he has a handful of poor Ali Ghanji shirt, John Stones But it's weathered, the reaction of poor Ali Ghanji is warranted from the target For me there's not a big tug in there, I think he realises he's not going to win the ball Well that could be given as a penalty, because he's got the shirt, he's pulled the shirt The referee's had a look at the screen down between the dugouts, here he comes, I think we're going to see the rectangle Any moment now, yeah there it is and the penalty is given And after England, we're not given what looked to me a stone wall penalty for wrestling inside the penalty area Yeah there is gross inconsistency here in that Iran have been given a penalty, but this for a shirt pull Well there is a pull, it's debatable as to whether it's enough to bring a player down, that's debatable But the referee clearly didn't see it, what was checked and what was seen was the rugby tackle in the first half of the penalty So it is going to be Metti Tarami with his chance to score his second goal of the match So the Porto striker standing on the edge of the box, Jordan Pickford with his excellent goal, penalty saving record He's jumping up, star jumps on the line, Jordan Pickford, remember those saves and the penalty shoot out at the end of the Euro final He's already made one brilliant save to keep out Asmune in the last few moments, but now deep, deep, deep in added time A chance for Iran to score their second goal of the match, won't affect the outcome But Tarami waits, there's the whistle, still he stands on the edge of the D, still he stands on the edge of the penalty area in the D Still he waits, and now final, little steps, little steps on the spot, and now he begins his run up right footed And he sends Jordan Pickford the wrong way, Tarami has scored his second goal of the match, Iran have scored two But England lead six-two, and there can only be seconds left of the match It's been a bit of a strange ending to the game, and that adds to it really disjointed He's being able to attack at will, and then from there that goal, from the free kick, eight-tug on the shirt, not seen by the referee, then given We've seen worse in this game, but weren't given, so all very up So England six, Iran two, is the final score, there is only just time for England to kick off, and six-two is the final score That's tennis, not football, it's been a strange game and a bit over-wrought So Iran from the kick-off, England were too good, and then from there in the second half it lost all shape, it lost all semblance of a real competition And realistically it's been a strange score line, actually in total 11 shots on target, eight goals, it kind of sums it up really A great start for England, a great start in terms of performance, in attacking sense, that's where we looked, bereft of ideas in the games, in the build-up games in the recent past And all of a sudden six goals, plenty of attacking options, plenty of attacking choices A lot of box six to Garis Elthgate, just one questionable one about the defence, about being a focus for the whole game But it has been so hard to focus on because it has been such a strange game in that regard The list of goals scored us, the excellent Bellingham with the first two goals from Saka, Sterling scored his 20th goal for England Marcus Rashford scored on his England comeback, Jack Greely scored his first goal at the World Cup So we have a final score of England six, Iran two, a record score England have never scored six in their first match at a World Cup before, it is their biggest win in their first match at a World Cup Six-two here in the Khalifa Stadium
