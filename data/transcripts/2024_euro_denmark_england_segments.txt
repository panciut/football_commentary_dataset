[0.00 - 7.80] P:1615.39 E:0.071940 |  And Joachim Anderson of Crystal Palace as well as Pierre-Emile Hoivier of Chotland.
[7.80 - 9.92] P:1725.56 E:0.111605 |  And the England team, as I say, unchanged.
[9.92 - 12.32] P:1671.32 E:0.101726 |  Pickford, Walker-Stone, Gaye and Trivia.
[12.32 - 16.76] P:1543.55 E:0.097280 |  Alexander-Arnolden-Rice, Saka, Bellingham, Thoddon and Kane.
[16.76 - 21.00] P:1680.69 E:0.109971 |  But before we get underway for this group-seat match,
[21.00 - 26.52] P:1705.37 E:0.111714 |  there is going to be a mark of respect shown to Gerhard Eichner,
[26.52 - 30.20] P:1795.89 E:0.103664 |  one serving UEFA General Secretary.
[30.20 - 33.08] P:1804.04 E:0.111813 |  It was German who has passed away.
[44.08 - 47.08] P:1652.03 E:0.117250 |  And on those screens above the centre-circle,
[47.08 - 53.96] P:1768.29 E:0.115628 |  black and white photograph of the face of Gerhard Eichner, 1943 to 2024.
[56.52 - 58.52] P:1995.56 E:0.099351 |  APPLAUSE
[66.12 - 68.20] P:1726.32 E:0.120501 |  And the players break away now.
[68.20 - 70.72] P:1820.11 E:0.114013 |  The Danish players going to a huddle.
[70.72 - 72.72] P:1838.71 E:0.108966 |  England are ready to start.
[73.72 - 75.88] P:1841.25 E:0.118174 |  Matt Upsen, Conakordi up here with me.
[75.88 - 79.00] P:1836.46 E:0.104825 |  Izzy Christensen is down behind the goal.
[79.00 - 81.24] P:1866.15 E:0.103831 |  Actually, Jordan Pickford's goal in the first half weeks,
[81.24 - 85.04] P:1788.31 E:0.104096 |  walking directly towards Izzy, who's just over the hoardings.
[85.08 - 87.68] P:1688.94 E:0.099496 |  Next to the goal, the Danish fans behind them.
[87.68 - 90.88] P:1737.40 E:0.110518 |  A wonderful, colourful scene inside the ground.
[90.88 - 94.68] P:1720.80 E:0.117986 |  And here we go, England knowing that if they can win here tonight,
[94.68 - 96.32] P:1715.35 E:0.104094 |  making two wins out of two,
[96.32 - 100.52] P:1802.86 E:0.114486 |  England will be going through as group winners with a match to spare.
[100.52 - 106.48] P:1844.30 E:0.104515 |  But it is Denmark, ranked 21 in the world, who are up against them tonight.
[106.48 - 110.28] P:1736.81 E:0.099543 |  Bukajosaka kicks off a game, plays it all the way back to Pickford,
[110.28 - 112.32] P:1626.40 E:0.110573 |  who hits the long pass through the middle,
[112.32 - 116.20] P:1736.11 E:0.106726 |  and then Denmark firing away downfield, and here's Rasmus Hoiland.
[116.20 - 119.28] P:1748.22 E:0.098807 |  As the pitch cuts up quite significantly actually there,
[119.28 - 120.76] P:1726.11 E:0.106751 |  there's Walker Chaserson.
[120.76 - 122.36] P:1637.78 E:0.114285 |  Denmark played into the edge of the area,
[122.36 - 124.16] P:1852.38 E:0.111062 |  a low shot from the edge of the box,
[124.16 - 126.76] P:1864.53 E:0.109083 |  from Hoibier of Tottenham, but that straight of Pickford
[126.76 - 128.32] P:1859.58 E:0.112501 |  is able to deal with it easily.
[128.32 - 132.60] P:1844.36 E:0.117409 |  I mean, that's a massive chunk of turf that has just scooped out of the pitch.
[132.60 - 136.32] P:1838.53 E:0.117318 |  He's really has chunked up there from Karl Walker,
[136.32 - 138.04] P:1864.77 E:0.097778 |  as he just put the brakes on.
[138.04 - 141.68] P:1748.21 E:0.115254 |  But a little indicator of what Hoiland brings to Denmark,
[141.68 - 144.24] P:1631.83 E:0.109456 |  that's a bit different. He has that running power.
[144.24 - 146.28] P:1699.43 E:0.104583 |  He'll work the channels as much as he can.
[146.28 - 150.44] P:1636.40 E:0.110971 |  Yeah. Rasmus Hoiland, who ended the season,
[150.44 - 153.72] P:1686.23 E:0.111937 |  out of the Manchester United team, he was being used as a substitute.
[153.72 - 156.04] P:1738.76 E:0.111854 |  But he was Denmark's top scorer in qualifying.
[156.04 - 159.96] P:1677.40 E:0.098823 |  England give it away, Alexander-Arnold, passing it straight to Victor Christensen.
[159.96 - 162.00] P:1695.23 E:0.111672 |  Now the ball through the middle to Hoiland, but it comes back,
[162.00 - 163.44] P:1734.63 E:0.105317 |  and now he has Harry Kane.
[163.44 - 165.48] P:1664.93 E:0.115792 |  As the ball is given to him, he just scoops it forward,
[165.48 - 168.48] P:1781.69 E:0.109226 |  and he has a first chance for Bukajosaka to show what he can do,
[168.48 - 170.36] P:1862.20 E:0.103079 |  but the cover is there.
[170.40 - 173.92] P:1694.87 E:0.109973 |  From Hoibja, who's able to just tackle it out of play.
[173.92 - 176.12] P:1699.76 E:0.102969 |  Take it off the toe of Bukajosaka.
[176.12 - 178.68] P:1573.77 E:0.104647 |  Interesting there. When England got the chance, Kane got the chance.
[178.68 - 180.00] P:1604.85 E:0.105347 |  Immediately look into Saka.
[180.00 - 183.16] P:1607.66 E:0.106944 |  He's looking to Saka, but Conor just gave me a nudge
[183.16 - 184.40] P:1757.10 E:0.109621 |  to have a look at the centre-backs,
[184.40 - 187.32] P:1717.38 E:0.107222 |  and Christensen has gone across to the left-hand side,
[187.32 - 190.40] P:1731.24 E:0.105372 |  so he's actually started with Vestergaard in the middle,
[190.40 - 192.56] P:1784.97 E:0.109148 |  which I think is purely because of that, John.
[192.56 - 194.76] P:1772.58 E:0.117800 |  Christensen, you say, is probably a little bit more mobile,
[194.76 - 196.24] P:1503.06 E:0.095033 |  a bit lighter on his feet,
[196.24 - 199.20] P:1708.84 E:0.116443 |  more able to deal with those one-on-one situations
[199.20 - 203.08] P:1701.05 E:0.113626 |  that England are looking to put Bukajosaka into all the time.
[203.08 - 206.48] P:1836.47 E:0.112310 |  It's White Shirts, Blue Shorts and White Sox for England tonight.
[206.48 - 209.04] P:1838.33 E:0.101760 |  Saka to Walker, but Walker slips as he crosses,
[209.04 - 214.64] P:1896.69 E:0.106988 |  and there's another huge section of turf that has come up as Walker slipped,
[214.64 - 216.76] P:1835.32 E:0.099197 |  and the pitch surface does...
[216.76 - 219.20] P:1706.54 E:0.109634 |  Well, I mean, the evidence suggests it's very, very soft.
[219.20 - 221.44] P:1738.64 E:0.090120 |  It's just Walker, though, isn't it?
[221.44 - 223.28] P:1775.67 E:0.122016 |  Too much horse power has been into the ground, I think.
[223.28 - 224.84] P:1860.31 E:0.104241 |  It's just shirt and the grass up.
[224.84 - 226.52] P:1613.69 E:0.106339 |  Yeah, but that is off.
[226.52 - 228.76] P:1862.28 E:0.111153 |  You know, we were told to look out for the pitch the other night
[228.80 - 230.76] P:1741.65 E:0.105860 |  when we were in... Where were we?
[230.76 - 232.20] P:1919.04 E:0.113895 |  Düsseldorf. Yeah.
[232.20 - 236.04] P:1900.04 E:0.114467 |  And it's held up OK, but already tonight, this is a little bit of a concern,
[236.04 - 239.24] P:1877.10 E:0.113604 |  as Alexander Arnold has to scoop the ball back to Pickford.
[239.24 - 242.88] P:1822.49 E:0.111662 |  Halfway inside his own half, and Pickford goes for a long, long left-footed pass,
[242.88 - 244.44] P:1696.62 E:0.112642 |  out towards the left-hand side.
[244.44 - 246.92] P:1641.16 E:0.108813 |  Good deal of scrutiny on Phil Thornton tonight,
[246.92 - 251.76] P:1677.14 E:0.105170 |  and he's right over there on the left-hand side in these early stages.
[251.76 - 255.60] P:1701.05 E:0.109933 |  It was noticeable against Serbia how he was very central right from the off.
[255.60 - 258.20] P:1626.26 E:0.107120 |  Yeah, I think having that with talking about
[258.20 - 261.88] P:1660.23 E:0.112724 |  maybe not being good enough with the ball or happy with keeping the ball well enough,
[261.88 - 263.28] P:1808.79 E:0.106895 |  you've got to make the pitch big, haven't you?
[263.28 - 267.28] P:1723.19 E:0.108014 |  Use the full width, and I think those wide players, Foden and Saka,
[267.28 - 268.48] P:1750.97 E:0.120390 |  really crucial to that.
[268.48 - 271.20] P:1725.20 E:0.117066 |  And they really are stationed as wide as can be,
[271.20 - 273.28] P:1660.31 E:0.100937 |  Foden on the left and Saka on the right.
[273.28 - 275.20] P:1751.68 E:0.104786 |  Just great space, John, doesn't it?
[275.20 - 277.96] P:1565.55 E:0.101970 |  Kane can drop in, midfield players can have the ball.
[277.96 - 281.96] P:1579.15 E:0.111656 |  I think controlling the game is something that England will want to do well today.
[281.96 - 287.20] P:1620.63 E:0.113079 |  This is Five Live and BBC Sounds, live from the city of Frankfurt,
[287.20 - 289.64] P:1524.92 E:0.113203 |  the medieval and modern city of Frankfurt,
[289.64 - 293.00] P:1639.61 E:0.113175 |  with Gay on the ball for England in the centre-circle.
[293.00 - 298.20] P:1677.88 E:0.115362 |  Mark Gay winning his 13th cap tonight, the Declan Rice, who's winning his 53rd.
[298.20 - 300.52] P:1675.09 E:0.114558 |  And here's Tribya, who we should mention as well,
[300.52 - 302.48] P:1816.52 E:0.115048 |  who is winning his 50th cap tonight,
[302.48 - 304.64] P:1799.36 E:0.115125 |  but acrossfield pass, looking for the other pullback,
[304.64 - 307.24] P:1832.71 E:0.108469 |  Karl Walker was over-hit by Kieran Tribya,
[307.24 - 310.28] P:1590.80 E:0.102594 |  and it drifts out of play for a throw on the halfway line to Denmark.
[310.28 - 312.64] P:1673.74 E:0.107723 |  I think some turf chunked up in the middle of the pitch as well.
[312.64 - 314.80] P:1706.26 E:0.109101 |  I mean, this is actually going to be really interesting,
[314.80 - 317.36] P:1568.37 E:0.104075 |  because it's just lying on top of the surface.
[317.36 - 321.12] P:1626.39 E:0.111406 |  So if a ball is rolling along and it hits, it's really going to bump up in the air.
[321.12 - 325.08] P:1584.35 E:0.113485 |  Well, I mean, we have had very heavy rain here,
[325.08 - 328.32] P:1727.56 E:0.105840 |  as has been the case all over Germany over the past couple of days or so.
[328.32 - 331.84] P:1610.49 E:0.111285 |  The roof is closed tonight, this sort of canopy-style roof.
[331.84 - 335.24] P:1638.11 E:0.114169 |  And I wonder whether the pitch was actually a factor in the closing of the roof.
[335.24 - 339.04] P:1708.29 E:0.105418 |  Yeah, it must have been, because I think when Gary Flint's off here a couple of days ago,
[339.04 - 341.24] P:1798.28 E:0.106636 |  they actually closed it during the downpour, didn't they?
[341.24 - 344.20] P:1639.76 E:0.116162 |  So I think that probably would have been the reason, John.
[344.40 - 347.56] P:1574.04 E:0.111560 |  Here's Morton Kuhlman in centre midfield.
[347.56 - 353.36] P:1641.40 E:0.103243 |  One of the youngsters in this Denmark line-up of Kaspar Kuhlman, the coach.
[353.36 - 357.04] P:1527.48 E:0.118346 |  It was the coach at the semi-final three years ago,
[357.04 - 358.88] P:1584.01 E:0.105815 |  and in Kato, when they were disappointing,
[358.88 - 361.48] P:1644.50 E:0.096072 |  went out at the group stage, finished bottom of the section.
[361.48 - 365.64] P:1835.44 E:0.109825 |  Denmark, red shirts, white shorts, red socks, so their first choice colours as well.
[365.64 - 369.64] P:1750.72 E:0.098891 |  Now Victor Christensen on the left-hand side, Victor Christensen back-centrally.
[369.64 - 373.24] P:1767.75 E:0.106976 |  Over here it comes to Christian Ericsson, who scored the opening goal
[373.28 - 376.88] P:1741.97 E:0.110857 |  in their first match, low-balling towards the edge of the area from Kuhlman.
[376.88 - 380.04] P:1781.74 E:0.100093 |  But England deal with that, and it's just stabbed back to Stones
[380.04 - 382.88] P:1694.65 E:0.112061 |  on the edge of the penalty area now to Walker on the right-hand side,
[382.88 - 386.40] P:1905.86 E:0.109352 |  and Walker, where the inside of his right boot,
[386.40 - 389.40] P:1908.00 E:0.111122 |  a careful pass to Bukajosaka in England,
[389.40 - 391.44] P:1949.22 E:0.120264 |  start again from inside their own half.
[391.44 - 396.16] P:1941.50 E:0.117672 |  As Stones, there's the whistling from the 16,000 Danish fans
[396.16 - 398.88] P:1946.03 E:0.114377 |  who are here in Frankfurt for this.
[398.92 - 402.68] P:1932.67 E:0.110452 |  Now Declan Rice, just inside his own half,
[402.68 - 407.88] P:1765.48 E:0.107266 |  passes it over the half-way line at close quarters to Trent Alexander-Arnold.
[407.88 - 411.12] P:1609.62 E:0.112687 |  If you've just switched onto it, if you're on your way home, just leaving work,
[411.12 - 413.84] P:1672.29 E:0.113328 |  it is nil-nil, and England are unchanged for the same team.
[413.84 - 416.00] P:1699.76 E:0.098868 |  That's given away by Walker.
[416.00 - 420.08] P:1729.30 E:0.105351 |  Now Christian Ericsson, former teammate of Kyle Walker, is at Tottenham,
[420.08 - 422.84] P:1785.85 E:0.113592 |  and then Walker into the challenge that bounces out of play
[422.84 - 427.16] P:1886.51 E:0.113939 |  for what is given as a throw-in to England, which is disputed by the Danes.
[427.16 - 430.92] P:1793.31 E:0.113103 |  Mark Gehr, he started positively again, made a really good decision moments ago,
[430.92 - 434.04] P:1708.39 E:0.109508 |  just to step in and deal with the situation.
[434.04 - 438.16] P:1675.69 E:0.113691 |  He really is being proactive with his positioning, reading of the play.
[438.16 - 440.16] P:1731.88 E:0.116787 |  He's been very good at the start of this game as well.
[440.16 - 442.08] P:1704.44 E:0.118522 |  Five minutes played, let's bring in Conor Coddie,
[442.08 - 444.92] P:1756.04 E:0.111421 |  who is in Garren Southgate's last two squads at the tournament.
[444.92 - 446.64] P:1684.82 E:0.105632 |  What have you made of the start, Conor?
[446.64 - 448.88] P:1727.31 E:0.126262 |  I think England are in control of the ball, they're doing it well,
[448.88 - 451.48] P:1790.80 E:0.107595 |  but I think Denmark are showing what a back-five does for you.
[451.48 - 454.52] P:1744.48 E:0.114373 |  It solidifies, it gives you a little bit of control without the ball,
[454.52 - 456.64] P:1785.24 E:0.117227 |  and I think you can see they're not chasing the ball too much,
[456.64 - 459.72] P:1680.40 E:0.113345 |  they're sitting in that little mid-block on the way of England to make a mistake.
[459.72 - 462.40] P:1665.11 E:0.115107 |  Like we've seen with the crossfielder pass before from Kieran Tripp,
[462.40 - 465.48] P:1689.74 E:0.110602 |  so very steady start, but England in control.
[465.48 - 468.04] P:1843.66 E:0.110527 |  Yeah, it's a real flat-back-five, isn't it, for Denmark?
[468.04 - 472.72] P:1777.23 E:0.110469 |  And the more Walker slips again, again, more turf comes up on the right wing,
[472.72 - 474.80] P:1758.07 E:0.103174 |  as he slams the brakes on.
[474.80 - 478.48] P:1784.93 E:0.104943 |  And you know, this pitch surface now is actually quite choppy.
[478.48 - 480.72] P:1747.35 E:0.111838 |  Alexander-Arnold's ball over the top, there's too much on that,
[480.72 - 482.44] P:1873.47 E:0.102219 |  and the ball skips through to Casper Schmeichel.
[482.44 - 484.52] P:1734.27 E:0.111094 |  Yeah, it's the run that Saka loves, though, isn't it?
[484.56 - 485.84] P:1806.33 E:0.087506 |  That out to him.
[485.84 - 489.84] P:1725.93 E:0.094970 |  If Alexander-Arnold could pick the right pass with the right weight,
[489.84 - 493.20] P:1733.74 E:0.102416 |  he just gets that little run, and it's very much Victor Christensen,
[493.20 - 495.64] P:1689.94 E:0.108984 |  who's dropping all the way back in that left-back position
[495.64 - 500.12] P:1568.48 E:0.103913 |  and leaving the other Christensen, the centre-back, a little bit narrower,
[500.12 - 503.04] P:1584.65 E:0.103883 |  so the space for Saka isn't quite there maybe to get it wide,
[503.04 - 504.64] P:1487.03 E:0.104028 |  and he's got to beat two players at that point,
[504.64 - 507.12] P:1591.18 E:0.111800 |  so that little run inside could be on.
[508.80 - 511.00] P:1766.95 E:0.122449 |  This match is all over the BBC tonight.
[511.00 - 514.48] P:1601.58 E:0.112167 |  BBC One, if you get home, Game Over, and Alan Shearer are not far away.
[514.52 - 519.12] P:1534.47 E:0.115174 |  They're far away from us here, and with it being a BBC live match,
[519.12 - 522.92] P:1578.47 E:0.111448 |  you can actually sync up the radio commentary, if you wish,
[522.92 - 525.80] P:1568.75 E:0.111124 |  with the TV pictures and continue listening to us.
[525.80 - 531.36] P:1606.15 E:0.103365 |  Just look for five live euros extra on the iPlayer or the website or the app,
[531.36 - 533.28] P:1550.67 E:0.099128 |  on the Smart Speaker as well,
[533.28 - 536.04] P:1626.41 E:0.099602 |  and indeed there's also a Jamie Johnson option
[536.04 - 538.76] P:1564.11 E:0.101341 |  with our old friend Conor McNamara doing that.
[538.76 - 541.72] P:1555.38 E:0.107104 |  Denmark in possession, ten yards inside the England half.
[541.72 - 544.96] P:1766.50 E:0.110802 |  Huybier now, looks for a ball out towards the right-hand side.
[544.96 - 547.08] P:1663.02 E:0.107049 |  Mela catches up with that near the dead-ball line.
[547.08 - 548.64] P:1840.14 E:0.115321 |  Trippie comes in with a challenge,
[548.64 - 551.32] P:1930.16 E:0.121819 |  and as he just flicked it away from him, Trippie out his court.
[551.32 - 553.20] P:1933.09 E:0.113139 |  The Danish supporters don't like that.
[553.20 - 555.80] P:1956.61 E:0.115681 |  He's given by the assistant on the far side, pre-kicked to England.
[555.80 - 558.44] P:1951.27 E:0.108296 |  Yeah, good ball across, but Trippie does well.
[558.44 - 559.56] P:1925.33 E:0.110806 |  Tries to keep it in there,
[559.56 - 562.32] P:1788.46 E:0.106692 |  but he just nicks the ball in front of him and wins the foul
[562.32 - 564.12] P:1669.15 E:0.104258 |  and takes the sting out of the situation.
[564.12 - 568.36] P:1734.49 E:0.112831 |  I think somebody's just gone scampering out of the England bench-junk.
[568.36 - 571.40] P:1832.49 E:0.122665 |  It's going to get a new pair of boots, possibly, for Carl Walker.
[571.48 - 574.48] P:1762.33 E:0.116365 |  I don't think he's too happy with the footway, with all the slipping going on.
[574.48 - 577.36] P:1679.35 E:0.115229 |  And Kieran Trippie are very much winning that free kick.
[577.36 - 582.36] P:1694.39 E:0.113287 |  We were talking to Alan Sheerat this morning about Kieran Trippie
[582.36 - 584.64] P:1783.93 E:0.114924 |  and whether he might have had an issue at the end of the match,
[584.64 - 588.32] P:1911.64 E:0.121091 |  and he suggested that perhaps that was out of the usual Newcastle playbook.
[588.32 - 590.56] P:1992.34 E:0.113471 |  What happened at the end of the Serbia match?
[590.56 - 592.80] P:1938.71 E:0.109271 |  Now, Carl Walker, who Matt mentioned,
[592.80 - 596.60] P:1915.04 E:0.111896 |  who has been struggling with his boots and slipping on the pitch,
[596.60 - 599.72] P:1837.51 E:0.100905 |  he has actually sat down on the field.
[599.76 - 604.92] P:1853.48 E:0.101360 |  And whether he's tweaked something or whether he's actually just...
[607.28 - 609.32] P:1826.53 E:0.118225 |  ...taking a bit of time, and it does actually look as though
[609.32 - 613.24] P:1735.95 E:0.099578 |  he might have turned his ankle as the pitch gave way beneath him,
[613.24 - 614.64] P:1796.33 E:0.109051 |  according to the pictures we're seeing.
[614.64 - 615.64] P:1836.38 E:0.084311 |  Oh, yeah.
[615.64 - 619.00] P:1764.67 E:0.108740 |  Yeah, he certainly put a lot of weight on that outside of the foot.
[619.00 - 623.24] P:1757.72 E:0.102527 |  He slipped fully as the turf just chunked up in the air,
[623.24 - 626.12] P:1635.29 E:0.113035 |  and he really did put a lot of weight on his ankle when it was rolled over.
[626.12 - 628.12] P:1822.01 E:0.105103 |  Let's go down pitch site. Is he Christensen?
[628.68 - 632.32] P:1767.09 E:0.116623 |  Yeah, I've just seen Carl Walker signalling to Jordan Pickford
[632.32 - 636.36] P:1841.57 E:0.115144 |  when England won that free quick with Trippie that he needed to go down.
[636.36 - 639.44] P:1762.84 E:0.111999 |  He dropped and sat down, and it's given themselves the opportunity
[639.44 - 641.52] P:1742.20 E:0.119269 |  to get him off and get him into different boots.
[641.52 - 644.40] P:1733.21 E:0.113594 |  Cos, like you say, Matt and John in commentary,
[644.40 - 647.64] P:1718.93 E:0.107575 |  the pitch is starting to be a real factor, which wasn't during the warm-up,
[647.64 - 649.32] P:1817.09 E:0.110420 |  but it's good that Carl Walker can address that
[649.32 - 652.04] P:1728.17 E:0.115413 |  and hopefully can be back on the pitch any minute now.
[652.04 - 655.16] P:1764.90 E:0.109323 |  Yeah, so he's off the field at the moment, and he is changing his boots.
[655.20 - 658.12] P:1669.09 E:0.102322 |  So it would appear that he is coming out of the field,
[658.12 - 661.12] P:1761.76 E:0.100910 |  but he's out of position, so Trent Alexander-Arnold, of course,
[661.12 - 663.92] P:1713.61 E:0.107474 |  is the ideal man out on the field in midfield
[663.92 - 666.24] P:1738.00 E:0.091166 |  to slip back into the right-back position.
[666.24 - 669.08] P:1723.74 E:0.101494 |  Walker still is working away. He's got one boot on.
[669.08 - 671.36] P:1748.45 E:0.096353 |  He's got the other boot on now. He's tying his laces.
[671.36 - 674.36] P:1687.38 E:0.102310 |  Denmark Nill. England Nill is the score.
[675.12 - 677.96] P:1642.02 E:0.098610 |  And Denmark in possession.
[677.96 - 680.68] P:1642.16 E:0.102270 |  Hoipir with a pass over the halfway line,
[680.68 - 683.08] P:1799.34 E:0.102436 |  then it comes in field through the middle bit,
[683.08 - 685.44] P:1801.73 E:0.114224 |  given away by the pass of Hulman and England now,
[685.44 - 688.40] P:1816.79 E:0.104482 |  are on the move forward with Jude Bellingham.
[688.40 - 691.48] P:1684.19 E:0.111177 |  Not really seen in the action yet in the match.
[691.48 - 694.28] P:1803.90 E:0.107003 |  The man who scored the opening goal of the tournament,
[694.28 - 695.88] P:1865.54 E:0.098694 |  the winner against Serbia.
[695.88 - 697.20] P:1750.55 E:0.115395 |  Great deal of talk about him.
[697.20 - 698.84] P:1823.61 E:0.109002 |  He was the focus of attention yesterday
[698.84 - 702.00] P:1754.99 E:0.099375 |  when everyone was doing their talking, and here he is again.
[702.00 - 705.16] P:1857.73 E:0.102180 |  Jude Bellingham, 20 years old,
[705.16 - 709.60] P:1684.35 E:0.100073 |  21 in, well, nine days' time on the 29th of June.
[710.44 - 711.88] P:1685.96 E:0.106838 |  Fordham now on the left-hand side.
[711.88 - 715.64] P:1738.65 E:0.104246 |  Fordham with a ball in field towards Alexander-Arton.
[715.64 - 718.24] P:1707.97 E:0.105353 |  Kyle Walker has now been allowed back onto the field,
[718.24 - 720.08] P:1684.93 E:0.101947 |  and it looks as though he's OK.
[720.08 - 722.60] P:1715.31 E:0.107343 |  A little bit of concern after he went over on his ankle.
[722.60 - 726.00] P:1692.84 E:0.110469 |  Like he comes to Mark Gay, and across to John Stones.
[726.00 - 727.84] P:1455.42 E:0.112575 |  There he evens start to the match.
[727.84 - 732.36] P:1623.87 E:0.111156 |  It's been that one comfortable save from Jordan Pigford.
[732.36 - 734.64] P:1706.61 E:0.113445 |  Here is now Saka on the right-hand side,
[734.64 - 736.20] P:1600.57 E:0.110807 |  up against Victor Christensen.
[736.20 - 739.00] P:1781.46 E:0.120394 |  A ball in fit, and then Bellingham is eased over.
[739.00 - 741.84] P:1800.88 E:0.109766 |  That looked like a shove in the back from Hoipir.
[742.32 - 745.04] P:1650.72 E:0.104989 |  And he's just tapped the ball out of play.
[745.04 - 747.60] P:1682.89 E:0.104912 |  He's very sportsman-like. That was very sportsman.
[747.60 - 748.44] P:1640.83 E:0.102351 |  Wasn't it?
[748.44 - 750.56] P:1777.05 E:0.112223 |  I think Jude Bellingham was on the floor,
[750.56 - 751.92] P:1512.52 E:0.108440 |  but it wasn't a problem with him.
[751.92 - 754.12] P:1722.48 E:0.100320 |  He could have easily just driven on with the ball there.
[754.12 - 756.64] P:1784.37 E:0.105474 |  How odd! Hoipir, and he just rolls it out.
[756.64 - 757.84] P:1751.90 E:0.094183 |  It was a fair challenge for him.
[757.84 - 759.44] P:1753.45 E:0.094174 |  Now, if he wins the ball,
[759.44 - 763.36] P:1687.50 E:0.107153 |  Bellingham goes to ground, and in my book, that's just play on.
[764.76 - 766.84] P:1592.38 E:0.109386 |  Anyway, plays back into England,
[766.84 - 769.36] P:1420.80 E:0.097499 |  giving it back to Denmark, still 0-0.
[769.36 - 772.24] P:1426.43 E:0.112056 |  And it is Denmark, who are playing from right to left,
[772.24 - 775.36] P:1599.33 E:0.111067 |  so they're attacking the end where the Danish courts are.
[775.36 - 777.64] P:1555.53 E:0.107508 |  What a noise is coming out of there
[777.64 - 780.48] P:1504.46 E:0.112796 |  as they begin to bob up and down together.
[781.12 - 784.72] P:1606.00 E:0.115131 |  And here's Andreas Christensen with a long pass
[784.72 - 786.64] P:1804.12 E:0.120301 |  through the middle towards Hoiland,
[786.64 - 789.04] P:1717.59 E:0.117174 |  who very nearly got away from Mark Gay,
[789.04 - 792.72] P:1820.95 E:0.109914 |  who did extremely well to recover, but actually the offside flag goes up.
[792.72 - 794.08] P:1779.54 E:0.108379 |  That's that run, isn't it?
[794.08 - 797.12] P:1772.23 E:0.105949 |  Talked about Hoiland before, what he brings different to this team,
[797.12 - 799.16] P:1719.91 E:0.090983 |  and he will stretch people.
[799.20 - 802.20] P:1772.70 E:0.104997 |  Just a little bit of an uneven line there,
[802.20 - 804.48] P:1677.49 E:0.104767 |  and Hoiland gets between stones again.
[804.48 - 806.20] P:1686.46 E:0.105105 |  Yes, he's a fraction offside,
[806.20 - 808.52] P:1655.61 E:0.111707 |  but I don't think Gay really quite knew his position.
[808.52 - 810.96] P:1624.09 E:0.102492 |  He was a little bit more advanced than John Stones.
[810.96 - 813.76] P:1637.13 E:0.106857 |  Here is Kyle Walker, who's got the right boots on now.
[813.76 - 815.76] P:1534.04 E:0.095631 |  Doesn't slip over this time.
[815.76 - 819.08] P:1663.85 E:0.108323 |  Checked back, gives it to Alexander-Arnold, who goes one of those passes.
[819.08 - 820.92] P:1664.24 E:0.113690 |  High out towards the left-hand side, by Trippier,
[820.92 - 822.44] P:1584.40 E:0.111952 |  takes it down with his right foot,
[822.44 - 824.72] P:1617.06 E:0.110545 |  plays an aerial ball into the penalty area to Bellingham,
[824.72 - 826.84] P:1651.41 E:0.107371 |  who pulls it down with the top of his shoulder,
[826.88 - 829.28] P:1648.29 E:0.104506 |  and then takes it back out into the full-back area,
[829.28 - 833.08] P:1627.72 E:0.098856 |  back to Trippier on his right foot, Bellingham receives it.
[833.08 - 834.92] P:1651.19 E:0.098219 |  Now he is folding on the edge of the box.
[834.92 - 837.84] P:1844.38 E:0.111580 |  It's the first time we've seen England really getting into their stride
[837.84 - 840.40] P:1937.82 E:0.101604 |  in the defence of third of the games.
[840.40 - 843.48] P:1961.56 E:0.107381 |  Walker, then to Saka, right corner of the penalty area,
[843.48 - 846.92] P:1958.41 E:0.097755 |  just outside the box, comes back to Alexander-Arnold.
[846.92 - 849.68] P:1934.77 E:0.095306 |  Saka again, but this is all rather static,
[849.68 - 853.88] P:1893.82 E:0.100366 |  and indeed the ball-mormos comes to a stop at the feet of Bukhaya Saka.
[855.04 - 856.64] P:1884.14 E:0.105124 |  Rice, back out to Walker.
[856.68 - 858.96] P:1817.53 E:0.109506 |  Walker's low ball into the edge of the aerial, Foden.
[858.96 - 862.24] P:1915.88 E:0.111533 |  Foden beats his man, he's into the area, a right-foot shot,
[862.24 - 866.40] P:1952.58 E:0.109439 |  wide of the top-left corner, so often this season.
[866.40 - 869.08] P:1929.50 E:0.108140 |  We've seen Foden do exactly that,
[869.08 - 873.92] P:1814.84 E:0.108382 |  and get into the penalty area and bury it, but that was promising.
[873.92 - 876.80] P:1717.37 E:0.105721 |  That's exactly what we want to see from Phil Foden.
[876.80 - 878.16] P:1673.90 E:0.116506 |  The position where he picks the ball up
[878.16 - 880.64] P:1766.19 E:0.108348 |  becomes all the way across, past the middle of the pitch,
[880.64 - 882.60] P:1740.58 E:0.100131 |  picks it up more on the right-hand side.
[882.60 - 884.36] P:1791.41 E:0.114520 |  The first little bit of footwork was lovely,
[884.36 - 885.56] P:1765.99 E:0.103845 |  just shot around the player,
[885.56 - 889.20] P:1754.93 E:0.108997 |  because I think he could have took it straight onto his left foot for a shot,
[889.20 - 891.20] P:1707.51 E:0.109383 |  but then he comes back onto his right,
[891.20 - 893.80] P:1700.53 E:0.115031 |  and it's hard to open his body up again onto his left foot,
[893.80 - 895.28] P:1836.30 E:0.109923 |  to curl it into the far post.
[895.28 - 897.36] P:1772.90 E:0.112187 |  He's always leaning to one side,
[897.36 - 899.36] P:1816.32 E:0.118607 |  and the ball just rises over the crossbar,
[899.36 - 901.48] P:1717.98 E:0.110052 |  but better from England than pass.
[901.48 - 905.36] P:1658.13 E:0.112914 |  And I think Trent Alexander-Arnold had one chance to maybe just put that cross in early,
[905.36 - 907.44] P:1582.16 E:0.105368 |  got set back to go on his right foot,
[907.44 - 911.40] P:1543.44 E:0.112351 |  in a lovely position with his quality, just sticking in the box.
[911.40 - 913.96] P:1659.45 E:0.110182 |  You've got Jude Bellingham arriving, waving his hand in the air,
[913.96 - 915.56] P:1427.36 E:0.106723 |  Harry Kane's in there,
[915.56 - 918.92] P:1604.80 E:0.105157 |  put the Danish defence under pressure and make him defend a good cross.
[918.92 - 923.52] P:1561.17 E:0.106617 |  Still no-nail, but that's the first proper opportunity for England.
[923.52 - 926.00] P:1592.96 E:0.114524 |  Phil Foden just inside the box, opening his body,
[926.00 - 927.88] P:1703.31 E:0.106817 |  but shooting wide at the top left corner.
[927.88 - 929.64] P:1620.86 E:0.102863 |  Alexander-Arnold, that was awkward.
[929.64 - 932.28] P:1658.54 E:0.108710 |  That was given to him by Sacher at waist height,
[932.28 - 934.04] P:1632.97 E:0.115729 |  but a lovely touch, actually, with the ball.
[934.04 - 939.08] P:1870.24 E:0.115733 |  And then Sacher chases after it, and he's eased over by Victor Christensen.
[939.12 - 944.28] P:1793.93 E:0.108008 |  But referee Suarez Diaz says no free kick.
[944.28 - 948.52] P:1740.69 E:0.098188 |  Take the throw, Denmark, which they do, back to the edge of the penalty area.
[948.52 - 953.68] P:1679.21 E:0.094985 |  But as well, with Foden, I'm thinking that that's how it's supposed to work.
[953.68 - 956.64] P:1618.79 E:0.100796 |  Foden at one moment is wide out on the left-hand side,
[956.64 - 959.40] P:1519.86 E:0.101243 |  but then making the right decision went to come in.
[959.40 - 962.16] P:1617.33 E:0.106605 |  Yeah, but when England are building up with the ball from the back, you want him wide.
[962.16 - 965.36] P:1629.42 E:0.111575 |  So he'll be on the touchline, but if the play is in general,
[965.36 - 966.76] P:1703.05 E:0.103845 |  he's drifted over to the right-hand side,
[966.76 - 968.64] P:1492.64 E:0.107295 |  then he's got that freedom to come into the pitch
[968.64 - 971.04] P:1443.77 E:0.110030 |  and pick the ball up exactly where he did,
[971.04 - 973.84] P:1601.56 E:0.106070 |  which is where he does a lot of his damage.
[974.84 - 979.28] P:1500.69 E:0.116990 |  Mala over on the far side, who was involved in the semi-final three years ago.
[979.28 - 982.12] P:1591.66 E:0.113279 |  Five of that team are starting for Denmark today.
[982.12 - 985.08] P:1460.31 E:0.114358 |  Six of the England team, lots of familiarity.
[985.08 - 987.40] P:1554.70 E:0.114410 |  It's Andreas Christensen, the former Chelsea man,
[987.40 - 989.32] P:1649.18 E:0.114475 |  who's had a good season at Barcelona, plays it forward.
[989.32 - 992.60] P:1827.05 E:0.108680 |  But that's won back by Walker, and then Sacher's pass, took a deflection.
[992.60 - 994.72] P:1671.95 E:0.107458 |  So it's going to be a throw-in on the half-way line.
[994.72 - 995.88] P:1712.09 E:0.098839 |  I think he's OK.
[995.92 - 997.84] P:1655.23 E:0.100973 |  Walker, I think it was just the boots, wasn't it?
[997.84 - 1002.48] P:1562.75 E:0.096882 |  I think he went down with the injury, shall we say,
[1002.48 - 1004.68] P:1649.83 E:0.103611 |  to be able to change the boots, and he then had to come off
[1004.68 - 1006.60] P:1692.94 E:0.097399 |  because it was going to take so long to change the boots,
[1006.60 - 1010.16] P:1610.14 E:0.100372 |  but thankfully there was nothing wrong in terms of him physically.
[1011.28 - 1012.72] P:1767.31 E:0.117593 |  Yes, Kyle Walker.
[1012.72 - 1018.08] P:1871.99 E:0.107329 |  If you heard the football daily this morning, Conor Caudi had a chat with him yesterday.
[1018.08 - 1019.48] P:1779.91 E:0.112908 |  I'm sure it's still on there.
[1019.48 - 1020.88] P:1856.06 E:0.120492 |  It was all very, very friendly.
[1020.88 - 1023.28] P:1887.94 E:0.116763 |  They were on the same... Conor got a tremendous welcome
[1023.28 - 1025.32] P:1904.41 E:0.115435 |  from Garret Southgate and Kyle Walker,
[1025.32 - 1030.48] P:1847.19 E:0.104934 |  and it was very much we are-wulf-driven, the interview.
[1030.48 - 1033.64] P:1778.74 E:0.099813 |  Here is Alexander-Arnold in the centre-circle.
[1033.64 - 1035.12] P:1567.65 E:0.115308 |  Alexander-Arnold right for the ball.
[1035.12 - 1036.52] P:1842.72 E:0.114983 |  He was looking for the pass-out to Caudi,
[1036.52 - 1039.48] P:1783.26 E:0.103226 |  but that was right onto the chest of Maylatt.
[1039.48 - 1042.16] P:1650.23 E:0.104111 |  So Denmark have the ball again inside their own half.
[1042.16 - 1044.32] P:1796.08 E:0.089976 |  15 minutes played then.
[1044.32 - 1047.00] P:1671.66 E:0.097226 |  Still Denmark nil, England nil.
[1047.00 - 1049.72] P:1610.57 E:0.104237 |  And if you just got out of work into your car earlier,
[1049.72 - 1054.68] P:1624.93 E:0.092593 |  it finished Slovenia one, Serbia one in our early commentary match.
[1054.68 - 1056.68] P:1569.12 E:0.112006 |  The game was played in Munich,
[1056.68 - 1059.16] P:1628.76 E:0.105554 |  and that means that if England win this match,
[1059.16 - 1061.92] P:1837.43 E:0.116482 |  they will finish top of the group.
[1061.92 - 1063.36] P:1963.15 E:0.118660 |  Denmark have given it away.
[1063.36 - 1065.40] P:1866.68 E:0.107372 |  Schmeichel played it out, Rice is onto this.
[1065.40 - 1066.72] P:1802.93 E:0.105082 |  Rice on the edge of the area.
[1066.72 - 1068.68] P:1874.44 E:0.110323 |  Back it comes to Kane, onto his left foot.
[1068.68 - 1071.68] P:1824.25 E:0.101887 |  Kane with the shot, but that's blocked on the edge of the box
[1071.68 - 1073.88] P:1793.99 E:0.109182 |  by a falling Joachim Andersen.
[1073.88 - 1079.08] P:1778.19 E:0.104509 |  And Kane very nearly found the spot that he wanted there to take the shot.
[1079.12 - 1080.88] P:1765.19 E:0.108319 |  It all comes from the pressure of Declan Rice.
[1080.88 - 1083.48] P:1886.01 E:0.116238 |  Goes all the way in, just like you see him do at Arsenal.
[1083.48 - 1087.36] P:1893.84 E:0.106207 |  That high pressure forces the error, turns the ball over,
[1087.36 - 1090.16] P:1872.74 E:0.108518 |  ends up with Kane, but I think it was Andersen, wasn't it?
[1090.16 - 1094.12] P:1830.68 E:0.105816 |  Just came narrow and just got a block off of Kane's left foot effort.
[1094.12 - 1097.00] P:1823.46 E:0.116485 |  Yeah, he was just beginning to lick his lips there,
[1097.00 - 1099.48] P:1928.18 E:0.114271 |  and he came just outside the D.
[1099.48 - 1100.92] P:1860.48 E:0.113918 |  He was lining it up, wasn't he?
[1100.92 - 1102.52] P:1875.87 E:0.110196 |  Yeah, bit like those werewolves.
[1102.52 - 1105.16] P:1836.91 E:0.113528 |  You're ahead of the curve on this werewolf feet, right?
[1105.16 - 1106.60] P:1887.27 E:0.106703 |  Conor, I think he was playing it ahead of you.
[1106.60 - 1108.60] P:1757.60 E:0.101881 |  He's got the app and everything on his phone.
[1108.60 - 1111.48] P:1684.40 E:0.119934 |  He's already mentioned that. He's been reshaged before he got out of here.
[1111.48 - 1113.80] P:1516.26 E:0.103620 |  Yeah, he's ahead of the curve.
[1113.80 - 1115.40] P:1540.47 E:0.104547 |  It's all about the homework.
[1115.40 - 1118.20] P:1469.93 E:0.115919 |  Here is England in possession inside their own half.
[1119.16 - 1120.80] P:1610.90 E:0.120487 |  Alexander-Arnold comes under pressure,
[1120.80 - 1124.32] P:1531.24 E:0.115255 |  so plays it back to Nart G, who goes for long pass,
[1124.32 - 1126.60] P:1446.54 E:0.110479 |  just chips it here to Kyle Walker.
[1126.60 - 1130.88] P:1554.00 E:0.110513 |  And England forward towards Bukalio Saka, then infield,
[1130.88 - 1132.68] P:1693.97 E:0.114490 |  for Bellingham, who lays the pass forward.
[1132.68 - 1136.12] P:1914.28 E:0.115384 |  But in fact, Walker is on to Christensen.
[1136.12 - 1137.40] P:1916.03 E:0.110207 |  Walker's into the box.
[1137.40 - 1139.08] P:1941.26 E:0.116467 |  Walker pulls it across, double-deflicks it.
[1139.08 - 1143.64] P:2002.20 E:0.120841 |  Kane, left foot in, it goes, and England have the lead.
[1143.64 - 1146.28] P:1870.81 E:0.116321 |  Brilliant from Kyle Walker.
[1146.28 - 1148.72] P:1900.31 E:0.118775 |  Victor Christensen was asleep,
[1148.72 - 1151.08] P:1925.53 E:0.115143 |  and Kyle Walker took full advantage.
[1151.08 - 1154.84] P:1790.31 E:0.113201 |  A couple of ricochets, and then the man pounces.
[1154.84 - 1159.00] P:1831.56 E:0.114195 |  The England number nine, the captain, the record scorer.
[1159.00 - 1161.28] P:1883.57 E:0.117733 |  He scored at the World Cup in Russia.
[1161.28 - 1163.64] P:1844.03 E:0.114598 |  He scored at the Euros at Wendry.
[1163.64 - 1165.96] P:1867.36 E:0.115648 |  He scored at the World Cup in Qatar.
[1165.96 - 1168.40] P:1781.31 E:0.116860 |  And now he's off the mark here in Germany.
[1168.40 - 1172.76] P:1750.49 E:0.114276 |  The Bayern Munich man makes it Denmark, nail England one.
[1172.76 - 1175.16] P:1917.67 E:0.105551 |  Well, it's just great for him, Kyle Walker.
[1175.16 - 1177.00] P:1768.17 E:0.110792 |  He's not half asleep.
[1177.00 - 1178.80] P:1870.88 E:0.123857 |  He knows what he wants, and he goes for the ball.
[1178.80 - 1180.84] P:1860.86 E:0.102728 |  He just gambles really.
[1180.84 - 1183.36] P:1899.36 E:0.112327 |  And it's Victor Christensen, who thinks he's got the situation
[1183.36 - 1185.96] P:1857.07 E:0.100893 |  under control, the Danish left wing back.
[1185.96 - 1189.76] P:1818.07 E:0.114902 |  I mean, he sees Saka, he's got no idea that Kyle Walker
[1189.76 - 1191.64] P:1855.65 E:0.089697 |  is on the outside of him,
[1191.64 - 1194.12] P:1868.85 E:0.109981 |  charging down the pitch to try and win the ball.
[1194.16 - 1196.24] P:1872.16 E:0.106432 |  And he just steps in at the last second.
[1196.24 - 1197.96] P:1844.68 E:0.110931 |  I mean, it must be a real shock to Christensen.
[1197.96 - 1199.48] P:1825.23 E:0.096785 |  He has no clue he's there.
[1199.48 - 1201.56] P:1897.63 E:0.112573 |  Walker with his head up, the pitch caves in again.
[1201.56 - 1205.68] P:1748.11 E:0.104967 |  I mean, he very nearly lost the ball as the pitch ripped up.
[1205.68 - 1209.40] P:1718.45 E:0.107888 |  The turf came off as he crosses it into Kane.
[1209.40 - 1212.28] P:1733.48 E:0.114403 |  It ricochets into the path of Harry Kane.
[1212.28 - 1213.52] P:1699.97 E:0.108956 |  It can't be any better.
[1213.52 - 1215.64] P:1568.37 E:0.115997 |  He's a little bit fortunate, really,
[1215.64 - 1218.32] P:1720.48 E:0.110192 |  the way the ball ends up on Harry Kane's left foot.
[1218.32 - 1221.84] P:1781.99 E:0.112433 |  But he's six yards out with half the goal to Amat,
[1221.84 - 1223.12] P:1784.31 E:0.113826 |  and he just sides-footed it.
[1223.12 - 1226.56] P:1717.86 E:0.110485 |  He's not going to get many easier finishes than that,
[1226.56 - 1229.24] P:1765.88 E:0.110487 |  but it's just about the pressure from Kyle Walker
[1229.24 - 1231.36] P:1685.89 E:0.110501 |  that makes the opportunity happen.
[1231.36 - 1233.56] P:1565.70 E:0.112672 |  Denmark, Neil, England one,
[1233.56 - 1236.32] P:1551.16 E:0.113223 |  that's bringing Conor Codie for a view on that.
[1236.32 - 1239.28] P:1752.68 E:0.115878 |  It was not pretty defensively, Conor.
[1239.28 - 1240.52] P:1829.33 E:0.121248 |  No, no, not at all.
[1240.52 - 1242.52] P:1795.77 E:0.117529 |  But let's look at it from England points of view.
[1242.52 - 1244.52] P:1737.16 E:0.122265 |  I thought he was outstanding from Kyle Walker
[1244.52 - 1246.52] P:1646.41 E:0.111278 |  to keep his run going down the line there
[1246.52 - 1248.76] P:1715.50 E:0.120399 |  and just pick pocket Victor Christensen a little bit,
[1248.76 - 1250.76] P:1706.51 E:0.108506 |  and then obviously a little bit of looking.
[1250.76 - 1252.76] P:1711.34 E:0.118204 |  I didn't like Mattie said, he doesn't want an easier chance.
[1252.76 - 1254.76] P:1740.41 E:0.118147 |  Does he keep his goal in the Euros?
[1254.76 - 1257.96] P:1784.12 E:0.113592 |  Is he a good start at Brigham, then let's hope he can pick on now.
[1257.96 - 1261.36] P:1819.06 E:0.116588 |  So there we are, Harry Kane extends his record.
[1261.36 - 1265.76] P:1798.79 E:0.110295 |  That's 13 goals now that he scored at World Cups
[1265.76 - 1269.00] P:1615.69 E:0.111469 |  and at European Championship tournaments,
[1269.00 - 1271.64] P:1642.93 E:0.112714 |  extending the record for an England player.
[1271.64 - 1273.84] P:1711.62 E:0.118819 |  Long ball downfield for England to deal with.
[1273.84 - 1275.16] P:1570.80 E:0.104539 |  Stones is under that.
[1275.16 - 1278.24] P:1677.14 E:0.108271 |  Here's Walker, Walker, who I would have thought
[1278.24 - 1279.60] P:1719.59 E:0.105310 |  should get an assist for that goal,
[1279.60 - 1281.60] P:1604.79 E:0.112258 |  even though there were deflections involved.
[1281.60 - 1285.60] P:1660.16 E:0.109338 |  Victor Christensen, who is the man caught out,
[1285.60 - 1289.20] P:1617.81 E:0.112570 |  Alester City man, receives the ball on the left-hand side.
[1289.20 - 1290.40] P:1692.03 E:0.117449 |  Christensen looks for the cross,
[1290.40 - 1292.80] P:1609.29 E:0.114850 |  it's come off, walk advances into the penalty area,
[1292.80 - 1296.20] P:1617.06 E:0.099157 |  then the cross from Christian Eriksen, but that's blocked.
[1296.20 - 1299.40] P:1663.16 E:0.109563 |  And then Bukai Osaka in his own penalty area controls
[1299.40 - 1301.40] P:1831.18 E:0.106528 |  and hits it away downfield.
[1301.40 - 1305.20] P:1666.67 E:0.103166 |  So in the first match, England scored in the 13th minute,
[1305.20 - 1308.00] P:1636.88 E:0.102847 |  and they've got a goal in the 18th minute here.
[1308.00 - 1311.00] P:1600.94 E:0.106905 |  We said, didn't we, Matt, at the start of this tournament,
[1311.00 - 1313.80] P:1626.36 E:0.108035 |  it is absolutely not rocket science,
[1313.80 - 1316.20] P:1505.49 E:0.114577 |  but how important it was for Bellingham and Kane
[1316.20 - 1319.28] P:1527.36 E:0.118227 |  to contribute in England's first two goals,
[1319.28 - 1323.20] P:1597.00 E:0.110489 |  goalers at the tournament, Bellingham and Kane.
[1323.20 - 1326.60] P:1580.18 E:0.115319 |  As England go out to Naila on the right-hand side,
[1326.60 - 1329.92] P:1595.32 E:0.123052 |  Denmark, who took the lead in the semi-final three years ago,
[1329.92 - 1333.08] P:1569.41 E:0.105463 |  but England won here in Frankfurt.
[1333.08 - 1336.40] P:1560.25 E:0.115501 |  England have taken the lead in this second group match,
[1336.40 - 1339.16] P:1508.09 E:0.115752 |  and it is Denmark though in possession.
[1339.16 - 1342.60] P:1472.34 E:0.118618 |  And it is Andreas Christensen.
[1342.60 - 1346.36] P:1525.17 E:0.112774 |  Now over there to the right-hand side, to Joachim Andersen.
[1346.36 - 1350.84] P:1412.69 E:0.108887 |  Naila again on the right flank, back to Joachim Andersen.
[1350.84 - 1354.04] P:1588.11 E:0.117554 |  England have dropped right back in possession on the edge of the area.
[1354.04 - 1355.72] P:1842.90 E:0.116946 |  Excellent challenge from Reiss.
[1355.72 - 1359.40] P:1759.87 E:0.113436 |  Then in comes the challenge that ricochets back into the England penalty area.
[1359.40 - 1364.04] P:1753.31 E:0.110081 |  Trippie battling for it, which he does against Maila,
[1364.04 - 1368.44] P:1829.90 E:0.116308 |  and then clears it downfield, and rather politely, the offside flank goes up.
[1368.72 - 1371.72] P:1925.55 E:0.116663 |  Even though Trippie was involved in quite the puzzle there,
[1371.72 - 1374.92] P:1906.31 E:0.119172 |  and eventually the Black Country need to create a lead to England, who lead 1-0.
[1374.92 - 1378.36] P:1882.75 E:0.107017 |  I think seeing England after we score,
[1378.36 - 1380.40] P:1853.20 E:0.113097 |  how we behave, what positions we take up,
[1380.40 - 1383.24] P:1679.21 E:0.106793 |  how we can then settle the game down a little bit,
[1383.24 - 1387.96] P:1724.33 E:0.098626 |  or even be more aggressive and not allow Denmark to have a reaction.
[1387.96 - 1389.96] P:1624.60 E:0.107127 |  I think that's the important thing in the next few minutes,
[1389.96 - 1392.04] P:1659.01 E:0.102921 |  as I look at the tackle on Declan Rice a moment ago,
[1392.04 - 1394.04] P:1714.66 E:0.103837 |  it really gets clattered up in the air,
[1394.04 - 1397.76] P:1558.73 E:0.102878 |  and again, massive chunk of turf all over the pitch,
[1397.76 - 1400.32] P:1741.77 E:0.112111 |  and Trippie are using his body really well, actually,
[1400.32 - 1403.32] P:1735.52 E:0.111312 |  as he has to kind of manoeuvre his way into the ball.
[1405.00 - 1407.60] P:1714.81 E:0.121629 |  Jordan Pegford goes long looking for Kane,
[1407.60 - 1409.72] P:1443.58 E:0.113904 |  but Andreas Christensen wins that,
[1409.72 - 1412.64] P:1576.96 E:0.110657 |  and here is Christian Eriksson through the middle.
[1412.64 - 1415.40] P:1752.29 E:0.109527 |  And then a little pass up towards Vint,
[1415.40 - 1417.40] P:1549.29 E:0.113522 |  now Maila on the right-hand side.
[1417.40 - 1422.96] P:1538.63 E:0.118618 |  Infield, it comes to Morton Hulman, no relation to the coach.
[1422.96 - 1424.88] P:1546.92 E:0.111535 |  Caspar Maila with a cross into Trippie,
[1424.88 - 1428.32] P:1677.67 E:0.115354 |  that bounces out of play for a throw in 10 yards away from the corner flag.
[1428.32 - 1430.40] P:1701.63 E:0.110372 |  That's down in the Danish section,
[1430.40 - 1433.96] P:1488.77 E:0.119684 |  where all of those red flags with the white cross
[1433.96 - 1437.00] P:1499.54 E:0.117444 |  are hanging at various points around the two tiers,
[1437.00 - 1440.88] P:1650.53 E:0.112543 |  in amongst all of the colourful livery of Euro 2024.
[1440.88 - 1444.20] P:1630.46 E:0.117185 |  Throw in taken, Daringham, just a heavy touch from him,
[1444.20 - 1446.64] P:1623.80 E:0.115296 |  so Vint has it on the right-hand side,
[1446.64 - 1448.64] P:1657.40 E:0.117308 |  goes for the cross for the outside of his boot,
[1448.64 - 1450.64] P:1768.68 E:0.114014 |  but it's blocked away by Daringham,
[1450.64 - 1453.28] P:1470.04 E:0.116969 |  a play for a throw in to Denmark, 10 yards back from the corner flag.
[1453.28 - 1455.28] P:1575.30 E:0.106006 |  Maila takes it, back to Joachim Andersen.
[1455.28 - 1457.84] P:1568.97 E:0.105512 |  Joachim Andersen takes that down, knocks it in field,
[1457.84 - 1460.52] P:1468.69 E:0.114369 |  and Christian Eriksson thought about the ball into the area,
[1460.52 - 1463.72] P:1593.79 E:0.102737 |  in fact goes cute, now it bounces out back towards the edge of the box.
[1463.72 - 1466.96] P:1769.88 E:0.108469 |  Christian Eriksson again, goes past Alexander-Arnold,
[1466.96 - 1470.68] P:1699.77 E:0.106758 |  then shoots, deflected up in the air, half-headed away by Reiss,
[1470.68 - 1473.36] P:1675.35 E:0.106706 |  bounces near the penalty spot, Saka heads it further away,
[1473.36 - 1475.36] P:1657.13 E:0.094212 |  but only back to Denmark, and then Vint,
[1475.36 - 1477.36] P:1777.63 E:0.110722 |  the Christensen's ball across the penalty area,
[1477.36 - 1479.36] P:1957.75 E:0.114459 |  was blocked out for a throw on the left.
[1479.36 - 1481.84] P:1910.31 E:0.114813 |  Yeah, a bit of pressure on England.
[1481.88 - 1484.76] P:1909.52 E:0.112766 |  The Danish fans really getting up behind their team.
[1484.76 - 1489.08] P:1740.94 E:0.096331 |  They've not really got hold of the ball since England scored,
[1489.08 - 1492.08] P:1781.38 E:0.115655 |  and they do need a bit of time and a bit of a passage of play,
[1492.08 - 1494.88] P:1786.76 E:0.108075 |  of just possession, just to ease things a little bit.
[1494.88 - 1497.88] P:1688.55 E:0.108212 |  It's just balancing the game, kind of managing the game better.
[1498.88 - 1502.88] P:1552.06 E:0.110252 |  That was poor from Denmark, heavy touch from Hoibje,
[1502.88 - 1506.68] P:1631.91 E:0.107863 |  and it bounced out of play for a throw for England,
[1506.68 - 1509.20] P:1633.82 E:0.110837 |  10 yards away from their own corner flag.
[1509.24 - 1512.96] P:1727.81 E:0.107353 |  So far so good for England, midway through the first half.
[1512.96 - 1514.96] P:1741.59 E:0.107221 |  England leading through that left foot,
[1514.96 - 1516.96] P:1782.65 E:0.102905 |  six-yard finish from Harry Kane,
[1516.96 - 1519.96] P:1782.69 E:0.102880 |  his 64th goal for England,
[1519.96 - 1524.96] P:1463.80 E:0.110990 |  in what is his 93rd appearance for the record scorer, Hoibje Adon.
[1524.96 - 1527.96] P:1589.49 E:0.095015 |  Denmark, since the goal, have responded well.
[1529.96 - 1534.96] P:1445.01 E:0.105137 |  Vint, with his blonde hair, bobbin, plays it in field to Kulman.
[1534.96 - 1537.96] P:1459.64 E:0.107952 |  Andreas Christensen to Joakim Andersen.
[1537.96 - 1541.72] P:1359.37 E:0.110465 |  Now Mailer on the right-hand side, just gets away, finds a bit of space.
[1541.72 - 1544.72] P:1484.59 E:0.119430 |  Christian Eriksson drops deep, he's found space as well,
[1544.72 - 1548.72] P:1372.92 E:0.109393 |  and then just rolls the pass back towards Mailer on the right-hand side.
[1548.72 - 1550.72] P:1557.46 E:0.103956 |  Joakim Andersen puts his foot on the ball,
[1550.72 - 1553.72] P:1525.27 E:0.104459 |  now Hoibje with the pass out to Mailer on the right.
[1553.72 - 1555.72] P:1642.81 E:0.109737 |  Mailer came into the Danish side,
[1555.72 - 1558.72] P:1709.17 E:0.108695 |  cross from Joakim Andersen into the penalty area, which is headed down,
[1558.72 - 1561.72] P:1908.40 E:0.108722 |  but John Stones was doing his job there against Vint,
[1561.72 - 1563.72] P:1848.16 E:0.104301 |  and it was a weak header down straight at Pickford.
[1563.72 - 1565.72] P:1825.92 E:0.115116 |  Yeah, it was, it was a horrible ball to deal with,
[1565.72 - 1568.72] P:1901.15 E:0.106433 |  I have to say, does well, Stones, because he knows he can't edit,
[1568.72 - 1571.72] P:1868.02 E:0.113220 |  because he can't move his feet and then jump to head the ball.
[1571.72 - 1574.72] P:1840.76 E:0.108921 |  He's just got to use his body back into the centre forward
[1574.72 - 1578.72] P:1756.97 E:0.096885 |  and just stop him getting a clean header, and he does that really well, John Stones.
[1578.72 - 1584.72] P:1523.74 E:0.101045 |  So Rice now just walking the ball away from his penalty area, up towards Saka.
[1584.72 - 1587.72] P:1645.64 E:0.114486 |  Declan Rice has a look, there is a run from centrefield from Bellingham.
[1587.72 - 1591.72] P:1763.99 E:0.106832 |  Rice tries to find him, Kasper Schmeichel comes out to the extreme left of his penalty area,
[1591.72 - 1596.72] P:1727.36 E:0.112839 |  and is able to field the bouncing ball, just under-arms it out quickly.
[1596.72 - 1600.72] P:1746.50 E:0.105593 |  Kasper Schmeichel, 37 years old now, Kasper Schmeichel,
[1600.72 - 1606.72] P:1643.56 E:0.103979 |  a grand old man of the Danish team, winning his 103rd cap tonight.
[1606.72 - 1610.72] P:1526.64 E:0.104143 |  Still not as many as his dad, who is up here in the stand with us.
[1610.72 - 1615.72] P:1519.57 E:0.099631 |  Mailer on the right-hand side, Mailer's pulled down into the full-back position.
[1615.72 - 1617.72] P:1485.17 E:0.096946 |  Joakim Andersen.
[1617.72 - 1623.72] P:1507.61 E:0.108233 |  Now back again towards the half-way line, Hoidea, Christian Eriksen.
[1623.72 - 1628.72] P:1554.51 E:0.109736 |  Denmark have really had most of the possession since England took the lead,
[1628.72 - 1633.72] P:1564.47 E:0.101224 |  but in comes the challenge from Tripp, however that bounces back to Joakim Andersen,
[1633.72 - 1637.72] P:1511.65 E:0.105403 |  and then back into the centre-circle where Janak Vestegard,
[1637.72 - 1639.72] P:1442.45 E:0.108255 |  the other Leicester man in this starting line-up.
[1639.72 - 1642.72] P:1666.89 E:0.116210 |  And now Christian Eriksen on the edge of the area, trying to find a position.
[1642.72 - 1646.72] P:1822.68 E:0.104614 |  England players dive in, stretch away from Rice, and then very calm.
[1646.72 - 1653.72] P:1985.92 E:0.118388 |  Lovely footwork on the edge of his own penalty area for England from Jude Bellingham.
[1653.72 - 1659.72] P:1964.67 E:0.109112 |  That was classy, just to snuff out the danger as England come with Saka
[1659.72 - 1661.72] P:1887.74 E:0.124261 |  through the middle challenge in on him.
[1661.72 - 1664.72] P:1918.01 E:0.121745 |  No, it is given us a free-kick. Any yellow card as well.
[1664.72 - 1667.72] P:1964.87 E:0.118169 |  Cheers from the England fans. Vestegard, yellow carded.
[1667.72 - 1669.72] P:1937.53 E:0.110671 |  That's interesting in the context of the game.
[1669.72 - 1671.72] P:1973.32 E:0.103532 |  Yeah, it is. Vestegard just caught there.
[1671.72 - 1674.72] P:1828.21 E:0.101890 |  Saka had the run, and once he touches the ball past him,
[1674.72 - 1676.72] P:1804.85 E:0.106773 |  he's only ever going to bring him down.
[1676.72 - 1678.72] P:1682.84 E:0.098155 |  It is a yellow card, it's a cynical tack.
[1678.72 - 1681.72] P:1609.38 E:0.108145 |  I think Saka was bursting through the middle, but Jude Bellingham.
[1681.72 - 1685.72] P:1561.80 E:0.103392 |  Every now and then, he hasn't been too active in this game so far,
[1685.72 - 1690.72] P:1656.02 E:0.103833 |  but he does something that you just have to marvel at the way he just shifts the ball.
[1690.72 - 1693.72] P:1562.99 E:0.106541 |  I mean, it was so smooth with it one side to the next.
[1693.72 - 1697.72] P:1651.90 E:0.106968 |  He's got that lovely, poison balance and the ability to move his body weight either side,
[1697.72 - 1701.72] P:1532.06 E:0.106260 |  and then the pass to Saka's wrapped in there is safe side, it's inch perfect.
[1701.72 - 1708.72] P:1629.96 E:0.102935 |  Listen, in 2006, I watched Zinedine Zidane play in this stadium against Brazil,
[1708.72 - 1710.72] P:1589.28 E:0.110894 |  and he was absolutely brilliant, the Real Madrid man,
[1710.72 - 1714.72] P:1587.59 E:0.109075 |  and that, what we've just seen there on the edge of his move,
[1714.72 - 1717.72] P:1623.81 E:0.099370 |  was the right out of the Zidane playbook.
[1717.72 - 1720.72] P:1689.51 E:0.103685 |  One Nell England lead free-kick, which is taken short actually by Trippi,
[1720.72 - 1723.72] P:1629.38 E:0.100922 |  it's Alexander-Arnold. Alexander-Arnold dips it over the top,
[1723.72 - 1726.72] P:1783.41 E:0.103012 |  stretched by Gay, but he couldn't turn it across the six-yard box
[1726.72 - 1734.72] P:1809.51 E:0.097659 |  where Harry Kane was looking, of course, but straight out wide into the side netting for a goal kick.
[1734.72 - 1736.72] P:1630.11 E:0.106037 |  Yeah, I mean, it's been a while since the goal, hasn't it?
[1736.72 - 1743.72] P:1640.42 E:0.097050 |  And England not really being able to be as confident and as authoritative as what they were before the goal
[1743.72 - 1749.72] P:1625.59 E:0.096000 |  in terms of possession, territory, and at the moment, we just, yeah,
[1749.72 - 1752.72] P:1677.90 E:0.106002 |  having to get about the pitch a little bit and defend the edge of the box,
[1752.72 - 1755.72] P:1619.96 E:0.098698 |  and we kind of tend in a little bit.
[1755.72 - 1760.72] P:1738.29 E:0.103660 |  I can almost hear the armchair critics from back home
[1760.72 - 1764.72] P:1636.88 E:0.106711 |  and know exactly what they'll be saying if they're watching this on BBC One.
[1764.72 - 1769.72] P:1429.73 E:0.099106 |  Here is now Andreas Christensen to the centre-circle,
[1769.72 - 1772.72] P:1502.02 E:0.103151 |  to Morton Hulman, who plays in Lisbon for Sporting,
[1772.72 - 1774.72] P:1555.50 E:0.113670 |  just won the lead there with Ruben Amarim,
[1774.72 - 1777.72] P:1577.21 E:0.104340 |  then balled to the edge of the penalty area, flipped away by Forden,
[1777.72 - 1781.72] P:1510.80 E:0.104418 |  comes back to Joachim Aniston, and again the Dains take over,
[1781.72 - 1785.72] P:1487.39 E:0.103945 |  control of the possession, Hoibier, Hoibier up to the corner of the box,
[1785.72 - 1789.72] P:1612.98 E:0.103231 |  still going into the penalty area, and then he has shepherded, no he's not,
[1789.72 - 1792.72] P:1795.44 E:0.103243 |  he's managed to work it across to Pickford, Pickford came for it, didn't get it,
[1792.72 - 1795.72] P:1810.37 E:0.113634 |  the ball rattles across the penalty area and bounces harmlessly back to Pickford,
[1795.72 - 1800.72] P:1795.16 E:0.107641 |  who's able to scoop it up, not terribly convincing from England defensively.
[1800.72 - 1804.72] P:1783.94 E:0.110806 |  It's a hairy moment out of absolutely nowhere, really.
[1804.72 - 1807.72] P:1827.25 E:0.108766 |  I mean, the ball was kept in play brilliantly.
[1807.72 - 1811.72] P:1841.09 E:0.111375 |  He was Hoiland who, Ericsson actually gets across the face of Pickford,
[1811.72 - 1814.72] P:1726.91 E:0.111124 |  who has to kind of break himself from taking him down,
[1814.72 - 1817.72] P:1725.72 E:0.102376 |  then tries to feed the ball in, and ricocheted through the ball,
[1817.72 - 1821.72] P:1609.45 E:0.099436 |  and eventually, trying to Alexander-Arnold, just gets a nick on it,
[1821.72 - 1823.72] P:1600.28 E:0.112857 |  and it rolls back into Pickford, it was a little bit messy.
[1823.72 - 1827.72] P:1751.19 E:0.109101 |  Let's go down pitch side again behind the Pickford goal, is he Christensen?
[1827.72 - 1830.72] P:1605.76 E:0.114777 |  Yeah, there's no coincidence that Denmark are starting to dominate,
[1830.72 - 1835.72] P:1694.22 E:0.113797 |  because that man, Christian Ericsson, he's at the centre of everything that Denmark are doing.
[1835.72 - 1838.72] P:1652.15 E:0.115992 |  I would say that the Danish midfield is dominating so far.
[1838.72 - 1841.72] P:1726.75 E:0.106253 |  They're starting to get a little bit of possession in and around that box,
[1841.72 - 1844.72] P:1795.40 E:0.113104 |  and they're doing really well, but I know exactly what you're referring to, John,
[1844.72 - 1847.72] P:1758.63 E:0.110560 |  with the armchair fans back home, I know what you're thinking,
[1847.72 - 1850.72] P:1746.53 E:0.112343 |  but on that occasion, if I am thinking what you're thinking,
[1850.72 - 1852.72] P:1614.74 E:0.119099 |  Trent Alexander-Arnold, excellent track in the midfield,
[1852.72 - 1854.72] P:1665.63 E:0.112380 |  to just stop Denmark getting through then.
[1854.72 - 1856.72] P:1750.70 E:0.111550 |  Thank you very much, Izzy.
[1856.72 - 1860.72] P:1573.43 E:0.111682 |  Another England international part of our team here, as Guy clears the ball away
[1860.72 - 1864.72] P:1631.45 E:0.106731 |  from inside his own penalty area, which Walker is able to get it down against,
[1864.72 - 1868.72] P:1728.66 E:0.103849 |  Christian Ericsson, then back into the penalty area, the John Stones,
[1868.72 - 1871.72] P:1870.18 E:0.116661 |  across the six-yard box to Pickford, all in yellow,
[1871.72 - 1875.72] P:1718.65 E:0.106162 |  left-footed away towards the goal scorer, Harry Kane, near the half-way line,
[1875.72 - 1878.72] P:1534.67 E:0.109428 |  and then Jude Bellingham is surrounded by red shirts,
[1878.72 - 1881.72] P:1704.70 E:0.108266 |  and Hulmunder's won the ball back, and now Koybjerg.
[1881.72 - 1884.72] P:1839.30 E:0.116233 |  Mailer's got space on the right-hand side, he's one-on-one with Tripp here,
[1884.72 - 1887.72] P:1658.05 E:0.101233 |  in fact, he plays it to Vint inside the penalty area.
[1887.72 - 1890.72] P:1652.74 E:0.098321 |  Jönes Vint back out to Mailer. Mailer's crossed to the back post.
[1890.72 - 1893.72] P:1790.51 E:0.107151 |  Pickford calls for it, comes for it, there was no-one there for Denmark.
[1893.72 - 1898.72] P:1755.10 E:0.102006 |  He went for it, just got a hand to it, and England have dealt with it in the end,
[1898.72 - 1901.72] P:1723.04 E:0.108997 |  and cleared it away. Actually, Walker to Saka, and Saka's off on a run.
[1901.72 - 1905.72] P:1830.31 E:0.111325 |  He's off on a streak up the right wing, but Andreas Christensen comes in
[1905.72 - 1908.72] P:1845.23 E:0.118415 |  with a challenge, and the ball runs away, even though Saka ends up on the ground.
[1908.72 - 1910.72] P:1819.27 E:0.109558 |  Yeah, he was kind of going into a bit of a dead end.
[1910.72 - 1912.72] P:1817.69 E:0.110840 |  I mean, he's getting the ball up the pitch really well there, Saka,
[1912.72 - 1916.72] P:1783.00 E:0.107797 |  but he's just ran out of space, and too many Danish players who are actually really pressing.
[1916.72 - 1919.72] P:1663.57 E:0.105382 |  Well, not given England any time on the ball,
[1919.72 - 1922.72] P:1676.99 E:0.099102 |  we tried to play out just before that, but it was...
[1922.72 - 1926.72] P:1717.37 E:0.103493 |  Every pass was just not quite getting there in terms of the pressure was on,
[1926.72 - 1930.72] P:1726.44 E:0.103017 |  so it was forcing a difficult touch, and then the pass to the next person wasn't quite right,
[1930.72 - 1934.72] P:1615.02 E:0.107192 |  and the Danes turned the ball over, spraying it wide,
[1934.72 - 1937.72] P:1645.41 E:0.109234 |  and then all of a sudden we defended our box as a difficult ten minutes for England.
[1937.72 - 1942.72] P:1678.44 E:0.114600 |  Yep. England leading through that Harry Kane goal that was set up by Kyle Walker,
[1942.72 - 1948.72] P:1648.76 E:0.111992 |  and a couple of ricochets in absolute meet-and-drink to him.
[1948.72 - 1954.72] P:1788.44 E:0.114034 |  As he pounced on the edge of the six-yard box, and buried it away for his first goal at the tournament.
[1954.72 - 1957.72] P:1708.34 E:0.105635 |  He has Mala though, and Denmark have been on top since then.
[1957.72 - 1960.72] P:1684.42 E:0.110772 |  Mala again, he's seen a lot of the ball, Vint on the edge of the area.
[1960.72 - 1964.72] P:1608.99 E:0.107573 |  Back it comes to Hoipjärg, top of the man who's not really played too much,
[1964.72 - 1966.72] P:1640.68 E:0.104334 |  first-burst this season, breaks into the penalty area.
[1966.72 - 1972.72] P:1794.89 E:0.106564 |  Vint for the chance, Gaye comes across, and as the shot was hit, as he slipped Vint,
[1972.72 - 1975.72] P:1769.57 E:0.117653 |  the deflection took it, looping across the face of goal,
[1975.72 - 1977.72] P:1833.99 E:0.111919 |  but it landed on the roof of the net.
[1977.72 - 1979.72] P:1959.65 E:0.112950 |  A good reaction from Gaye.
[1979.72 - 1984.72] P:1887.53 E:0.112521 |  The ball just spins from the middle, I think it's Trent Alexander-Arnold gets a touch,
[1984.72 - 1987.72] P:1839.55 E:0.106636 |  and then it flicks down into the feet of Vint, who's at full stretch,
[1987.72 - 1991.72] P:1759.08 E:0.105718 |  but Gaye has to get across and gets a touch on it, which loops the ball up,
[1991.72 - 1997.72] P:1894.96 E:0.109285 |  and Pickford scrambling towards the back post, thinking it might just loop and drop into the goal,
[1997.72 - 1999.72] P:1873.19 E:0.104148 |  but it just bounces on top of the net.
[1999.72 - 2001.72] P:1761.40 E:0.112277 |  This pitch surface is terrible. Terrible.
[2001.72 - 2004.72] P:1845.26 E:0.103238 |  Terrible. I mean, it's cut him up severely.
[2004.72 - 2007.72] P:1720.52 E:0.104089 |  We didn't see anything in the warm-up, John, it didn't really carve up at all.
[2007.72 - 2010.72] P:1534.07 E:0.107379 |  Not that we'd known this. Anyway, it's a corner.
[2010.72 - 2014.72] P:1761.82 E:0.108457 |  First cut, Ericsson was going to play it in, but the referee blew his whistle,
[2014.72 - 2018.72] P:1937.21 E:0.118029 |  there's some pushing and shoving, so Kyle Walk has been called across,
[2018.72 - 2023.72] P:1945.30 E:0.109457 |  and Andreas Christensen for a telling off for them.
[2023.72 - 2027.72] P:1827.14 E:0.101325 |  The referee's done England a favour there, because it was a well-planned set piece,
[2027.72 - 2029.72] P:1792.26 E:0.094604 |  and they'd created the space.
[2029.72 - 2033.72] P:1701.70 E:0.103654 |  I don't know who it was coming round for the shot, but Ericsson played it kind of towards the penalty spot,
[2033.72 - 2038.72] P:1752.07 E:0.101677 |  and it was ripe for a first-time, ripe for effort, and the referee blows his whistle.
[2038.72 - 2040.72] P:1726.88 E:0.113368 |  They've given the game away. Now we're on to it.
[2040.72 - 2043.72] P:1677.33 E:0.103088 |  Absolutely. So, therefore, Pukajosaka is keeping an eye on Hulman.
[2043.72 - 2047.72] P:1742.95 E:0.111029 |  Ericsson then does take the whistle, it's gone again as it's headed over the top,
[2047.72 - 2050.72] P:1882.30 E:0.111728 |  and the referee's pointing at Walk Christensen.
[2050.72 - 2053.72] P:1914.08 E:0.109739 |  I would imagine. Or Vestergaard.
[2053.72 - 2059.72] P:1925.99 E:0.113498 |  Anyway, the referee was on it, and immediately gave the free kick in, lands away.
[2059.72 - 2064.72] P:1813.72 E:0.103793 |  Yeah, well, they had to play it long into the box then, but the Danes couldn't have been happy with that.
[2064.72 - 2068.72] P:1739.68 E:0.103937 |  I mean, you get one chance to play that kind of set play.
[2068.72 - 2072.72] P:1718.52 E:0.093537 |  They played the card, and the referee blew the whistle.
[2072.72 - 2078.72] P:1865.39 E:0.113000 |  So, it is a free kick then, but Pickford will take,
[2078.72 - 2084.72] P:1907.95 E:0.111484 |  and Rice receives it outside the penalty area, and back it goes to Marguer.
[2084.72 - 2087.72] P:1827.97 E:0.121229 |  You just have a little run forward, and then...
[2087.72 - 2090.72] P:1976.46 E:0.119750 |  He actually then collides with Vint.
[2090.72 - 2095.72] P:1941.84 E:0.122007 |  He'd overrun the ball, bounced away from him, and actually it's given England's way.
[2095.72 - 2100.72] P:1981.20 E:0.116697 |  I think it ricochets off Vint, but Marguer, he's just literally lifted up a chunk of turf
[2100.72 - 2102.72] P:1917.98 E:0.108264 |  and patted it down to his hand.
[2102.72 - 2105.72] P:1972.40 E:0.098923 |  It's like the horse of the year show.
[2105.72 - 2109.72] P:1862.86 E:0.097664 |  I mean, he's overran it. He's not got too many options.
[2109.72 - 2112.72] P:1798.31 E:0.111246 |  Crossfield pass, that's given it away.
[2112.72 - 2114.72] P:1811.88 E:0.102395 |  Now, Victor Christensen.
[2114.72 - 2116.72] P:1995.36 E:0.115858 |  Then he's shot from distances in!
[2116.72 - 2118.72] P:2077.25 E:0.119535 |  What an effort that is!
[2118.72 - 2121.72] P:2022.26 E:0.118614 |  It's the equaliser from Morton Hulman.
[2121.72 - 2125.72] P:2022.07 E:0.114949 |  Best part of 30 yards, it's fizzed low across the turf.
[2125.72 - 2129.72] P:1940.49 E:0.109857 |  Pickford diving down to his right, in off the foot of the post,
[2129.72 - 2132.72] P:1834.08 E:0.114760 |  and Denmark have the equaliser. It's 1-1.
[2132.72 - 2134.72] P:1887.50 E:0.106801 |  What a hit.
[2134.72 - 2138.72] P:1873.56 E:0.108076 |  That is some strike from the midfield player.
[2138.72 - 2140.72] P:1883.46 E:0.109975 |  And it's deserved.
[2140.72 - 2143.72] P:1899.82 E:0.113436 |  Denmark have been far the better team since the goal.
[2143.72 - 2146.72] P:1917.10 E:0.114884 |  Completely dominant, applying all the pressure,
[2146.72 - 2149.72] P:1858.74 E:0.108232 |  and you can just feel that goal coming.
[2149.72 - 2151.72] P:1863.91 E:0.116551 |  But I didn't expect it to be as good as that, John.
[2151.72 - 2156.72] P:1796.08 E:0.106220 |  What a strike. That's a fair way out as the ball comes out to the edge of the box.
[2156.72 - 2158.72] P:1809.67 E:0.109378 |  It's a poor pass from Harry Kane.
[2158.72 - 2161.72] P:1818.88 E:0.116002 |  He's trying to hit a Crossfield ball, but he gives it away cleanly.
[2161.72 - 2166.72] P:1710.94 E:0.112165 |  It gets popped into Hulman, and he pings it with his right foot low.
[2166.72 - 2170.72] P:1720.21 E:0.113842 |  The real driving shot across the goal doesn't touch anyone on the way in,
[2170.72 - 2173.72] P:1731.49 E:0.112060 |  but bangs off the inside of the post and into the back of the net.
[2173.72 - 2175.72] P:1680.74 E:0.106457 |  It's a brilliant hit from the Dane.
[2175.72 - 2179.72] P:1740.20 E:0.109375 |  That ball went into the net, almost under the nose of Izzy Christensen.
[2179.72 - 2183.72] P:1707.60 E:0.116050 |  I'll tell you what, I was right in the far end line behind the goal.
[2183.72 - 2187.72] P:1852.00 E:0.118300 |  What a finish from Hulman, but the shape from England,
[2187.72 - 2190.72] P:1826.74 E:0.109346 |  a loose Crossfield pass, sorry.
[2190.72 - 2193.72] P:1662.55 E:0.104965 |  They just capitalised the Danes and it was coming, as Matt said.
[2194.72 - 2197.72] P:1913.49 E:0.128560 |  They're bringing Connor as well. Connor-Claude, who's here.
[2197.72 - 2200.72] P:1846.92 E:0.104305 |  Yeah, they say, I think you're right, guys.
[2200.72 - 2202.72] P:1768.51 E:0.119175 |  I didn't get the goals being coming.
[2202.72 - 2205.72] P:1708.98 E:0.113677 |  I think Denmark sees the England goal being fantastic.
[2205.72 - 2207.72] P:1880.57 E:0.116819 |  They're playing with a real narrow front clear.
[2207.72 - 2209.72] P:1871.67 E:0.112306 |  Don't know if you've seen it. They're not here.
[2209.72 - 2211.72] P:1740.42 E:0.120547 |  The front clear really narrow, Eric Suen Wins,
[2211.72 - 2213.72] P:1786.53 E:0.115107 |  and obviously Hulman down the middle,
[2213.72 - 2215.72] P:1832.27 E:0.107284 |  and they're just causing England problems,
[2215.72 - 2218.72] P:1806.12 E:0.114281 |  just in between Stones and Trent Alexander-Arnold and Declan Rice and Mark,
[2218.72 - 2220.72] P:1845.31 E:0.116144 |  and no-one knows how to pick them up.
[2220.72 - 2224.72] P:1906.45 E:0.111490 |  It's a massive shift between that of us in possession since we scored the goal.
[2224.72 - 2228.72] P:1898.46 E:0.112864 |  Before that, it's really dominant that you get the goal,
[2228.72 - 2232.72] P:1888.70 E:0.112807 |  but there's a psychological shift that we're not having the ball in the same fashion.
[2232.72 - 2235.72] P:1823.09 E:0.114901 |  Yeah, 100%. I'd just like Denmark into the game a little bit more,
[2235.72 - 2237.72] P:1715.15 E:0.107197 |  unless they've been fantastic since the goal.
[2237.72 - 2239.72] P:1813.42 E:0.112451 |  It was a fantastic goal themselves,
[2239.72 - 2242.72] P:1695.48 E:0.101485 |  but we just need to try and wrestle control back of the game a little bit.
[2242.72 - 2245.72] P:1713.14 E:0.104556 |  All out of play for a throw-in after England are pegged back.
[2245.72 - 2248.72] P:1807.28 E:0.104221 |  Hulman equalising his first goal for his country.
[2248.72 - 2251.72] P:1698.31 E:0.104303 |  Not bad, is it, to get off the mark like that.
[2251.72 - 2255.72] P:1563.75 E:0.108532 |  Best part of 30 yards, and pinpoint into the bottom corner
[2255.72 - 2259.72] P:1767.32 E:0.111851 |  after Harry Kane, England's goal scorer, gave the ball away.
[2259.72 - 2262.72] P:1849.43 E:0.103015 |  Now here's another one forward for Denmark,
[2262.72 - 2265.72] P:1715.00 E:0.100981 |  just after England have conceded at the tournament for the first time.
[2265.72 - 2268.72] P:1771.46 E:0.105025 |  Five-life BBC sounds, Walker over the halfway line.
[2268.72 - 2272.72] P:1774.42 E:0.114248 |  Walker, though, runs into the figure of Christian Suen, who comes out with the ball.
[2272.72 - 2277.72] P:1675.76 E:0.110316 |  Denmark have got their tails up here, Mela then Vint runs away from Rice.
[2277.72 - 2282.72] P:1888.06 E:0.121804 |  Oh, the referee's given the free kick when Mela was running away with the ball
[2282.72 - 2285.72] P:1939.21 E:0.111164 |  at the England defence, and the whistles from the Denmark fans.
[2285.72 - 2288.72] P:1887.91 E:0.106849 |  He's doing us the right favour at the moment, the referee.
[2288.72 - 2293.72] P:1812.17 E:0.103654 |  I mean, he's stopped the play, it ricocheted into the part of Mela's got the run,
[2293.72 - 2297.72] P:1655.49 E:0.109840 |  and it's probably a 2v1 with Poiland making a dart and run into the box as well.
[2297.72 - 2303.72] P:1684.09 E:0.115402 |  I mean, that was an important intervention from the referee from an England perspective.
[2303.72 - 2307.72] P:1655.07 E:0.113161 |  He'll be kicking himself as a professional as a referee.
[2307.72 - 2310.72] P:1812.27 E:0.116119 |  He will know that he should have let it go.
[2310.72 - 2313.72] P:1532.62 E:0.094287 |  So that could have been big trouble for England.
[2313.72 - 2315.72] P:1705.03 E:0.097340 |  We're in trouble at the moment.
[2315.72 - 2319.72] P:1661.53 E:0.105860 |  We've not got to grips with this game, the space that the Danes are having in that area.
[2319.72 - 2324.72] P:1653.84 E:0.105495 |  Ericsson, especially as Izzy said, picking up the ball and the midfield players are completely on top of it,
[2324.72 - 2329.72] P:1685.06 E:0.111070 |  and we're just having to sit off at the moment, we're not able to really get any pressure.
[2330.72 - 2335.72] P:1830.04 E:0.114563 |  Yeah, having opened the scoring in the way that they did,
[2335.72 - 2343.72] P:1601.79 E:0.108179 |  England have just conceded possession, conceded space, they now conceded the goal.
[2343.72 - 2348.72] P:1692.52 E:0.108347 |  So it's 1-1, he has Mela again, and then through it goes to the goal scorer.
[2348.72 - 2352.72] P:1770.67 E:0.110351 |  Hulmand on his right foot again, shoots and that's deflected away by Trent Alexander-Arnold.
[2352.72 - 2354.72] P:1953.47 E:0.114206 |  Far too much space for Hulmand.
[2354.72 - 2356.72] P:1927.00 E:0.111111 |  That's all hands to the pump at the moment.
[2356.72 - 2360.72] P:1878.15 E:0.111475 |  Alexander-Arnold coming across to get the block, but the distance is so vast,
[2360.72 - 2364.72] P:1868.95 E:0.109485 |  he shouldn't be able to pick up the ball there, turn, have a touch out of his feet,
[2364.72 - 2366.72] P:1881.43 E:0.106614 |  and then a challenge comes in.
[2366.72 - 2369.72] P:1830.83 E:0.116401 |  I just think in terms of midfield, we've got to be a little bit tighter,
[2369.72 - 2372.72] P:1857.25 E:0.112491 |  we've dropped off so much because we've got so deep, we've been under pressure,
[2372.72 - 2375.72] P:1825.28 E:0.105121 |  and now the space is there for the Danes to play.
[2375.72 - 2377.72] P:1525.26 E:0.112540 |  England are rocking here, 1-1.
[2377.72 - 2381.72] P:1457.36 E:0.111753 |  Christian Ericsson who created all those chances in the opening match from set pieces.
[2381.72 - 2385.72] P:1745.07 E:0.110561 |  Ericsson to the back post, a stretch in ahead or across, lands on the roof of the net
[2385.72 - 2390.72] P:1809.54 E:0.104759 |  from Joachim Anderson, Pickford stretching high, but was comfortable,
[2390.72 - 2396.72] P:1801.40 E:0.109176 |  and Pickford of all people comes forward and indicates that everyone should just calm down.
[2396.72 - 2398.72] P:1838.81 E:0.103344 |  Goal kick England.
[2398.72 - 2403.72] P:1857.68 E:0.115099 |  Oh, you've got to get hold of the ball, but it looks like it could be one of the short passes
[2403.72 - 2408.72] P:1918.49 E:0.112279 |  onto stones on the edge of the six-yard box, and the Danes are five all the way pushed in,
[2408.72 - 2412.72] P:1998.06 E:0.111484 |  Ericsson's all the way in, and they're more than happy to come and press us in this area of the pitch.
[2412.72 - 2418.72] P:1780.94 E:0.107210 |  Matt Upson played at the World Cup for England, taken short, then Mark win it back on the halfway line,
[2418.72 - 2421.72] P:1764.19 E:0.100639 |  and now Joachim Anderson again.
[2421.72 - 2426.72] P:1619.00 E:0.105558 |  This is concerning for England, concerning for Gareth Southgate, then Mark have scored their goal,
[2426.72 - 2430.72] P:1600.23 E:0.098758 |  and they haven't dropped back, they've carried on as they were before the goal.
[2430.72 - 2436.72] P:1742.45 E:0.102990 |  Although England now forced them to go all the way back to Kasper Schmeichel, left foot from him,
[2436.72 - 2441.72] P:1629.48 E:0.109911 |  over here, but Walker in the air wins that well, bounces across centrally, Foulden comes over,
[2441.72 - 2447.72] P:1786.65 E:0.115187 |  and then then Mark play it out from the back, play it round, Bellingham and Foulden,
[2447.72 - 2453.72] P:1775.15 E:0.112230 |  and now Joachim Anderson, the flying mailer on the right, Trippier tries to get there, the cross is over hit,
[2453.72 - 2457.72] P:1747.93 E:0.111498 |  and just drifts away behind, almost landing in amongst the Denmark fans.
[2457.72 - 2463.72] P:1651.31 E:0.115151 |  It's a goal kick, and it's one-one, and we've got just over five minutes to go to halftime.
[2463.72 - 2469.72] P:1598.87 E:0.108052 |  I think the space that they're finding is the concern for me, they get one or two passes off quickly,
[2469.72 - 2473.72] P:1878.93 E:0.107600 |  but all these efforts, I look at the goal, loads of space, time to get his head up, hit the shot,
[2473.72 - 2479.72] P:1948.64 E:0.118889 |  the second effort that got blocked, too much time to be able to get your head up as a midfield player
[2479.72 - 2483.72] P:1832.48 E:0.096826 |  and strike the ball from the edge of the box, got to get people out and put pressure.
[2483.72 - 2487.72] P:1764.96 E:0.101121 |  Pickford goes along with this, Kane gets the better of Andreas Christensen,
[2487.72 - 2490.72] P:1576.90 E:0.105120 |  tries to head it to Saka, but that's intercepted, and Hoibier is there,
[2490.72 - 2498.72] P:1707.60 E:0.107228 |  this is Tottenham and Arsenal, Hoibier and Saka, and then Declan Reis is able just to take the ball off the tour of Rasmus Hoiling,
[2498.72 - 2501.72] P:1894.03 E:0.102270 |  and knock it back to Pickford.
[2501.72 - 2507.72] P:1845.72 E:0.110816 |  So one-one the score, choice of listening as the Afghanistan-India match on Sports Extra right now at the T20 cricket,
[2507.72 - 2511.72] P:1796.75 E:0.109427 |  as Clodden starts in a run through the middle, he's beaten three men, still going,
[2511.72 - 2515.72] P:1900.47 E:0.108499 |  Kane ahead of him, he goes for goal himself and shoots straight at Schmeichel,
[2515.72 - 2519.72] P:1841.49 E:0.114987 |  who's able to just drop down to his left, and Kane looks at him and suggests,
[2519.72 - 2521.72] P:1768.36 E:0.098741 |  how about the pass to me?
[2521.72 - 2524.72] P:1749.76 E:0.096186 |  He's not that easy, that's as much as it gets from Harry Kane to say,
[2524.72 - 2528.72] P:1769.02 E:0.102564 |  why don't you pass me the ball? He made a run, and I think he felt Foden was just going to slip it to him,
[2528.72 - 2532.72] P:1617.62 E:0.094635 |  but Foden was on a run, he was very much off balance when he hit the shot,
[2532.72 - 2535.72] P:1673.02 E:0.103126 |  it'd been difficult to score from that kind of distance.
[2535.72 - 2539.72] P:1633.32 E:0.109876 |  That was dazzling from Foden, it was, I mean he danced past two or three didn't he?
[2539.72 - 2544.72] P:1676.25 E:0.106622 |  Yeah, and probably felt he had the right to go for it himself, having made the run.
[2544.72 - 2553.72] P:1758.17 E:0.101550 |  That terrific burst, leaving Danish players in his wake, but the shot was straight at Kasper Schmeichel,
[2553.72 - 2556.72] P:1776.41 E:0.099027 |  the underlap man as he is now.
[2556.72 - 2561.72] P:1729.21 E:0.110916 |  Here is Walker in possession, England just need to settle this now.
[2561.72 - 2566.72] P:1793.85 E:0.113279 |  They are in possession, Foden has dropped deep and given it to Walker,
[2566.72 - 2571.72] P:1790.74 E:0.101117 |  Walker and Saka together on the right hand side, back it comes towards Foden again,
[2571.72 - 2575.72] P:1674.75 E:0.104740 |  Foden goes in field towards Bellingham, who certainly not had the influence in this match,
[2575.72 - 2580.72] P:1755.53 E:0.106670 |  due to Bellingham that he had in the first half against Serbia on Sunday night.
[2581.72 - 2584.72] P:1845.53 E:0.120399 |  Alexander-Arnold now through the middle, Foden, this is Denner from England,
[2584.72 - 2588.72] P:1840.14 E:0.120198 |  whistles from the Danish supporters, now back to Dalingham again,
[2588.72 - 2591.72] P:1890.25 E:0.115150 |  and now England have got the ball inside the Danish half,
[2591.72 - 2594.72] P:1924.24 E:0.109199 |  but it feels like we've not seen this for such a long time in the match.
[2594.72 - 2598.72] P:1812.99 E:0.107077 |  Bellingham goes out towards the left hand side and in comes the challenge, bounces back to Trippia.
[2598.72 - 2602.72] P:1687.08 E:0.106148 |  Trippia's ball in the cane on the edge of the penalty area, that bounces off the captain,
[2602.72 - 2608.72] P:1788.36 E:0.113228 |  Rice couldn't get there, actually did well, did well against Vince, so England do keep possession.
[2608.72 - 2612.72] P:1617.44 E:0.106492 |  Bellingham again, over there on the left hand side, flick round the back of his leg,
[2612.72 - 2617.72] P:1648.19 E:0.113796 |  now Foden on the edge of the area, might be space for him, swings it in across the six-yard box
[2617.72 - 2619.72] P:1767.62 E:0.113490 |  beyond Saka and through for Golkin.
[2619.72 - 2623.72] P:1743.90 E:0.114931 |  That's much, much better, control build up, movement off the ball.
[2623.72 - 2624.72] P:1715.59 E:0.112870 |  But where's that been?
[2624.72 - 2628.72] P:1667.13 E:0.117269 |  Yeah, it's been popping it around, well it hasn't been there for 15 minutes or so,
[2628.72 - 2631.72] P:1604.88 E:0.116961 |  has it, since the goal and it's really put us on the back foot,
[2631.72 - 2633.72] P:1593.48 E:0.113108 |  but I don't mind the fact that Foden got his head up there,
[2633.72 - 2638.72] P:1609.30 E:0.117269 |  tried to look for Saka at the back post, it was nearly, nearly a really good ball.
[2638.72 - 2643.72] P:1553.90 E:0.103190 |  That's bringing Conor Caudi again, three minutes, two and a half minutes to the first half to go Conor.
[2643.72 - 2645.72] P:1656.99 E:0.111935 |  Yeah, that was a little bit better John, weren't it?
[2645.72 - 2649.72] P:1625.03 E:0.113127 |  Just having a little bit of control possession, working our way into where he is, getting full fold in the game.
[2649.72 - 2652.72] P:1496.03 E:0.110965 |  I just look at Denmark and they just look really comfortable with him without the ball,
[2652.72 - 2655.72] P:1709.62 E:0.116665 |  don't think they look like they know the formation, they look like they know what they're doing,
[2655.72 - 2657.72] P:1629.23 E:0.101940 |  they look like they're in control of everything that they're doing.
[2657.72 - 2660.72] P:1632.29 E:0.107462 |  So it's just up to England just to again wrestle that ball back again,
[2660.72 - 2664.72] P:1517.68 E:0.108147 |  have a couple of minutes with the ball, especially to half time now, it's important we don't continue another,
[2664.72 - 2666.72] P:1592.02 E:0.113743 |  at least you go into half time drawing the game.
[2666.72 - 2672.72] P:1598.94 E:0.109442 |  Yeah, but England lose it again in centre field, so Denmark have got the ball back
[2672.72 - 2678.72] P:1510.68 E:0.103353 |  and the Danes are just passing it around England here, Hulman, the Danish goal scorer,
[2678.72 - 2686.72] P:1657.63 E:0.104052 |  that Foden has given it away to Hoiland, now Hulman to the right-hand side to Meila,
[2686.72 - 2693.72] P:1705.11 E:0.103726 |  again Hulman, Hypeia picks out Meila, Meila's right foot across towards Hoiland,
[2693.72 - 2699.72] P:1819.66 E:0.109631 |  Gay does extremely well to win the header under pressure from that strong young number nine,
[2699.72 - 2702.72] P:1829.46 E:0.117488 |  Rasmus Hoiland, excellent defensive header from Gay.
[2702.72 - 2706.72] P:1845.02 E:0.109597 |  That was a brilliant header, full stretch, really got up high, I mean people talk about his height,
[2706.72 - 2711.72] P:1615.26 E:0.101978 |  he's not the tallest centre back you've ever seen but he doesn't have to get up well and head the ball.
[2712.72 - 2719.72] P:1619.77 E:0.104270 |  England could do with half time, just as Ericsson from deep to Huland on the edge of the penalty area
[2719.72 - 2724.72] P:1853.30 E:0.106115 |  as Manchester United team it, then it comes back for a curling shot which is straight as Pickford
[2724.72 - 2729.72] P:1841.68 E:0.116431 |  is able to pull it down here, Amiel Hoidjo from round about 25 yards went for the curl,
[2729.72 - 2730.72] P:1910.60 E:0.105996 |  a bit too close to Pickford.
[2730.72 - 2735.72] P:1896.57 E:0.114589 |  They've got to get to grips with Ericsson, he's just pulling strings, he's getting on the ball,
[2735.72 - 2741.72] P:1802.23 E:0.108816 |  he's making moves, he's playing passes, distances, just haven't been there at all from England,
[2741.72 - 2745.72] P:1716.51 E:0.108530 |  we've not been able to really stop the Dains and we've just given the ball away quite loosely.
[2745.72 - 2750.72] P:1707.89 E:0.107932 |  He made it away again so Hypeia gives it to Hoiland who's on the left hand side up against Stones
[2750.72 - 2754.72] P:1719.47 E:0.106286 |  and walk out, Hoiland pulls it across past the two Manchester City men but it's straight at Rice
[2754.72 - 2758.72] P:1759.75 E:0.111741 |  and Rice is in danger of losing it on the edge of the barter law, I think.
[2758.72 - 2760.72] P:1790.02 E:0.110992 |  Did he get the free kick? No he didn't.
[2760.72 - 2766.72] P:1838.44 E:0.113721 |  He didn't get the free kick, he was millimetres away from giving the ball away.
[2766.72 - 2773.72] P:1910.77 E:0.117244 |  Great cheer as the ball is won brilliantly for Denmark by Vestergaard who comes forward
[2773.72 - 2776.72] P:1972.60 E:0.119707 |  and nods it through but Pickford has got it at his feet.
[2776.72 - 2781.72] P:1953.12 E:0.109098 |  We've got 20 seconds of the first half to go and at the moment I think these thousands
[2781.72 - 2786.72] P:1769.98 E:0.102644 |  and thousands of England fans all around this stadium will be thinking and hoping this doesn't
[2786.72 - 2791.72] P:1727.46 E:0.104062 |  get any worse for England before half time. One-one full of promise when Harry Kane gave
[2791.72 - 2796.72] P:1625.47 E:0.094605 |  England the lead in the 18th minute but since then Denmark have dominated
[2796.72 - 2804.72] P:1635.12 E:0.099303 |  Hulman with equaliser and you could argue that they are fortunate that they aren't behind in this match.
[2804.72 - 2807.72] P:1628.66 E:0.096360 |  Walker, here is Bellingham.
[2807.72 - 2812.72] P:1513.40 E:0.106550 |  Kane stating the obvious England need to get Bellingham more involved in the game.
[2812.72 - 2816.72] P:1623.31 E:0.106168 |  Bellingham through to Folder. Now Sacher, little pass to Kane.
[2816.72 - 2823.72] P:1791.37 E:0.112959 |  Kane looks for Sacher but actually keeps possession and he's being followed by Christian Sundtich
[2823.72 - 2828.72] P:1643.36 E:0.106816 |  for Christian Sundtich. Alexander Arnald is caught in possession by Christian Ericsson.
[2828.72 - 2833.72] P:1471.40 E:0.109397 |  Kane is still out here on the right-hand side, Kane turns it in field and then Walker.
[2833.72 - 2837.72] P:1581.40 E:0.109482 |  Declan Rice just forward of the centre-circle, one minute of added time at the end of this first half
[2837.72 - 2841.72] P:1672.84 E:0.104880 |  so just seconds left now but England on the attack. Alexander Arnald on the right.
[2841.72 - 2847.72] P:1766.38 E:0.103947 |  Here is the cross right across the penalty area all the way to Trivia in the full-back position on the far side.
[2847.72 - 2852.72] P:1841.69 E:0.097069 |  Mark Gays joined the attack out there on the left, infield towards Rice.
[2852.72 - 2856.72] P:1918.42 E:0.108876 |  Now it's Denmark defending, final seconds of the first 45 minutes plus.
[2856.72 - 2862.72] P:1871.89 E:0.103880 |  Sacher now on the right-hand side, Sacher turns away from the penalty area, back into Forden on the edge of the box.
[2862.72 - 2870.72] P:1870.69 E:0.106397 |  Forden goes for the call-up but it tips over the top of the crossbar with Kasper Schmeichel standing with his hands wide apart.
[2870.72 - 2876.72] P:1867.14 E:0.109706 |  In the air, knew it was safe and there we are, one-one. That felt like Denmark's half, Matt Upsson.
[2876.72 - 2883.72] P:1902.67 E:0.107024 |  Oh absolutely, so I mean we started really well, looked in control, was passing the ball out, had a bit of structure,
[2883.72 - 2888.72] P:1864.85 E:0.108695 |  had some discipline in terms of our shape and stretching the pitch, get the goal and then honestly John,
[2888.72 - 2895.72] P:1922.82 E:0.109965 |  since that goal it's just been completely different. England have sat off, not been able to get hold of the ball.
[2895.72 - 2900.72] P:1832.74 E:0.105224 |  Denmark's reaction was absolutely brilliant and they've just completely dominated the rest of the first half.
[2900.72 - 2906.72] P:1726.61 E:0.098871 |  Yep, Mark Chapman here in Frankfurt will have many more questions for you Matt and for Conor Cody and for Izzy Christensen.
[2906.72 - 2913.72] P:1801.45 E:0.100962 |  But I think the England players body language as they left the field, I think told the story.
[2913.72 - 2917.72] P:1709.95 E:0.105059 |  They were heads down, they looked a little rattled, I have to confess.
[2917.72 - 2922.72] P:1761.62 E:0.102181 |  And at half-time, here in Frankfurt, Denmark won, England won is the score.
[2922.72 - 2929.72] P:1826.54 E:0.111124 |  You talk about body language, let's go down to Izzy Christensen pitch side because a lot of that first half,
[2929.72 - 2935.72] P:1868.68 E:0.112010 |  I was watching the midfield in particular, but there's a lot of gesturing to each other,
[2935.72 - 2940.72] P:1839.79 E:0.114067 |  there's a lot of arms outstretched, no-one wanted it here, why aren't you pressing there?
[2940.72 - 2944.72] P:1811.59 E:0.106550 |  There's a lot of frustration amongst that England team.
[2944.72 - 2951.72] P:1855.62 E:0.107714 |  Yeah, a lot of discussions happening right inside this 18-yard box, I've been behind Jordan Pickford for that first 45.
[2951.72 - 2955.72] P:1927.32 E:0.105454 |  And the communication between him, John Stones, Declan Rice getting involved,
[2955.72 - 2959.72] P:1896.51 E:0.108313 |  yeah, he's kind of kept out of it, he's been pretty away from it.
[2959.72 - 2963.72] P:1888.34 E:0.107774 |  But there's been a lot of chat, a lot of chit chat, and like you say, Chapman, some negative body language.
[2963.72 - 2969.72] P:1920.40 E:0.105930 |  But Denmark have absolutely suffocated us in the centre midfield and that is why Denmark have started to get on top of us.
[2969.72 - 2973.72] P:1882.68 E:0.106114 |  And half-time is the best thing that's probably going to happen for Gareth Southgate at the moment
[2973.72 - 2977.72] P:1867.60 E:0.108931 |  to get the opportunity to just compose the players again, have the right discussions in there
[2977.72 - 2980.72] P:1931.32 E:0.105171 |  and come out much better than they were in that first.
[2980.72 - 2987.72] P:1819.66 E:0.100183 |  And what I was going to say to you, Matt, even when we were talking about when England did have a bit of possession before the goal,
[2987.72 - 2992.72] P:1837.79 E:0.104870 |  they didn't look anywhere near as fluid and attack-minded as Denmark did when they had that.
[2992.72 - 2996.72] P:1816.34 E:0.111379 |  It's all very well-having it, but there was a lot of sideways back, sideways back.
[2996.72 - 3000.72] P:1923.32 E:0.099060 |  Denmark, at it, and their first thought is, let's break the line.
[3000.72 - 3003.72] P:1849.89 E:0.103262 |  Yeah, absolutely, and they've got somebody in there who's passing balls forward.
[3003.72 - 3006.72] P:1892.89 E:0.114631 |  They're accurate passes, they've got a runner in Hoiland,
[3006.72 - 3010.72] P:1986.62 E:0.099443 |  Mailer on the right-hand side is getting very high and wide and stretching the pitch.
[3010.72 - 3014.72] P:1899.99 E:0.099000 |  But I think there's something about what he said in terms of out-of-possession.
[3014.72 - 3019.72] P:1932.10 E:0.106025 |  You've got Ericsson dropping in there and you have to say he's doing a better job of making those overloads
[3019.72 - 3021.72] P:1875.29 E:0.101058 |  than what we do when we have the ball.
[3021.72 - 3029.72] P:1933.42 E:0.096382 |  And I think we're looking to each other to really kind of see whether or not anyone's going to go to the ball.
[3029.72 - 3033.72] P:1973.44 E:0.108053 |  I don't think we're quite clear of whose responsibility it is to go and put the press.
[3033.72 - 3036.72] P:1949.11 E:0.094022 |  We've not quite got that balance in the midfield.
[3037.72 - 3039.72] P:1972.94 E:0.119949 |  Yeah, I think I completely agree with Marta.
[3039.72 - 3043.72] P:1940.96 E:0.102253 |  What we thought Denmark was going to do was play Chris and Ericsson as a 10 on his own.
[3043.72 - 3048.72] P:1909.66 E:0.106444 |  They're kind of playing with a narrow from three, so Ericsson and Vint are both dropping kind of in a box with the midfield,
[3048.72 - 3052.72] P:1979.96 E:0.104058 |  with Hulman and Hoiberg in centre midfield.
[3052.72 - 3057.72] P:2015.14 E:0.103377 |  So they're killing us with that, so we need to try and make sure we're getting bodies up to the ball
[3057.72 - 3059.72] P:2021.96 E:0.102688 |  to be compact, to stop the ball from in between the line.
[3059.72 - 3062.72] P:1967.01 E:0.098920 |  Big Yannick Bestergaard played some lovely passes through the lines to Vint,
[3062.72 - 3065.72] P:1824.88 E:0.096875 |  and he's been on the half-ten and attacking us with one pass,
[3065.72 - 3068.72] P:1835.78 E:0.100664 |  so we've got to try and get a hold of that, but I think the best thing for us now is half-time,
[3068.72 - 3071.72] P:1939.17 E:0.099389 |  getting regroup, have a chat, see where we're going wrong,
[3071.72 - 3073.72] P:1829.02 E:0.092310 |  and come out with a different mindset at second half.
[3073.72 - 3078.72] P:1925.46 E:0.090924 |  Feels like, from what the three of you are saying here,
[3078.72 - 3082.72] P:1877.95 E:0.097610 |  Matt, that this is more a tactical thing than necessarily a...
[3082.72 - 3087.72] P:1894.45 E:0.106050 |  I know that social media is going, this player, that player, etc.
[3087.72 - 3091.72] P:1917.29 E:0.092108 |  But it's what we talked about pre-match, kind of formations here.
[3091.72 - 3094.72] P:1908.09 E:0.104255 |  If one of you gets it right, you could cause an awful lot of damage to the other one.
[3094.72 - 3097.72] P:1914.80 E:0.102020 |  Absolutely, and I think there is an overload in there.
[3097.72 - 3100.72] P:1956.89 E:0.096908 |  It's not being dealt with. It needs to be addressed, I would say,
[3100.72 - 3102.72] P:1944.07 E:0.091730 |  because there's not enough pressure on the ball.
[3102.72 - 3105.72] P:1955.87 E:0.096397 |  I mean, you can say you're going to be defensive and sit off,
[3105.72 - 3107.72] P:1988.16 E:0.105999 |  and the ball's running around the half-way line, there's no pressure,
[3107.72 - 3109.72] P:1986.79 E:0.093021 |  and that's the way you're going to play.
[3109.72 - 3112.72] P:2018.69 E:0.100643 |  But Danish players like you've just mentioned Vim, Ericsson,
[3112.72 - 3115.72] P:1926.13 E:0.100087 |  the golf scorer, Hümlen, getting on the ball,
[3115.72 - 3117.72] P:2030.28 E:0.094999 |  turning, getting his head up, having a touch,
[3117.72 - 3119.72] P:2020.43 E:0.093786 |  and all of a sudden you can have a shot, there's a pass,
[3119.72 - 3121.72] P:2012.18 E:0.103675 |  there's nobody out there applying pressure,
[3121.72 - 3122.72] P:1973.56 E:0.102537 |  and that can't be right, Conor.
[3122.72 - 3124.72] P:2013.85 E:0.107517 |  Yeah, and the thing with this sometimes, Matt,
[3124.72 - 3126.72] P:1978.51 E:0.111351 |  is that when you just said there about getting up to the ball,
[3126.72 - 3128.72] P:2048.03 E:0.101121 |  sometimes you might not be able to get up to the ball,
[3128.72 - 3130.72] P:1988.30 E:0.107830 |  someone can talk and say, right, we're staying, but you stay compact,
[3130.72 - 3133.72] P:2032.71 E:0.101304 |  you stay together, and you wait for the right times to get up to the ball.
[3133.72 - 3136.72] P:1980.75 E:0.105012 |  We're trying to get up to the ball, and we're a little bit in between at the minute.
[3136.72 - 3138.72] P:2050.48 E:0.105285 |  We're going, and we're half-and-half, and it's just opening up spaces
[3138.72 - 3139.72] P:1929.65 E:0.099628 |  for the midfield.
[3139.72 - 3141.72] P:1924.90 E:0.114722 |  But as a centre-back, you'd be screaming at your midfield players.
[3141.72 - 3142.72] P:2006.68 E:0.102417 |  100%.
[3142.72 - 3144.72] P:2021.29 E:0.105521 |  But because the best thing for you is that there is pressure on the ball,
[3144.72 - 3145.72] P:1952.98 E:0.107382 |  it allows you to do your job.
[3145.72 - 3146.72] P:1901.38 E:0.114050 |  Without a doubt, yeah.
[3146.72 - 3148.72] P:1979.63 E:0.094834 |  When there's no pressure on it, everyone's uncertain.
[3148.72 - 3150.72] P:1890.14 E:0.107515 |  Without a doubt, and as a defender as well, you want to set that pressure,
[3150.72 - 3153.72] P:1829.09 E:0.097274 |  you want to scream to Harry Kane, right, hold, and now we go.
[3153.72 - 3154.72] P:1770.15 E:0.103480 |  Yeah.
[3154.72 - 3156.72] P:1821.38 E:0.088344 |  Now's the time to go, and then you can step yourself up the pitch.
[3156.72 - 3157.72] P:2013.33 E:0.090097 |  Busy.
[3157.72 - 3160.72] P:1922.81 E:0.120163 |  Do you know what it feels like for that English midfield at the moment?
[3160.72 - 3162.72] P:1953.53 E:0.115038 |  Feels like you're in a tumble dryer.
[3162.72 - 3163.72] P:1904.05 E:0.100340 |  Yeah.
[3163.72 - 3166.72] P:1908.23 E:0.111823 |  You're getting spun around, and that is what Denmark are doing to us.
[3166.72 - 3169.72] P:1954.70 E:0.110033 |  And they need to get a grip of that quickly, and what I've noticed tactically,
[3169.72 - 3173.72] P:1918.26 E:0.111173 |  and one of the reasons why I think Denmark are on top of us at the moment,
[3173.72 - 3175.72] P:1932.25 E:0.114635 |  they're very compact centrally.
[3175.72 - 3179.72] P:1924.94 E:0.111233 |  When they win the ball back, they're switching the plate as quickly as possible,
[3179.72 - 3181.72] P:1889.67 E:0.113552 |  and it's catching England right out of shape,
[3181.72 - 3185.72] P:1978.24 E:0.106273 |  and England need to address that quickly by getting the full-backs in tighter,
[3185.72 - 3189.72] P:1955.32 E:0.105041 |  like Coworker in trippy needs to come in tighter when the ball's on the opposite side,
[3189.72 - 3192.72] P:1801.70 E:0.100194 |  because at the moment England can't deal with the switch.
[3192.72 - 3194.72] P:1711.82 E:0.123005 |  And then the other thing they have as well, Izzy,
[3194.72 - 3198.72] P:1786.37 E:0.110783 |  they do have an outball with Hoyland if he's working the channels, don't they?
[3198.72 - 3202.72] P:1941.12 E:0.105460 |  Particularly if they're not putting pressure on the ball further back in the Danish formation.
[3202.72 - 3204.72] P:1946.81 E:0.092947 |  Yeah, his attitude is exceptional.
[3204.72 - 3208.72] P:1821.15 E:0.114231 |  I've been watching him for this first 45, and he's peeling off onto John Stones,
[3208.72 - 3212.72] P:1817.45 E:0.102016 |  and he's constantly alert. Where's the space? Where is the space?
[3212.72 - 3216.72] P:1916.19 E:0.107642 |  And he's spinning him behind, because he knows in Hoibierre and Ericsson in particular,
[3216.72 - 3219.72] P:1887.87 E:0.116361 |  in the midfield for Denmark, they're going to put the ball into a space
[3219.72 - 3221.72] P:1841.17 E:0.108472 |  with a nice weight on it that he can attack the ball,
[3221.72 - 3224.72] P:1798.90 E:0.112655 |  and it's really challenging England at the back at the moment.
[3224.72 - 3227.72] P:2042.97 E:0.102405 |  It just feels like they have options.
[3227.72 - 3230.72] P:1961.88 E:0.107671 |  If they're not going to spin it in behind, they can get an out wide switch,
[3230.72 - 3233.72] P:1974.21 E:0.106838 |  as Izzy mentioned to Mele, if it doesn't go there, there's a midfield pad,
[3233.72 - 3237.72] P:2030.40 E:0.100681 |  it's found a little space. When you've got the ball as a defender for Denmark,
[3237.72 - 3240.72] P:1973.30 E:0.099096 |  it actually looks like a sweet-shot selection, isn't it, of like,
[3240.72 - 3243.72] P:1997.62 E:0.106915 |  oh, I've got a pass there, I can go wide, I can maybe go long,
[3243.72 - 3245.72] P:2046.88 E:0.101195 |  and there's options for Denmark.
[3245.72 - 3247.72] P:1995.35 E:0.099020 |  And what I will say is that's what that formation does.
[3247.72 - 3250.72] P:1942.48 E:0.109405 |  I've been lucky enough to play that formation in Wolves over the years,
[3250.72 - 3252.72] P:2001.78 E:0.098231 |  and that's what that formation does, it gives you options,
[3252.72 - 3254.72] P:2012.22 E:0.109311 |  and if you're comfortable without the ball,
[3254.72 - 3256.72] P:2012.69 E:0.097500 |  and if you're comfortable sitting in the mid-block,
[3256.72 - 3258.72] P:2023.01 E:0.108723 |  when you get the ball, there's always space to play forward.
[3258.72 - 3261.72] P:2000.47 E:0.099276 |  And this Denmark team have played this formation for years,
[3261.72 - 3264.72] P:1921.87 E:0.107751 |  so they know it inside out, and I think you can see with the first 45
[3264.72 - 3266.72] P:2008.70 E:0.083188 |  that they do know it inside out.
[3266.72 - 3268.72] P:1871.19 E:0.111607 |  I mean, the other thing at times as well,
[3268.72 - 3270.72] P:1902.81 E:0.094289 |  England played with 12, given the referee.
[3270.72 - 3272.72] P:1979.35 E:0.114950 |  He has done us the favour.
[3272.72 - 3277.72] P:1972.45 E:0.114001 |  Wow, he's made some interesting decisions on two or three occasions,
[3277.72 - 3280.72] P:1922.91 E:0.106875 |  which hasn't pleased those banks and banks of Danish fans,
[3280.72 - 3282.72] P:1973.77 E:0.102675 |  clad in red behind Izzy,
[3282.72 - 3285.72] P:1995.75 E:0.110490 |  where she is behind the goal that Jordan Pickford has been
[3285.72 - 3287.72] P:1936.87 E:0.116022 |  into that first 45 minutes.
[3287.72 - 3290.72] P:2009.73 E:0.106448 |  But despite all of that, it's Denmark wanting them,
[3290.72 - 3293.72] P:2003.59 E:0.109045 |  wanting them to have four points at the end of today
[3293.72 - 3297.72] P:2022.20 E:0.095904 |  if the score stays as is.
[3297.72 - 3300.72] P:2023.08 E:0.109365 |  But England have had fewer shots and less possessions
[3300.72 - 3303.72] P:1944.87 E:0.102134 |  than the Danes at the end of that first half.
[3303.72 - 3307.72] P:1994.52 E:0.101875 |  5-2-6 in the UK, 5-7 here in Germany.
[3307.72 - 3310.72] P:1971.30 E:0.086421 |  Nick Hatfield has a news update.

[3319.72 - 3322.72] P:1208.98 E:0.104058 |  Good evening. The BBC has learned that the party's director
[3322.72 - 3325.72] P:1380.53 E:0.107213 |  of campaigning for the Conservatives, Tony Lee,
[3325.72 - 3328.72] P:1758.99 E:0.100433 |  is being looked into by the Gambling Commission
[3328.72 - 3331.72] P:1731.72 E:0.089126 |  about alleged bets on the date of the election.
[3331.72 - 3334.72] P:1897.25 E:0.088119 |  He's married to Laura Saunders, a Conservative candidate
[3334.72 - 3336.72] P:1336.17 E:0.099264 |  who is also the subject of inquiries
[3336.72 - 3338.72] P:1439.47 E:0.116031 |  by the betting industry regulator.
[3338.72 - 3341.72] P:1783.12 E:0.094263 |  Our correspondent, Gary O'Donoughy reports.
[3341.72 - 3344.72] P:1782.32 E:0.069971 |  It is not known when the alleged bet involving Tony Lee
[3344.72 - 3347.72] P:1927.76 E:0.068491 |  and Laura Saunders was placed or how much it was for.

[3352.72 - 3357.72] P:1908.86 E:0.075073 |  is also being looked into after he placed a £100 bet,
[3357.72 - 3360.72] P:1986.43 E:0.067162 |  an action he himself apologised for
[3360.72 - 3363.72] P:2001.75 E:0.064986 |  and described as a huge error of judgement.
[3363.72 - 3366.72] P:1784.26 E:0.077704 |  Opposition figures have unsurprisingly pounced
[3366.72 - 3368.72] P:1882.59 E:0.086168 |  with the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer,

[3373.72 - 3375.72] P:1873.99 E:0.058795 |  their feet wouldn't have touched the ground.
[3375.72 - 3379.72] P:2013.35 E:0.062534 |  For the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davy described the allegations

[3384.72 - 3387.72] P:1454.55 E:0.114935 |  The Post Office has apologised for publishing the names

[3390.72 - 3393.72] P:1794.25 E:0.095249 |  prosecuted during the Horizon IT scandal.
[3393.72 - 3395.72] P:1644.10 E:0.108431 |  The company confirmed personal details were shared
[3395.72 - 3397.72] P:1761.96 E:0.078387 |  in a document on its website,
[3397.72 - 3401.72] P:1831.37 E:0.105372 |  and it has referred itself to the Information Commissioner's office.
[3401.72 - 3405.72] P:1642.54 E:0.104153 |  And the Bank of England has held interest rates at 5.25%
[3405.72 - 3407.72] P:1792.68 E:0.093629 |  for the seventh time in a row.
[3407.72 - 3409.72] P:1618.41 E:0.107993 |  The bank's Governor, Andrew Bailey, says
[3409.72 - 3412.72] P:1833.21 E:0.093874 |  it's good news inflation has returned to their target of 2%,
[3412.72 - 3416.72] P:1544.87 E:0.108348 |  but they want to make sure price rises stay low.
[3416.72 - 3418.72] P:1400.12 E:0.083552 |  The news, Ellie Brennan, has the travel.
[3418.72 - 3421.72] P:1434.53 E:0.107637 |  In the latest travel news, the M42 northbound,
[3421.72 - 3423.72] P:1397.92 E:0.104267 |  you've got stop-start traffic between Junction 3A,
[3423.72 - 3426.72] P:1386.77 E:0.111813 |  the M40 interchanged, and Junction 4.
[3426.72 - 3428.72] P:1311.20 E:0.105437 |  There was a broken down car there earlier.
[3428.72 - 3430.72] P:1581.31 E:0.107308 |  Looking very slow, though, back to Renich at Junction 3,
[3430.72 - 3432.72] P:1271.11 E:0.110682 |  and on the M40 northbound as you approach the M42,
[3432.72 - 3434.72] P:1660.38 E:0.095717 |  that's very heavily congested.
[3434.72 - 3437.72] P:1534.01 E:0.101556 |  The M1 southbound, two lanes are closed between Junction 14
[3437.72 - 3439.72] P:1475.09 E:0.099299 |  and Milton Keynes and 13.
[3439.72 - 3442.72] P:1501.94 E:0.098677 |  Emergency barrier repairs, they're really slow traffic going through.
[3442.72 - 3445.72] P:1698.71 E:0.094008 |  And in S6A12, northbound is closed.
[3445.72 - 3448.72] P:1336.52 E:0.096561 |  Between Junction 16 and 17, there's been an accident there.
[3448.72 - 3450.72] P:1573.80 E:0.089727 |  Cue in traffic on the approach to that.
[3450.72 - 3452.72] P:1348.55 E:0.092037 |  Ellie Brennan, 5-Life Travel.
[3475.72 - 3477.72] P:1597.34 E:0.120188 |  This is going to have all the festival chat, all the action,

[3489.72 - 3494.72] P:1920.75 E:0.096425 |  Denmark won, England won at the break in the other game in that group.
[3494.72 - 3498.72] P:1920.02 E:0.107218 |  Earlier on that also finished one all between Slovenia and Serbia.
[3498.72 - 3501.72] P:1953.26 E:0.102022 |  We have Italy, Spain still to come this evening.
[3501.72 - 3504.72] P:1987.86 E:0.097191 |  We'll go to our commentary team at that one shortly.
[3504.72 - 3508.72] P:1906.53 E:0.100732 |  And India or Afghanistan in the men's T20 World Cup, Fraser Mohamed.
[3508.72 - 3512.72] P:1799.14 E:0.105630 |  Well, interestingly enough, it's India in control.
[3512.72 - 3515.72] P:1651.39 E:0.098941 |  35 for three are Afghanistan after six overs.
[3515.72 - 3519.72] P:1470.79 E:0.109896 |  Struggling in pursuit of that Indian total, 181 for eight.
[3519.72 - 3521.72] P:1695.70 E:0.099595 |  Suriya Kumar Yadav with 53.
[3521.72 - 3525.72] P:1607.06 E:0.105672 |  Three wickets for Rashid Khan, three for Fazal Hakka, for Ruki.
[3525.72 - 3528.72] P:1451.01 E:0.110247 |  But Afghanistan dependent on their middle order.
[3528.72 - 3531.72] P:1702.21 E:0.085537 |  They're struggling. 35 for three after six overs.
[3531.72 - 3536.72] P:1932.21 E:0.105484 |  And then the next ball is extra if you want to listen to that big win at Queens today
[3536.72 - 3539.72] P:1965.33 E:0.092164 |  for the new British number one, Jack Draper.
[3539.72 - 3542.72] P:1892.38 E:0.100356 |  He defeated defending champion Carlos Alcaraz.
[3542.72 - 3546.72] P:1984.18 E:0.099985 |  Kiprios narrowly beat Trollerman in the gold cup at Royal Ascot.
[3546.72 - 3550.72] P:2008.02 E:0.102922 |  And after winning Olympic cycling gold in both Rio and Tokyo,
[3550.72 - 3553.72] P:2074.90 E:0.097084 |  Katie Archibald will not be in Paris.
[3553.72 - 3556.72] P:1989.24 E:0.102453 |  She fell yesterday in her garden and she no need surgery
[3556.72 - 3559.72] P:1927.92 E:0.088593 |  because she broke her ankle, her fibula,
[3559.72 - 3561.72] P:1986.52 E:0.081516 |  in that accident.
[3561.72 - 3564.72] P:1973.12 E:0.096365 |  Second half on the way from here in Frankfurt
[3564.72 - 3569.72] P:1988.97 E:0.101519 |  and then we'll be in Gelsen Kierken for Italy against Spain.
[3569.72 - 3574.72] P:1973.77 E:0.100898 |  Our commentary team of Ian Dennis and Chris Sutton are already there.
[3574.72 - 3576.72] P:2066.33 E:0.097909 |  How do you view this one, Ian?
[3576.72 - 3578.72] P:1948.71 E:0.085585 |  Looking forward to it, Mark.
[3578.72 - 3581.72] P:2018.19 E:0.099105 |  I think Spain, after the opening set of matches,
[3581.72 - 3585.72] P:1981.15 E:0.100357 |  along with Germany, we're one of the most impressive of the teams that we saw.
[3585.72 - 3588.72] P:1974.85 E:0.099851 |  So can they build on that against the defending champions?
[3588.72 - 3592.72] P:1978.38 E:0.098106 |  Obviously it's a tough group and they both know after their opening victories
[3592.72 - 3595.72] P:1977.41 E:0.102066 |  that another three points today will see them into the knockout stages.
[3595.72 - 3597.72] P:1979.83 E:0.099571 |  So I think it's going to be a really entertaining game.
[3597.72 - 3601.72] P:1967.55 E:0.097972 |  They both had their tough moments, didn't they, Chris, in their opening games?
[3601.72 - 3604.72] P:1921.71 E:0.106493 |  I mean, Spain didn't have it all their own way against Croatia
[3604.72 - 3606.72] P:1938.61 E:0.095143 |  and Italy fell behind to Albania.
[3606.72 - 3609.72] P:1743.18 E:0.105044 |  Yeah, I think there's still room for improvement
[3609.72 - 3612.72] P:1649.94 E:0.106369 |  but winning the opening games in tournament football
[3612.72 - 3614.72] P:1735.91 E:0.100154 |  is of such great importance.
[3614.72 - 3616.72] P:1700.82 E:0.101297 |  I mean, this is going to be fascinating though
[3616.72 - 3619.72] P:1803.31 E:0.113862 |  because I think going into the Euros,
[3619.72 - 3624.72] P:1994.34 E:0.096303 |  I don't think many people fancied Spain or Italy to win it
[3624.72 - 3628.72] P:2022.93 E:0.104817 |  but I still think they both showed enough in their opening games
[3628.72 - 3630.72] P:1911.91 E:0.108848 |  to know that they can improve
[3630.72 - 3634.72] P:1949.49 E:0.108897 |  and that Ian's quite rightly touched on the importance of winning this game
[3634.72 - 3636.72] P:1989.67 E:0.099912 |  to go through to the knockouts.
[3636.72 - 3637.72] P:1938.89 E:0.095858 |  That's massive.
[3637.72 - 3644.72] P:1954.64 E:0.098845 |  But it wouldn't surprise me if we saw Spain or Italy actually winning the Euros.
[3644.72 - 3649.72] P:1983.62 E:0.102971 |  They both teams have great quality and interesting managers.
[3649.72 - 3652.72] P:2035.02 E:0.093604 |  What do you mean by interesting managers?
[3652.72 - 3655.72] P:1923.89 E:0.111591 |  Well, I mean, they're similar positions
[3655.72 - 3658.72] P:1911.03 E:0.104965 |  but I think they're both teams in transition.
[3658.72 - 3662.72] P:1921.21 E:0.100272 |  De La Fuente in truth, I hadn't heard a lot about him.
[3662.72 - 3667.72] P:1970.41 E:0.106228 |  I know that he took the Spanish junior teams and had great success there
[3667.72 - 3672.72] P:1963.85 E:0.099929 |  so getting the full Spanish job,
[3672.72 - 3675.72] P:1877.92 E:0.098880 |  that's a great faith from the Spanish FA
[3675.72 - 3679.72] P:1794.66 E:0.104752 |  but they looked pretty handy against Croatia and Spalletti.
[3679.72 - 3685.72] P:1847.44 E:0.103687 |  I think did James Horncastle not say that he's the best manager in the tournament.
[3685.72 - 3689.72] P:1911.71 E:0.109027 |  We know he likes to play front football all about performance.
[3689.72 - 3690.72] P:1811.98 E:0.107829 |  He was disappointed.
[3690.72 - 3693.72] P:1824.83 E:0.108607 |  He came out and said he was disappointed with the performance in the first game.
[3693.72 - 3698.72] P:1880.40 E:0.104085 |  Albeit, we saw Albania and they ran Italy close
[3698.72 - 3700.72] P:1842.77 E:0.113676 |  and we saw what they did to Croatia yesterday.
[3700.72 - 3702.72] P:1889.94 E:0.107277 |  This is the group of death.
[3702.72 - 3704.72] P:1928.11 E:0.109336 |  I thought this was always going to be the Titus group
[3704.72 - 3709.72] P:1972.02 E:0.106786 |  but tonight is going to be enormous in terms of whoever wins is already through.
[3709.72 - 3710.72] P:1646.47 E:0.137109 |  Whoever loses though.
[3710.72 - 3714.72] P:1966.00 E:0.108994 |  You wouldn't have expected Croatia to be on one point after two games though, would you?
[3714.72 - 3716.72] P:1928.55 E:0.111813 |  Well, I wrote them off at the start of the tournament.
[3716.72 - 3717.72] P:1985.39 E:0.113340 |  I would have done.
[3719.72 - 3725.72] P:1947.29 E:0.107366 |  Speaking of your predictions, can I just say what a joy it was to read your prediction
[3725.72 - 3731.72] P:1911.18 E:0.106206 |  for the France-Nedalins game that's coming up tomorrow on the BBC Sport website.
[3731.72 - 3734.72] P:1920.58 E:0.109768 |  I wouldn't normally point people in the direction of your predictions
[3734.72 - 3739.72] P:1866.08 E:0.104277 |  but if you've got 30 seconds a minute to read Chris's view,
[3739.72 - 3743.72] P:1928.17 E:0.096972 |  Dr Chris's view on Kylian Mbappe's broken nose
[3743.72 - 3747.72] P:1869.13 E:0.110473 |  and how that might affect the French, it is well worth reading on the BBC Sport website.
[3747.72 - 3752.72] P:1963.87 E:0.102911 |  Can I also just quickly say, Mark, can I also say that isn't a great read
[3752.72 - 3757.72] P:1965.36 E:0.105596 |  but you're lucky we're here tonight because we couldn't get out of the hotel car park.
[3757.72 - 3763.72] P:1994.48 E:0.101514 |  Why Rob and Ian Dennis couldn't get out for 15-20 minutes.
[3763.72 - 3766.72] P:1878.79 E:0.118181 |  It's Rob's first tournament, you can't throw away those barriers.
[3766.72 - 3769.72] P:1847.31 E:0.108914 |  Honestly, I've videoed it all on my Maype Dons socials.
[3769.72 - 3771.72] P:1797.44 E:0.115168 |  Can you know what though, Mark?
[3771.72 - 3777.72] P:2025.13 E:0.096688 |  I said to Chris, I said, we'll meet in the garage, the car park at five o'clock.
[3777.72 - 3778.72] P:1949.27 E:0.114531 |  He was wasting in reception.
[3778.72 - 3781.72] P:2037.53 E:0.110588 |  Me and Rob are on time in the right place, right?
[3781.72 - 3785.72] P:2028.07 E:0.114700 |  It's always a vicious fault. This is now called a deflection technique.
[3785.72 - 3787.72] P:1948.06 E:0.115838 |  It's a great watch, I'll send it to you later.
[3787.72 - 3792.72] P:1968.37 E:0.110262 |  OK, could be a long night listening to his silly spade on Five Life but they are...
[3792.72 - 3794.72] P:1972.94 E:0.081312 |  Tomorrow's the longest day.
[3794.72 - 3795.72] P:1934.67 E:0.121718 |  Yes, very good.
[3795.72 - 3797.72] P:1873.58 E:0.109678 |  Tonight's the longest night.
[3797.72 - 3803.72] P:1898.95 E:0.106696 |  It is in Gelsenkirk and we will be with those two a little bit later on.
[3803.72 - 3808.72] P:1895.54 E:0.108932 |  England and Denmark both back out and there are no changes, John Murray.
[3808.72 - 3812.72] P:1908.88 E:0.105951 |  For either side, but you did wonder whether there might be tweaks for England.
[3812.72 - 3817.72] P:1983.29 E:0.093379 |  You did, and I can tell you it's a very tight car park that we've got in Essen.
[3817.72 - 3820.72] P:2001.31 E:0.091213 |  So I'm with Ian and Rob.
[3820.72 - 3824.72] P:1919.57 E:0.095148 |  Right, Denmark were out for the start of the second half as they looked like
[3824.72 - 3826.72] P:1907.75 E:0.080072 |  they couldn't wait to get going.
[3826.72 - 3827.72] P:1898.75 E:0.077161 |  No changes.
[3827.72 - 3831.72] P:1802.87 E:0.095693 |  England were late out of the dressing room or longer out of the dressing room
[3831.72 - 3835.72] P:1866.88 E:0.098536 |  as though they were a little bit trepidatious about what might lie ahead.
[3835.72 - 3837.72] P:1737.54 E:0.091341 |  So the teams are the same.
[3837.72 - 3840.72] P:1791.48 E:0.093067 |  Schmeichel and Gull for Denmark, Joachim Andersen, Andreas Christensen,
[3840.72 - 3843.72] P:1713.65 E:0.098796 |  Janak Vestigard, there's the whistle for the start of the second half.
[3843.72 - 3845.72] P:1638.02 E:0.108582 |  Mailer on the right had so much space and time.
[3845.72 - 3849.72] P:1524.01 E:0.107757 |  Mailer, Victor Christensen on the left who was caught out for the England opening goal.
[3849.72 - 3853.72] P:1510.09 E:0.109083 |  Hulnand and Hoibjeer in the middle and then as Conor Cody's been describing,
[3853.72 - 3859.72] P:1516.00 E:0.107605 |  Ericsson and Vint with Hoiland in a sort of spearhead as an offside flag goes up against the Danes.
[3859.72 - 3862.72] P:1652.95 E:0.106753 |  And England, we did wonder whether Garis Southgate might do something.
[3862.72 - 3866.72] P:1684.75 E:0.101195 |  Pickford in goal, Walker Stones, Gay in trippier, Alexander-Arnold and Rice,
[3866.72 - 3871.72] P:1668.98 E:0.103194 |  Saka Bellingham-Fordon and Harry Kane, the England goal scorer through the middle.
[3871.72 - 3876.72] P:1727.14 E:0.097484 |  We thought, would he bring perhaps Gallagher, Menu, but he's sticking with Trent Alexander-Arnold.
[3876.72 - 3882.72] P:1827.47 E:0.091068 |  They're back out after half time, very similar shape, similar personnel.
[3882.72 - 3886.72] P:1845.59 E:0.099553 |  Rice, a little bit more central, Alexander-Arnold and Joop Bellingham.
[3887.72 - 3892.72] P:1786.64 E:0.111751 |  Interesting how they get to grips with that so important middle of the pitch in this second half.
[3892.72 - 3895.72] P:1686.24 E:0.100045 |  It really is going to be key to the outcome.
[3895.72 - 3902.72] P:1700.16 E:0.097845 |  Second group match this, Denmark-1, England-1, but this feels like a massive half for England that lies ahead here.
[3902.72 - 3907.72] P:1603.36 E:0.104423 |  They are top of the group with three points, Slovenia-1 on two, Denmark and Serbia on one.
[3907.72 - 3911.72] P:1603.11 E:0.094801 |  But Denmark have dominated this since England took the lead strangely.
[3911.72 - 3914.72] P:1796.84 E:0.100881 |  And here they come again on the right-hand side.
[3914.72 - 3919.72] P:1779.01 E:0.104442 |  Mailer's ball into the penalty area, still Denmark left-foot shot, that's deflected across the goal,
[3919.72 - 3923.72] P:1848.46 E:0.103449 |  Highlands after it, Stones heads it away, and England have just about dealt with,
[3923.72 - 3927.72] P:1849.32 E:0.104801 |  in fact, been kicked up in the air by Trippier and caught by Pickford.
[3927.72 - 3934.72] P:1919.46 E:0.103107 |  That does not bring confidence to all of the England fans around this stadium.
[3934.72 - 3937.72] P:1746.81 E:0.103177 |  Well, Vint picks up an unbelievable position to get on the ball.
[3937.72 - 3943.72] P:1875.44 E:0.113028 |  Alexander-Arnold is very fortunate, I think, to get a foul from the referee, Hoibier.
[3943.72 - 3945.72] P:1741.49 E:0.096832 |  I thought he'd given it away.
[3945.72 - 3949.72] P:1830.70 E:0.097650 |  I don't think he had too much of a picture when he received the ball from Pickford on his back foot.
[3949.72 - 3953.72] P:1767.68 E:0.102013 |  There's not really much of an idea about where that ball was going and nearly got robbed.
[3953.72 - 3957.72] P:1833.31 E:0.094769 |  I'm not even sure if that was a foul, John, to be honest, but the chance before,
[3957.72 - 3961.72] P:1781.56 E:0.092537 |  it was Vint who just peeled off into that area, whether it's Ericsson.
[3961.72 - 3965.72] P:1816.30 E:0.106099 |  You know that Hoibier is going to be the one stretching, but Vint is a problem.
[3965.72 - 3969.72] P:1801.77 E:0.101933 |  He just keeps picking up lovely little positions, making himself available,
[3969.72 - 3972.72] P:1746.76 E:0.096085 |  and they're just feeding the ball into him, and then he can get his head up and play.
[3972.72 - 3975.72] P:1607.63 E:0.101250 |  Matt Upps and England World Cup player Conor Cody is up here as well,
[3975.72 - 3979.72] P:1733.97 E:0.108344 |  who's been in Gareth Southgate's last two squads at the Euros in the World Cup,
[3979.72 - 3984.72] P:1757.42 E:0.102005 |  and Declan Rice is surrounded by red Danish shirts and loses possession,
[3984.72 - 3986.72] P:1704.04 E:0.098292 |  and the Danes have got it again.
[3986.72 - 3989.72] P:1786.14 E:0.106068 |  And I must say, we talked in the first half, at the end of the first half,
[3989.72 - 3993.72] P:1652.06 E:0.097740 |  about how important it was for Gareth Southgate to get them in and regroup.
[3993.72 - 3997.72] P:1647.64 E:0.101950 |  The opening moments of the second half are not promising for England,
[3997.72 - 4002.72] P:1764.61 E:0.107762 |  although Gaine steps forward, and now Kane, under pressure from Andreas Christensen,
[4002.72 - 4004.72] P:1664.63 E:0.105828 |  is able to find Saka on the right-hand side.
[4004.72 - 4007.72] P:1682.98 E:0.099290 |  Ball fortunately deflects to Walker, could have gone anywhere.
[4007.72 - 4010.72] P:1588.34 E:0.101891 |  Back to Kane, England approaching the edge of the penalty area.
[4010.72 - 4013.72] P:1645.63 E:0.104069 |  Here is Saka, little ball to Harry Kane on the right-hand side.
[4013.72 - 4016.72] P:1835.92 E:0.111265 |  Kane, who scored his 64th England goal in the first half.
[4016.72 - 4023.72] P:1871.58 E:0.110059 |  Then back to the halfway line, and England go back into the centre circle.
[4023.72 - 4028.72] P:1808.72 E:0.103385 |  They're attacking now towards the stand that is absolutely packed.
[4028.72 - 4031.72] P:1714.63 E:0.105303 |  It's splashed with red, and a little bit of white in there as well.
[4031.72 - 4034.72] P:1657.62 E:0.094688 |  The Denmark end, 16,000 supporters.
[4034.72 - 4036.72] P:1687.80 E:0.103795 |  John Stones now to Kyle Walker.
[4036.72 - 4038.72] P:1632.87 E:0.098007 |  Then back centrally to Trent Alexander-Arnold.
[4038.72 - 4041.72] P:1556.78 E:0.110991 |  Rice has a look over his shoulder, gives it back to the Liverpool man,
[4041.72 - 4045.72] P:1570.89 E:0.108710 |  he's given it away, misplaced pass that John Stones is able to come across,
[4045.72 - 4047.72] P:1750.54 E:0.109150 |  and just sends a pass out to the left-hand side.
[4047.72 - 4050.72] P:1789.67 E:0.108028 |  She has from Denmark because that was going nowhere.
[4050.72 - 4052.72] P:1679.73 E:0.104841 |  That just landed the ball in no man's land,
[4052.72 - 4054.72] P:1651.66 E:0.095909 |  and Denmark were able to take possession.
[4054.72 - 4058.72] P:1476.39 E:0.092341 |  And England are here in Frankfurt.
[4058.72 - 4061.72] P:1544.30 E:0.107059 |  They look as though they're on the verge of a crisis.
[4061.72 - 4063.72] P:1486.14 E:0.100600 |  Just disjointed, isn't it?
[4063.72 - 4069.72] P:1615.90 E:0.098477 |  Not coming together at all in terms of being fluid in or out of possession.
[4069.72 - 4073.72] P:1627.44 E:0.095287 |  Header forward, Andreas Christensen wins it against Bellingham.
[4073.72 - 4076.72] P:1463.37 E:0.106642 |  Bellingham in on the challenge to win it back.
[4076.72 - 4079.72] P:1676.75 E:0.104342 |  Christian Erikson's in there as well.
[4079.72 - 4084.72] P:1773.05 E:0.097944 |  And then up to Hojland, Vint, first-time pass is actually behind Victor Christensen,
[4084.72 - 4089.72] P:1681.41 E:0.100506 |  who with Bellingham still taking time to get up, looks at the referee,
[4089.72 - 4093.72] P:1759.83 E:0.103600 |  and walks away, clearly feels that he should have been given a free kick,
[4093.72 - 4094.72] P:1618.47 E:0.100247 |  which he wasn't.
[4094.72 - 4097.72] P:1706.71 E:0.095680 |  So Denmark will come for it again.
[4097.72 - 4101.72] P:1582.19 E:0.092346 |  Mela, and then Mela back into his own half.
[4101.72 - 4105.72] P:1646.36 E:0.100442 |  Mela the Wolfsdurg man who came in, that was the only change that Casper Hulman,
[4105.72 - 4107.72] P:1675.85 E:0.104561 |  the likable coach of Denmark.
[4107.72 - 4110.72] P:1575.39 E:0.101290 |  This is his third tournament, Carousel gets fourth.
[4110.72 - 4114.72] P:1582.80 E:0.097999 |  Casper Hulman just making that one change today.
[4114.72 - 4117.72] P:1439.64 E:0.115314 |  Denmark with it in the centre-circle.
[4117.72 - 4119.72] P:1524.21 E:0.105618 |  1-1 in the earlier match in this group.
[4119.72 - 4124.72] P:1472.86 E:0.108023 |  Long and forward towards Hojland, who chests it off,
[4124.72 - 4127.72] P:1550.83 E:0.110984 |  played forward by Christian Erikson, and then Gage is able to clear the fold
[4127.72 - 4130.72] P:1494.90 E:0.104318 |  and jumping forward, just heads it back to Denmark,
[4130.72 - 4132.72] P:1497.51 E:0.109694 |  and then in goes Reiss to try and win it back.
[4132.72 - 4136.72] P:1676.34 E:0.115265 |  Awkward bouncing ball for Bellingham, and then Alexander-Arnold sets off
[4136.72 - 4140.72] P:1757.98 E:0.108667 |  from inside his own half with a run, passes the ball behind Foden,
[4140.72 - 4142.72] P:1722.24 E:0.099187 |  he had Kane, Foden and Sacher ahead of him.
[4142.72 - 4146.72] P:1715.97 E:0.100872 |  That was a welcome sight for England to see Alexander-Arnold taking charge
[4146.72 - 4149.72] P:1763.38 E:0.105322 |  of the situation, and England pouring forward.
[4149.72 - 4152.72] P:1859.72 E:0.100115 |  It's been far too little of that from the team.
[4152.72 - 4154.72] P:1885.85 E:0.108818 |  Walker, now to Sacher on the right-hand side,
[4154.72 - 4157.72] P:1835.90 E:0.112731 |  Sacher up against Victor Christensen, looking to take him on.
[4157.72 - 4160.72] P:1833.03 E:0.099427 |  Victor Christensen, backpedalite, then the cross to the back post,
[4160.72 - 4163.72] P:1796.49 E:0.103020 |  taken down by Foden, who stabs it, it's actually cleared away,
[4163.72 - 4168.72] P:1706.96 E:0.105548 |  just touched away by Neyla, but England now are actually taking a bit of initiative here.
[4168.72 - 4171.72] P:1697.86 E:0.102492 |  Trivia into the penalty area, Bellingham strides after it,
[4171.72 - 4175.72] P:1796.64 E:0.101438 |  languidly, this tall 20-year-old, keeping possession,
[4175.72 - 4178.72] P:1724.81 E:0.101561 |  then giving it back to Kieran Trivia on the left-hand side.
[4178.72 - 4181.72] P:1871.00 E:0.108254 |  Trivia back to Reiss, thinks about a shot, does have a low shot,
[4181.72 - 4184.72] P:1812.13 E:0.102744 |  which is deflected, but I think it took a bit of the pace off it, it was spinning,
[4184.72 - 4187.72] P:1865.07 E:0.102378 |  but Schmeichel could just drop to his left and hold it.
[4187.72 - 4190.72] P:1721.13 E:0.109776 |  There was one or two little nicks on the way through this ball,
[4190.72 - 4193.72] P:1715.75 E:0.105472 |  I think a lot of the pace was taken right off it from Hoiland,
[4193.72 - 4196.72] P:1756.26 E:0.096297 |  who does a good job getting back to Schmeichel, Reiss down,
[4196.72 - 4202.72] P:1628.65 E:0.098317 |  and it just skips on through to Kaspersh-Meichel, who just gathers it up rather easily.
[4203.72 - 4206.72] P:1426.30 E:0.104467 |  There's got to be a nervous watch for England supporters.
[4206.72 - 4212.72] P:1560.24 E:0.094781 |  One-one the score, but Denmark have given more than as good as they've got
[4212.72 - 4216.72] P:1491.02 E:0.107719 |  from England in this match, very disjointed from the England team,
[4216.72 - 4219.72] P:1650.01 E:0.115997 |  there must be substitutions on the way, you would think.
[4219.72 - 4221.72] P:1781.42 E:0.114692 |  That's a poor pass forward though from Sennethield,
[4221.72 - 4225.72] P:1687.38 E:0.110222 |  from the Danish goal scorer, Hoiland, that just gives possession back to England.
[4225.72 - 4229.72] P:1701.80 E:0.109798 |  The roof is closed, we've got this canopy-style roof to this stadium,
[4229.72 - 4234.72] P:1618.87 E:0.102890 |  which is out to the south of the city, just under 50,000 people inside,
[4234.72 - 4237.72] P:1537.49 E:0.107612 |  and actually there's a big gap between the top of the stands and that roof,
[4237.72 - 4240.72] P:1817.53 E:0.103478 |  so the sun is shining in it, streaked across the pitch.
[4240.72 - 4244.72] P:1774.62 E:0.099830 |  As England with John Stones just wander forward with the ball,
[4244.72 - 4248.72] P:1854.24 E:0.103411 |  Stones then in field to Alexander-Arnold,
[4248.72 - 4252.72] P:1751.62 E:0.113735 |  White shirt just bobbing outside his blue shorts,
[4252.72 - 4256.72] P:1725.13 E:0.104494 |  Trippier, 50th cap for Kieran Trippier, the Newcastle United man.
[4256.72 - 4258.72] P:1704.75 E:0.117149 |  Alexander-Arnold goes for a long high pass,
[4258.72 - 4260.72] P:1731.12 E:0.109697 |  Sacher into the penalty area tries to pull it down,
[4260.72 - 4263.72] P:1715.25 E:0.114060 |  but then as Schmeichel comes out, the defenders in there as well,
[4263.72 - 4266.72] P:1755.48 E:0.110430 |  Sacher actually just knotted forward through for a goal kick.
[4269.72 - 4272.72] P:1723.89 E:0.111040 |  England are going to make a change, and it is Conagallagher.
[4272.72 - 4275.72] P:1643.48 E:0.108555 |  Yeah, as you called John, to be honest, got a spot on,
[4275.72 - 4279.72] P:1696.23 E:0.106621 |  and I think Conagallagher, obviously the player coming on to affect the game
[4279.72 - 4283.72] P:1640.89 E:0.105264 |  when England were suffering a little bit against Serbia,
[4283.72 - 4287.72] P:1559.66 E:0.110567 |  who's the man who's just taken his jumper off
[4287.72 - 4290.72] P:1592.99 E:0.107697 |  and is getting some instruction in the technical area.
[4290.72 - 4293.72] P:1535.49 E:0.114399 |  Let's bring in Conagallagher, Conacordi as well.
[4293.72 - 4295.72] P:1562.46 E:0.103064 |  It had to come.
[4295.72 - 4298.72] P:1649.67 E:0.121528 |  Say what, John, if you do some job, if he was up here and down there...
[4298.72 - 4301.72] P:1856.28 E:0.109367 |  That would be more than box-to-box.
[4301.72 - 4304.72] P:1842.58 E:0.103933 |  Box-to-commentary box with Schmielder.
[4304.72 - 4306.72] P:1542.08 E:0.101223 |  No, I think it's a good call.
[4306.72 - 4309.72] P:1609.61 E:0.109400 |  We mentioned it half-time, didn't we, about the legs that Conor will give,
[4309.72 - 4310.72] P:1391.83 E:0.098740 |  and it'll come in.
[4310.72 - 4312.72] P:1541.03 E:0.115673 |  And there'll be a little bit of agency.
[4312.72 - 4314.72] P:1574.07 E:0.107502 |  I think that's the biggest thing at this moment in time.
[4314.72 - 4316.72] P:1730.30 E:0.113357 |  There's a real lack of agency with England,
[4316.72 - 4318.72] P:1700.80 E:0.109879 |  I don't know if it's tired legs or a little bit of fadgy,
[4318.72 - 4320.72] P:1628.83 E:0.102697 |  but we just need a little bit of agency in there.
[4320.72 - 4324.72] P:1677.00 E:0.112820 |  Yeah, I think Conagallagher is waiting to come on as Miele hits the pass forward,
[4324.72 - 4327.72] P:1654.14 E:0.099548 |  that Gazehead will head it down, Ericsson on the stretch,
[4327.72 - 4330.72] P:1526.10 E:0.108387 |  then in field, it'll glance him, head a forward Schumann,
[4330.72 - 4333.72] P:1812.64 E:0.110936 |  Hulmann, but Hulmann was coming back from an offside position.
[4333.72 - 4336.72] P:1691.21 E:0.111093 |  And actually, again, the referee could have allowed play to continue there
[4336.72 - 4339.72] P:1715.64 E:0.103243 |  with England on the attack, but he's actually stopped play
[4339.72 - 4342.72] P:1754.42 E:0.104048 |  so that the change can be made, and it is Trent Alexander-Arnold
[4342.72 - 4344.72] P:1743.38 E:0.114382 |  who will be replaced by Conagallagher,
[4344.72 - 4348.72] P:1859.53 E:0.112836 |  who, as in the match against Serbia, comes on as a substitute, the Chelsea man.
[4348.72 - 4351.72] P:1925.19 E:0.118030 |  Yeah, I think it was interesting we were talking before about
[4351.72 - 4354.72] P:1974.80 E:0.117663 |  being not in the start of 11 and having an impact
[4354.72 - 4358.72] P:1911.36 E:0.118561 |  and kind of playing or earning your way into the team.
[4358.72 - 4361.72] P:1855.45 E:0.104927 |  It's a great opportunity for Conagallagher to come on
[4361.72 - 4364.72] P:1762.72 E:0.107986 |  and have a positive impact with his energy.
[4364.72 - 4367.72] P:1745.09 E:0.103304 |  Con has just spoken about needing that in the middle of the park.
[4367.72 - 4369.72] P:1688.44 E:0.106867 |  Well, that's what he brings. He'll run all day,
[4369.72 - 4371.72] P:1861.33 E:0.105253 |  and he'll just get after the ball, any loose balls,
[4371.72 - 4374.72] P:1812.52 E:0.093370 |  anything that drops down, applying pressure.
[4374.72 - 4376.72] P:1700.21 E:0.088731 |  So a big opportunity for him in this game,
[4376.72 - 4379.72] P:1709.99 E:0.095762 |  which is looking like it is slightly slipping away from England.
[4379.72 - 4381.72] P:1545.12 E:0.104187 |  It does have that feel.
[4381.72 - 4385.72] P:1877.09 E:0.094819 |  So Conagallagher coming on in the 54th minute,
[4385.72 - 4388.72] P:1724.87 E:0.097977 |  and Trent Alexander-Arnold is off.
[4388.72 - 4393.72] P:1825.82 E:0.098267 |  And England in possession of the ball, playing it back to Pickford,
[4393.72 - 4397.72] P:1757.47 E:0.102097 |  controls it, and then left-footed to the halfway line.
[4397.72 - 4400.72] P:1637.35 E:0.097846 |  Andres Christensen with the challenge, but Kane saw him coming.
[4400.72 - 4402.72] P:1555.00 E:0.115873 |  It was the England captain who got his head to the ball,
[4402.72 - 4405.72] P:1790.74 E:0.117345 |  and now Bellingham gets the ball down and is off on a run
[4405.72 - 4409.72] P:1805.92 E:0.098779 |  and passes it to Foden, slightly behind Phil Foden, back into the area.
[4409.72 - 4411.72] P:1750.29 E:0.109334 |  Again, Bellingham's low ball across the penalty area,
[4411.72 - 4415.72] P:1886.87 E:0.119430 |  but that is whacked away by Hulman, landed on his feet,
[4415.72 - 4418.72] P:1855.62 E:0.113238 |  and he gave it what for and put it out for a throw.
[4418.72 - 4422.72] P:1864.00 E:0.110472 |  Conagallagher turns away, because I think he's thought about
[4422.72 - 4425.72] P:1825.47 E:0.108024 |  making the run across the park exactly where that ball came in for Bellingham,
[4425.72 - 4427.72] P:1739.62 E:0.107117 |  but he decided to hold the edge of the box,
[4427.72 - 4429.72] P:1738.62 E:0.096738 |  and it was cleared easily,
[4429.72 - 4432.72] P:1780.48 E:0.098195 |  but any kind of run across the face would have been an opportunity.
[4432.72 - 4436.72] P:1759.24 E:0.098060 |  And actually Denmark are going to make a double change just shortly.
[4436.72 - 4438.72] P:1741.79 E:0.094302 |  I see Michael Damsegaard is going to come on.
[4438.72 - 4441.72] P:1764.20 E:0.102875 |  Remember, he scored the free kick against England at Wembley
[4441.72 - 4444.72] P:1761.79 E:0.107331 |  in the semifinal three years ago, so he's coming on,
[4444.72 - 4446.72] P:1708.15 E:0.114299 |  and also Alexander Barr,
[4446.72 - 4449.72] P:1701.79 E:0.101752 |  so I guess he'll be coming on for Mellor on the right-hand side.
[4449.72 - 4452.72] P:1732.79 E:0.094328 |  So a double change coming for Denmark.
[4452.72 - 4456.72] P:1779.36 E:0.098266 |  Here is Conagallagher, long blonde-haired tie-back.
[4456.72 - 4460.72] P:1690.29 E:0.102981 |  Now to Saka on the right-hand side, Saka taking on Victor Christensen,
[4460.72 - 4463.72] P:1782.39 E:0.115722 |  and then playing it in field of Foden on his left foot, shoots low,
[4463.72 - 4464.72] P:2064.73 E:0.122256 |  and it's the post!
[4464.72 - 4467.72] P:1854.42 E:0.107876 |  It comes out to Saka, but Saka was under pressure from Victor Christensen,
[4467.72 - 4471.72] P:1861.46 E:0.107766 |  who, no, his final touch was off, Saka, it is a goal kick,
[4471.72 - 4473.72] P:1878.75 E:0.108017 |  but England now hit the post.
[4473.72 - 4476.72] P:1761.83 E:0.100912 |  Yeah, bit of snap in the play in his second half.
[4476.72 - 4478.72] P:1667.19 E:0.112312 |  Saka doing his thing, luring the defenders in,
[4478.72 - 4482.72] P:1711.73 E:0.104787 |  sees the open space to slide the ball in field to Foden,
[4482.72 - 4485.72] P:1818.90 E:0.102887 |  who's come all the way across, one touch to control,
[4485.72 - 4487.72] P:1760.18 E:0.105881 |  another one to get out of his feet,
[4487.72 - 4490.72] P:1745.41 E:0.112470 |  and he drives it towards the near post, really low along the ground,
[4490.72 - 4494.72] P:1725.50 E:0.098477 |  and it's ricochets off the upright, straight back out into play.
[4494.72 - 4498.72] P:1701.42 E:0.107419 |  England midfield at Izzy Christensen's down behind that goal.
[4498.72 - 4501.72] P:1819.12 E:0.112182 |  Yeah, it's a brilliant bit of play from Saka, isn't it?
[4501.72 - 4505.72] P:1776.33 E:0.109983 |  Cuts inside and he finds Foden, and it's a daisy cutter
[4505.72 - 4507.72] P:1903.78 E:0.107486 |  across the surface of the grass by Foden,
[4507.72 - 4509.72] P:1744.85 E:0.109927 |  it fizzes away from the post.
[4509.72 - 4511.72] P:1883.28 E:0.125376 |  Kasper Schermakl is actually really lucky,
[4511.72 - 4514.72] P:1813.34 E:0.113973 |  it doesn't come back off the post and hits him and ricochet into his own net,
[4514.72 - 4516.72] P:1966.72 E:0.104077 |  but there's a bit of an angle on the ball,
[4516.72 - 4519.72] P:1952.81 E:0.110165 |  but brilliant from Foden, and that's more like it from him.
[4520.72 - 4525.72] P:1850.49 E:0.115833 |  It will change, it's Vint and Victor Christensen who have come off.
[4525.72 - 4528.72] P:1794.89 E:0.102354 |  So the Brentford man, Mikael Damsegaard,
[4528.72 - 4536.72] P:1792.16 E:0.102443 |  coming on into the midfield, a forward-thinking player,
[4536.72 - 4544.72] P:1892.83 E:0.110994 |  and then Alexander Bar, who started the first match for Denmark against Slovenia.
[4544.72 - 4549.72] P:1675.53 E:0.109742 |  Alexander Bar has come on to play on the right-hand side.
[4549.72 - 4553.72] P:1649.39 E:0.106390 |  Yeah, he switched with Mairla's gone up there to the far side.
[4553.72 - 4555.72] P:1451.10 E:0.115062 |  So the double change from Kasper Schermakl.
[4555.72 - 4560.72] P:1509.26 E:0.109170 |  The score remains 1-1, the ball out of play for a throw-in to England.
[4560.72 - 4565.72] P:1589.16 E:0.115304 |  So 1-1, it's on BBC One as well, the Euros all across the BBC,
[4565.72 - 4569.72] P:1577.45 E:0.111182 |  all the platforms, the match commentaries at the heart of what we do,
[4569.72 - 4571.72] P:1628.95 E:0.123917 |  where you can rewind the live radio,
[4571.72 - 4574.72] P:1581.75 E:0.112389 |  not necessarily sure this is one that you will want to listen back to,
[4574.72 - 4575.72] P:1528.65 E:0.114205 |  but we'll see.
[4575.72 - 4578.72] P:1541.18 E:0.111264 |  But all the podcasts are on there as well, the football daily.
[4578.72 - 4581.72] P:1584.05 E:0.107930 |  You'll never beat Kyle Walker.
[4581.72 - 4584.72] P:1635.67 E:0.113401 |  That's going to tempt fate, but that's all on there.
[4584.72 - 4586.72] P:1588.17 E:0.107585 |  Denmark, one England, one.
[4586.72 - 4588.72] P:1662.73 E:0.112469 |  And you can listen to the five-life commentary, by the way,
[4588.72 - 4592.72] P:1631.03 E:0.105706 |  with the BBC TV pictures, if you go to the iPlayer BBC Sport website,
[4592.72 - 4594.72] P:1538.41 E:0.101316 |  and app, it's all synced up.
[4594.72 - 4597.72] P:1614.21 E:0.105105 |  1-1 with Denmark playing the ball forward down the right-hand side.
[4597.72 - 4599.72] P:1727.79 E:0.103991 |  This is for the newly arrived Damsegaard,
[4599.72 - 4601.72] P:1658.18 E:0.113496 |  who gets the ball into the penalty area.
[4601.72 - 4603.72] P:1818.61 E:0.104206 |  It bounces almost to Christian Eriksson,
[4603.72 - 4607.72] P:1899.09 E:0.104196 |  and Conor Gallagher just got there in the nick of time inside the area
[4607.72 - 4609.72] P:1820.51 E:0.111362 |  to prevent it from doing so. It's out for a throw.
[4609.72 - 4611.72] P:1849.76 E:0.097598 |  That's a crucial touch. Hoiland does brilliantly.
[4611.72 - 4613.72] P:1688.13 E:0.108543 |  The ball gets looped over.
[4613.72 - 4614.72] P:1802.52 E:0.111462 |  He doesn't try and do anything.
[4614.72 - 4617.72] P:1763.71 E:0.107550 |  He just gets his body across and just chests it into the space.
[4617.72 - 4619.72] P:1650.47 E:0.104094 |  He knows that a midfield player could be arriving.
[4619.72 - 4622.72] P:1675.29 E:0.109182 |  Throw-in from Barthes, a long one into the penalty area,
[4622.72 - 4626.72] P:1590.73 E:0.102958 |  headed down and then cleared away by Saka on the edge of the box.
[4626.72 - 4631.72] P:1598.71 E:0.107253 |  There's Joachim Andersen, who's put under pressure,
[4631.72 - 4633.72] P:1644.36 E:0.101934 |  and Harry Kane now.
[4633.72 - 4636.72] P:1796.01 E:0.123033 |  Harry Kane goes for a curling pass, and what a lovely pass that is.
[4636.72 - 4639.72] P:1756.78 E:0.113414 |  Beautifully waited for Saka, Saka now near the edge of the box.
[4639.72 - 4641.72] P:1740.73 E:0.109420 |  Two Danish players with him.
[4641.72 - 4643.72] P:1747.25 E:0.111110 |  Saka then turns and shoots across the face of goal,
[4643.72 - 4647.72] P:1886.28 E:0.110444 |  but wide at the far post, but Harry Kane started that.
[4647.72 - 4650.72] P:1746.38 E:0.102235 |  Better. I don't mind that kind of positivity.
[4650.72 - 4653.72] P:1693.93 E:0.106420 |  Kane coming inside has that confidence and belief to play.
[4653.72 - 4656.72] P:1737.90 E:0.101485 |  The kind of passes that we know he can, and Saka then,
[4656.72 - 4659.72] P:1633.42 E:0.097721 |  they ended up doubling up in that situation.
[4659.72 - 4661.72] P:1721.81 E:0.104330 |  Denmark got another player back in there,
[4661.72 - 4664.72] P:1693.92 E:0.097372 |  so we couldn't quite get the scoring or shooting opportunity wanted,
[4664.72 - 4666.72] P:1763.73 E:0.093508 |  but it's just much better.
[4666.72 - 4668.72] P:1671.08 E:0.099869 |  It's a bit slicker to play quicker.
[4668.72 - 4671.72] P:1620.70 E:0.096301 |  Haven't seen enough of that from England tonight.
[4671.72 - 4673.72] P:1543.02 E:0.097294 |  Better in the second half?
[4673.72 - 4674.72] P:1605.90 E:0.105771 |  Marginally.
[4674.72 - 4676.72] P:1636.84 E:0.099831 |  Yeah, I'll tell you, the way we finished,
[4676.72 - 4680.72] P:1644.12 E:0.106666 |  or certainly the 15 or 10 minutes after we scored in the first half,
[4680.72 - 4682.72] P:1510.50 E:0.100654 |  was really poor.
[4682.72 - 4684.72] P:1624.05 E:0.103707 |  We just didn't get a hold of it at all.
[4685.72 - 4686.72] P:1600.94 E:0.111492 |  One-one.
[4686.72 - 4689.72] P:1549.00 E:0.107289 |  After Harry Kane shot England in front,
[4689.72 - 4694.72] P:1632.53 E:0.111765 |  Saka had a little touch as well in the build-up to the Kane goal.
[4694.72 - 4696.72] P:1322.21 E:0.108030 |  Gay, heads it on the half-way line,
[4696.72 - 4699.72] P:1560.00 E:0.111395 |  and then a super equaliser from Morton Hulman.
[4699.72 - 4702.72] P:1653.05 E:0.112584 |  Excellent shot from between 25 and 30 yards out.
[4702.72 - 4704.72] P:1645.62 E:0.100597 |  England now with Foden.
[4704.72 - 4706.72] P:1677.95 E:0.105006 |  Foden looks up. He's looking for Saka.
[4706.72 - 4708.72] P:1662.78 E:0.101151 |  Leoparded ball right across there,
[4708.72 - 4710.72] P:1823.66 E:0.105053 |  so they ask no top scorer this season.
[4710.72 - 4712.72] P:1822.82 E:0.105775 |  Takes on Mailer. Beats him.
[4712.72 - 4714.72] P:1685.30 E:0.104453 |  Saka then to the byline pulls that across,
[4714.72 - 4716.72] P:1824.71 E:0.099674 |  but that's intercepted by Andreas Christensen.
[4716.72 - 4719.72] P:1681.84 E:0.104019 |  And Denmark are able to get it away.
[4719.72 - 4721.72] P:1653.16 E:0.101383 |  England looking for Saka.
[4721.72 - 4723.72] P:1834.20 E:0.118539 |  John Stones passes it all the way back to Pickford,
[4723.72 - 4725.72] P:1891.57 E:0.115152 |  controls it on his thigh,
[4725.72 - 4727.72] P:1791.08 E:0.103498 |  and then passes it back to the Manchester City man,
[4727.72 - 4731.72] P:1669.02 E:0.090874 |  John Stones, winning his 74th cap tonight.
[4731.72 - 4734.72] P:1785.04 E:0.119425 |  And then Walker tried to pass it to Stones,
[4734.72 - 4736.72] P:1864.23 E:0.115123 |  passed it straight to Denmark,
[4736.72 - 4739.72] P:1879.89 E:0.108566 |  and then conceded a free kick on the left.
[4739.72 - 4742.72] P:1867.96 E:0.095506 |  He's frustrated with that car, Walker.
[4742.72 - 4744.72] P:1821.27 E:0.107526 |  He just couldn't quite find the pass.
[4744.72 - 4746.72] P:1738.60 E:0.090179 |  He was a little bit boxed in.
[4746.72 - 4748.72] P:1753.01 E:0.102688 |  He wanted to play inside, but he realised
[4748.72 - 4750.72] P:1849.21 E:0.098364 |  if that pass inside is not the right pass,
[4750.72 - 4752.72] P:1743.16 E:0.103691 |  he puts England bang in trouble,
[4752.72 - 4754.72] P:1644.23 E:0.087623 |  so he holds onto it too long,
[4754.72 - 4756.72] P:1835.78 E:0.102064 |  and then it gives a far away when Hoiberg
[4756.72 - 4758.72] P:1622.57 E:0.088559 |  makes quite a clean tackle,
[4758.72 - 4760.72] P:1732.50 E:0.106813 |  and it's a wide free kick in a dangerous area.
[4760.72 - 4762.72] P:1591.29 E:0.105105 |  What happened to Walker there is very typical
[4762.72 - 4764.72] P:1693.66 E:0.082841 |  of what's been happening in this match.
[4764.72 - 4766.72] P:1655.84 E:0.107148 |  It's not right for England.
[4766.72 - 4768.72] P:1655.07 E:0.106905 |  It's not the same amount of options are there.
[4768.72 - 4771.72] P:1655.22 E:0.099958 |  When the Dines get the ball, they appear to have the option.
[4771.72 - 4774.72] P:1652.16 E:0.097300 |  Danger here, an Ericsson free kick out on the left-hand side.
[4774.72 - 4776.72] P:1601.69 E:0.109433 |  Ericsson plays it in, but it hits Mark Gage,
[4776.72 - 4779.72] P:1766.04 E:0.112348 |  who's 10 yards away from the ball,
[4779.72 - 4782.72] P:1827.74 E:0.109656 |  and he did well to keep his feet there, Sucker.
[4782.72 - 4784.72] P:1709.27 E:0.100839 |  He was reeling.
[4784.72 - 4786.72] P:1593.37 E:0.102411 |  He rocked him a bit.
[4786.72 - 4789.72] P:1656.54 E:0.101675 |  Once, Muhammad Ali fought right here
[4789.72 - 4792.72] P:1679.96 E:0.106280 |  on this patch of land back in the 60s,
[4792.72 - 4797.72] P:1784.71 E:0.112052 |  and that was redolent of what might have been happening that day,
[4797.72 - 4801.72] P:1869.13 E:0.117778 |  as England win a free kick for a foul by Gallagher,
[4801.72 - 4803.72] P:1861.12 E:0.118312 |  who is yellow carded.
[4803.72 - 4805.72] P:1908.47 E:0.109560 |  So just minutes after coming on,
[4805.72 - 4807.72] P:1844.67 E:0.102996 |  there's a yellow card for Conor Gallagher.
[4807.72 - 4809.72] P:1865.99 E:0.095870 |  Yeah, just a little bit late,
[4809.72 - 4811.72] P:1709.09 E:0.090253 |  trying to put some energy,
[4811.72 - 4813.72] P:1595.41 E:0.102708 |  inject a bit of that into the midfield,
[4813.72 - 4815.72] P:1719.67 E:0.099112 |  and get off to the ball.
[4815.72 - 4816.72] P:1706.59 E:0.084249 |  He doesn't make it.
[4816.72 - 4818.72] P:1636.10 E:0.103801 |  I'm not too sure why he's given a yellow card.
[4818.72 - 4820.72] P:1717.84 E:0.103298 |  I think that's a little bit harsh.
[4820.72 - 4823.72] P:1558.45 E:0.098943 |  He gets his slight toe, maybe just stands on the top of the foot,
[4823.72 - 4826.72] P:1551.92 E:0.101852 |  but it wasn't a particularly vicious challenge.
[4826.72 - 4829.72] P:1394.87 E:0.105051 |  I'll, when we bring in Conor Cody next,
[4829.72 - 4833.72] P:1527.16 E:0.104035 |  maybe Conor give us an idea of who you might want to see
[4833.72 - 4837.72] P:1555.23 E:0.103185 |  Garrah Southgate call on next from off the substitute bench.
[4837.72 - 4839.72] P:1498.71 E:0.094514 |  But Denmark have this free kick,
[4839.72 - 4841.72] P:1524.71 E:0.098955 |  match poised at 1-1,
[4841.72 - 4844.72] P:1596.67 E:0.108146 |  and we have commentary next on one of the big games of the group stage,
[4844.72 - 4848.72] P:1664.06 E:0.107863 |  Spain, Italy, which will come to you live from Gelsenkirchen
[4848.72 - 4850.72] P:1631.65 E:0.110324 |  inside the Schalke Stadium,
[4850.72 - 4852.72] P:1559.36 E:0.100981 |  Ian Dennis and Chris Sutton from 8 o'clock,
[4852.72 - 4855.72] P:1757.37 E:0.107295 |  and the Castleford Hole KR Super League match
[4855.72 - 4857.72] P:1568.18 E:0.094540 |  will be on Sports Extra tonight.
[4857.72 - 4859.72] P:1567.33 E:0.101066 |  So a choice of listening there.
[4859.72 - 4861.72] P:1462.79 E:0.103253 |  England's cricket is played tomorrow afternoon, by the way.
[4861.72 - 4862.72] P:1470.62 E:0.104456 |  That's on Sports Extra.
[4862.72 - 4866.72] P:1403.97 E:0.109232 |  England against South Africa live from Lusha at the T20,
[4866.72 - 4871.72] P:1435.40 E:0.099218 |  which is on right now, Afghanistan, India.
[4871.72 - 4874.72] P:1336.17 E:0.110719 |  Denmark won England 1 here at the Euros
[4874.72 - 4876.72] P:1339.05 E:0.101718 |  in England's second group match.
[4876.72 - 4880.72] P:1450.04 E:0.102126 |  England, for most of this match, up against it, uninspiring.
[4880.72 - 4884.72] P:1347.76 E:0.098055 |  And Denmark, much brighter.
[4884.72 - 4890.72] P:1554.62 E:0.103773 |  You've got Hoiberg, who started just 10 matches for Tottenham this season.
[4890.72 - 4895.72] P:1634.30 E:0.104153 |  Christian Eriksen just 14 starts for Manchester United.
[4895.72 - 4898.72] P:1656.83 E:0.103889 |  They do look fresh, I have to say,
[4898.72 - 4901.72] P:1567.45 E:0.098742 |  as the ball is played out to the right-hand side by Damsegaard.
[4901.72 - 4904.72] P:1578.13 E:0.104248 |  And then Bar back into Damsegaard inside the penalty area.
[4904.72 - 4907.72] P:1683.43 E:0.100123 |  The Brentford man looking to turn, but Reis came in with a challenge.
[4907.72 - 4910.72] P:1666.59 E:0.102743 |  Kieran Trippier down there, passes it forward to Phil Forden.
[4910.72 - 4912.72] P:1657.70 E:0.094738 |  England, pinned in there, left-back position, played forward.
[4912.72 - 4914.72] P:1580.56 E:0.103487 |  Dellingham just got a header to that.
[4914.72 - 4915.72] P:1537.30 E:0.097727 |  Denmark are onto it.
[4915.72 - 4919.72] P:1620.64 E:0.103138 |  Conagalla comes forward, he heads it on, comes back to Reis.
[4919.72 - 4920.72] P:1740.70 E:0.108371 |  Reis in danger of losing out.
[4920.72 - 4923.72] P:1768.58 E:0.113221 |  Christian Eriksen onto this, but the left-foot shot flies away.
[4923.72 - 4926.72] P:1874.49 E:0.107614 |  High over the top of Jordan Picklitz, crossbar.
[4926.72 - 4930.72] P:1821.23 E:0.110374 |  But again, England just look uncertain.
[4930.72 - 4933.72] P:1821.84 E:0.116235 |  Caught on the ball, losing possession.
[4933.72 - 4937.72] P:1834.36 E:0.107617 |  It's been a bit of a game of not being settled enough with the ball.
[4937.72 - 4939.72] P:1763.98 E:0.110986 |  We always seem to be chasing the first touch,
[4939.72 - 4942.72] P:1777.74 E:0.103392 |  or the first touch is under pressure, which, credit to Denmark,
[4942.72 - 4944.72] P:1676.30 E:0.111253 |  they're pressurising really well,
[4944.72 - 4946.72] P:1727.15 E:0.104399 |  but it's not enabling us to really have good possession
[4946.72 - 4949.72] P:1673.27 E:0.112660 |  or be able to get on the ball and make our passes.
[4949.72 - 4953.72] P:1656.23 E:0.109770 |  Reis, Harry Kane, Forden, Bellingham,
[4953.72 - 4956.72] P:1561.64 E:0.100323 |  they've not had the time to really get on the ball,
[4956.72 - 4959.72] P:1667.34 E:0.103420 |  have a good first touch, be comfortable and find a good option.
[4959.72 - 4963.72] P:1688.47 E:0.094200 |  It's just harassed all the time, which credit to Denmark for that.
[4963.72 - 4967.72] P:1656.04 E:0.098211 |  Well, it's still all-square, but I think whatever happens here tonight,
[4967.72 - 4969.72] P:1603.65 E:0.107777 |  whether England win, lose or draw,
[4969.72 - 4972.72] P:1696.51 E:0.109336 |  there will be another torrent of criticism
[4972.72 - 4975.72] P:1656.43 E:0.090430 |  for the way that England have played.
[4977.72 - 4982.72] P:1645.07 E:0.095427 |  Here is Walker on the right-hand side, Saka, then Bellingham,
[4982.72 - 4985.72] P:1808.25 E:0.107411 |  looking strangely tentative.
[4985.72 - 4987.72] P:1953.86 E:0.123485 |  Then back to Pickford on the edge of the penalty area,
[4987.72 - 4990.72] P:2049.82 E:0.119530 |  and the Everton goalkeeper passes it out to Gay,
[4990.72 - 4993.72] P:1976.05 E:0.114388 |  and then, for it, Harry Kane drops into his own half,
[4994.72 - 4997.72] P:1950.44 E:0.102435 |  and the Anik Vestergaard goes with him,
[4997.72 - 4999.72] P:1840.16 E:0.123075 |  Vestergaard, who has been yellow-carded,
[4999.72 - 5001.72] P:1790.64 E:0.114896 |  but not been put under pressure at all.
[5001.72 - 5004.72] P:1953.50 E:0.103389 |  Now Kyle Walker carries the ball downfield, Bellingham.
[5004.72 - 5007.72] P:1899.14 E:0.093671 |  That's that change of feet again from Jude Bellingham.
[5007.72 - 5010.72] P:1835.05 E:0.123306 |  He just runs into the challenge and loses out to Damsegaard,
[5010.72 - 5013.72] P:1753.21 E:0.108389 |  who passes it forward, Mark Gay, Gamble there, it was the right decision.
[5013.72 - 5016.72] P:1795.19 E:0.113089 |  He won possession back, then he couldn't hit the pass forward.
[5016.72 - 5020.72] P:1774.06 E:0.111121 |  It was Kuhlman, who stepped into it, and then Inkoz Gay again.
[5020.72 - 5023.72] P:1786.32 E:0.113221 |  The England fans applauding Mark Gay's effort there.
[5023.72 - 5027.72] P:1855.91 E:0.100698 |  Walker, now Saka, Saka, up against Mailak.
[5027.72 - 5031.72] P:1899.16 E:0.099518 |  Mailak steps off, Saka with the cross, right across the penalty area.
[5031.72 - 5034.72] P:1832.98 E:0.116296 |  A applause from Phil Forden for the idea from Pukajosaka,
[5034.72 - 5036.72] P:1779.65 E:0.104540 |  but over-hit through Goldkick.
[5036.72 - 5039.72] P:1821.52 E:0.101606 |  I'm not sure we've really felt that threatening
[5039.72 - 5042.72] P:1879.07 E:0.111958 |  when the ball's wideened, we're going to score a goal.
[5042.72 - 5044.72] P:1878.36 E:0.109016 |  He'd been a good cross in positions,
[5044.72 - 5048.72] P:1835.44 E:0.108712 |  but it's not really looking like we're going to get the ball into the box,
[5048.72 - 5051.72] P:1803.04 E:0.098100 |  and somebody's arriving to get on the end of it.
[5051.72 - 5054.72] P:1724.18 E:0.108920 |  Right, well, I didn't get the chance to say to Konakori,
[5054.72 - 5057.72] P:1709.07 E:0.099906 |  because the changes are coming, and there's going to be three of them.
[5057.72 - 5059.72] P:1797.23 E:0.101253 |  I was going to say, Damsegaard, to be fair,
[5059.72 - 5062.72] P:1723.67 E:0.101444 |  I just had the idea that you might.
[5062.72 - 5067.72] P:1692.30 E:0.098857 |  Watkins, Bowen and Ezzar, 1920 and 21.
[5067.72 - 5071.72] P:1625.33 E:0.104406 |  So, a barragey, Ezzar going to come into the tournament
[5071.72 - 5074.72] P:1657.24 E:0.099600 |  for the first time, his first taste of tournament action.
[5074.72 - 5077.72] P:1582.79 E:0.107934 |  Bowen, who came on as the substitute the other night,
[5077.72 - 5083.72] P:1691.58 E:0.102875 |  and then Oli Watkins also, first chance to show what he can do on this stage,
[5083.72 - 5088.72] P:1739.90 E:0.107143 |  the big stage where England really tonight have very often fluffed their lines.
[5088.72 - 5091.72] P:1749.11 E:0.111974 |  And this will be very interesting to see who's coming off,
[5091.72 - 5094.72] P:1877.49 E:0.118276 |  as John Stones is put under pressure by Highland,
[5094.72 - 5097.72] P:1924.83 E:0.114611 |  and an unforced error passes it out of play,
[5097.72 - 5099.72] P:1870.20 E:0.113825 |  he's trying to give it the game,
[5099.72 - 5103.72] P:1858.14 E:0.100894 |  and that's a corner to Denmark, the cheapest of cheap corners.
[5103.72 - 5106.72] P:1834.61 E:0.106687 |  Yeah, Declan Rice looking really frustrated, it came into him,
[5106.72 - 5109.72] P:1811.67 E:0.103273 |  and again, there's no comfortable first touch,
[5109.72 - 5111.72] P:1826.88 E:0.108822 |  there's no comfortable situation on the ball,
[5111.72 - 5113.72] P:1861.54 E:0.107322 |  there's pressure all the time,
[5113.72 - 5116.72] P:1762.77 E:0.100447 |  and it's really testing the first touch, yes, the pitch isn't great,
[5116.72 - 5118.72] P:1806.09 E:0.105853 |  I think the ball is bobbling in a little bit,
[5118.72 - 5120.72] P:1809.09 E:0.107940 |  but you can't make excuses in that sense,
[5120.72 - 5122.72] P:1656.86 E:0.099075 |  it's the same for both teams,
[5122.72 - 5125.72] P:1802.92 E:0.110314 |  and Denmark have been better with their passing,
[5125.72 - 5127.72] P:1977.74 E:0.105503 |  more accurate and more fluent.
[5127.72 - 5129.72] P:1976.96 E:0.112388 |  Actually, Denmark are going to make the change first,
[5129.72 - 5131.72] P:1897.16 E:0.115363 |  and it's the experienced Yusuf Paulsen,
[5131.72 - 5133.72] P:1969.69 E:0.099951 |  who's coming on to win his 82nd cap,
[5133.72 - 5137.72] P:1878.38 E:0.115475 |  and Manchester United has to rest the Toilanders off,
[5137.72 - 5139.72] P:1790.47 E:0.107581 |  because he has made a nuisance of himself.
[5139.72 - 5142.72] P:1774.48 E:0.101845 |  It's a big surprise, physically he's been a real handful,
[5142.72 - 5144.72] P:1769.12 E:0.080454 |  but Paulsen is a big lad,
[5144.72 - 5146.72] P:1724.93 E:0.111474 |  I think they're looking to maybe get the ball in the box
[5146.72 - 5147.72] P:1810.95 E:0.108502 |  and get crosses in.
[5147.72 - 5149.72] P:1757.66 E:0.093334 |  Yeah, RB Leipzig forward,
[5149.72 - 5152.72] P:1788.85 E:0.100022 |  so it's a corner, England aren't making the changes yet,
[5152.72 - 5154.72] P:1679.82 E:0.102344 |  1-1, Ericsson with the deep corner,
[5154.72 - 5156.72] P:1710.94 E:0.101186 |  that bounces right to the edge of the penalty area,
[5156.72 - 5159.72] P:1791.12 E:0.102170 |  still in the England box, comes out to the edge of the box,
[5159.72 - 5162.72] P:1854.92 E:0.110546 |  and then the shot that Pickford is able to control,
[5162.72 - 5165.72] P:1879.35 E:0.110002 |  just above his head, he just parried it up in the air,
[5165.72 - 5167.72] P:1769.78 E:0.113979 |  and then on the follow-up,
[5167.72 - 5171.72] P:1900.61 E:0.112654 |  was able to gather the ball after the shot,
[5171.72 - 5175.72] P:1822.60 E:0.114485 |  I think it was Andreas Christensen, actually,
[5175.72 - 5179.72] P:1805.84 E:0.110020 |  who hit them, comes back to Pickford,
[5179.72 - 5182.72] P:1824.52 E:0.114733 |  and then to Trippie out on his right foot,
[5182.72 - 5184.72] P:1853.71 E:0.105972 |  chips it forward to Foulden,
[5184.72 - 5186.72] P:1730.54 E:0.100785 |  and then up to Kane,
[5186.72 - 5188.72] P:1788.62 E:0.109928 |  Denmark are in on the challenge on Harry Kane,
[5188.72 - 5192.72] P:1809.91 E:0.094917 |  strong and forward from Vestegard,
[5192.72 - 5196.72] P:1884.90 E:0.121086 |  Heubje goes down after a challenge,
[5196.72 - 5198.72] P:1968.05 E:0.106261 |  Denmark, play continues,
[5198.72 - 5202.72] P:1885.77 E:0.102163 |  the ball is chipped out towards the left-hand side,
[5202.72 - 5204.72] P:1652.28 E:0.109281 |  Mailer is there but he can't reach that,
[5204.72 - 5206.72] P:1856.88 E:0.112962 |  it's a throw into England in the right back area.
[5206.72 - 5211.72] P:1916.07 E:0.110112 |  And there's a classic example there about how we just haven't handled the ball well enough,
[5211.72 - 5213.72] P:1993.10 E:0.103208 |  in terms of sharpness, first touch,
[5213.72 - 5215.72] P:1773.74 E:0.104623 |  it just seems a little bit loose, John,
[5215.72 - 5217.72] P:1817.88 E:0.101979 |  almost like we're chasing a bad touch all the time.
[5217.72 - 5219.72] P:1665.64 E:0.100559 |  No where near, is it? No.
[5219.72 - 5224.72] P:1749.82 E:0.097767 |  Right, here come at least the first couple of the changes,
[5224.72 - 5229.72] P:1829.31 E:0.102461 |  and it is Phil Foulden who's going to be replaced by a Baruchie Ezzar.
[5229.72 - 5233.72] P:1855.32 E:0.107962 |  So on comes England's Crystal Palace man,
[5233.72 - 5236.72] P:1897.64 E:0.120281 |  who finished the season in such fine form,
[5236.72 - 5239.72] P:1961.33 E:0.116855 |  and off comes the Premier League player of the season,
[5239.72 - 5241.72] P:1860.21 E:0.121265 |  and Bukai Osaka as well,
[5241.72 - 5244.72] P:1901.12 E:0.107531 |  is the straight swap there for Jared Bohm on the right,
[5244.72 - 5247.72] P:1905.99 E:0.109712 |  you were kind of expecting this, Matt,
[5247.72 - 5249.72] P:1891.24 E:0.119277 |  and it is Harry Kane who's off,
[5249.72 - 5252.72] P:1880.33 E:0.100299 |  so the England captain substituted,
[5252.72 - 5255.72] P:1838.70 E:0.105466 |  and only Watkins comes on, that's a big call.
[5255.72 - 5257.72] P:1807.98 E:0.105523 |  You don't see that very often. You do not.
[5257.72 - 5261.72] P:1799.80 E:0.105917 |  In games where England need a goal, it's tight, it's 1-1,
[5261.72 - 5265.72] P:1829.68 E:0.114438 |  you don't normally see Harry Kane come off the pitch,
[5265.72 - 5268.72] P:1993.03 E:0.117065 |  but I think such as how the game's gone,
[5268.72 - 5271.72] P:1995.59 E:0.118588 |  just that injection of fresh legs and energy,
[5271.72 - 5276.72] P:1901.44 E:0.109980 |  and whatever else that brings is what Garis Southgate really feels
[5276.72 - 5278.72] P:1827.15 E:0.109106 |  this game needs to maybe tip it in England's way.
[5278.72 - 5281.72] P:1821.12 E:0.112135 |  Garis Southgate walks across, applauding Harry Kane,
[5281.72 - 5283.72] P:1842.43 E:0.112037 |  who comes off the field.
[5283.72 - 5285.72] P:2029.26 E:0.113874 |  Remember how he missed football at the end of the season,
[5285.72 - 5287.72] P:1962.57 E:0.106625 |  the back issue that he had,
[5287.72 - 5289.72] P:1986.33 E:0.116147 |  that they told us was absolutely fine,
[5289.72 - 5291.72] P:1889.76 E:0.113712 |  but even so, Conakordi,
[5291.72 - 5294.72] P:1822.33 E:0.104180 |  to see Harry Kane being substituted at a match at the Euros
[5294.72 - 5297.72] P:1681.54 E:0.104880 |  that's 1-1 with 20 minutes to play.
[5297.72 - 5299.72] P:1677.38 E:0.115281 |  Yeah, it's a really bold move,
[5299.72 - 5302.72] P:1722.45 E:0.108531 |  but I do like the idea of giving people who've had great seasons
[5302.72 - 5304.72] P:1722.89 E:0.120099 |  a lot of trust in this England team.
[5304.72 - 5306.72] P:1757.50 E:0.103371 |  Oli Watkins has been fantastic this year,
[5306.72 - 5308.72] P:1817.27 E:0.101470 |  and he fully deserves his place on his pitch at the minute,
[5308.72 - 5310.72] P:1802.73 E:0.110403 |  so I'm all for giving people him opportunities,
[5310.72 - 5312.72] P:1715.57 E:0.103667 |  because he's been brilliant all year.
[5312.72 - 5315.72] P:1759.88 E:0.104860 |  The Aston Villa top scorer, the 27-goal top scorer,
[5315.72 - 5318.72] P:1731.06 E:0.106477 |  Oli Watkins, what an opportunity this is now,
[5318.72 - 5320.72] P:1759.30 E:0.096825 |  in England changing the front three here.
[5320.72 - 5322.72] P:1760.42 E:0.096944 |  Saka, Kane and Foden are off,
[5322.72 - 5326.72] P:1692.55 E:0.095828 |  and it is Bun, Watkins and Ezzat who are on.
[5326.72 - 5329.72] P:1745.44 E:0.104425 |  About two months ago, we weren't expecting that, were we?
[5329.72 - 5332.72] P:1736.12 E:0.099673 |  No, but I think it's a big moment in the game for England.
[5332.72 - 5335.72] P:1673.53 E:0.107189 |  Maybe it can just spark a little bit more
[5335.72 - 5338.72] P:1654.60 E:0.094813 |  in this last 20 minutes or so.
[5338.72 - 5340.72] P:1610.29 E:0.116043 |  Still a big stage of this game left to play.
[5340.72 - 5343.72] P:1675.04 E:0.112152 |  The thing is, England have got to get the ball to them,
[5343.72 - 5345.72] P:1681.69 E:0.103587 |  and that's been an issue.
[5345.72 - 5347.72] P:1631.18 E:0.116579 |  As Trippier hits a right footer pass,
[5347.72 - 5349.72] P:1581.51 E:0.102255 |  that's nowhere near Watkins,
[5349.72 - 5351.72] P:1495.41 E:0.111172 |  and Denmark, that's the guards, able to take that down
[5351.72 - 5354.72] P:1542.71 E:0.101829 |  and just pass it in field to his central defensive partner,
[5354.72 - 5357.72] P:1846.34 E:0.108589 |  but Walker's onto this at pace, gets there ahead of Meila.
[5357.72 - 5360.72] P:1739.75 E:0.091137 |  Walker near the right corner of the box,
[5360.72 - 5362.72] P:1803.54 E:0.101752 |  he's actually been forced away wide,
[5362.72 - 5364.72] P:1859.81 E:0.104696 |  Bourne's got to involve for the first time,
[5364.72 - 5366.72] P:1853.42 E:0.100698 |  Jared Bourne wins the throw-in,
[5366.72 - 5369.72] P:1724.45 E:0.104532 |  Walker takes it, Gallagher turning the full 360 degrees,
[5369.72 - 5372.72] P:1818.38 E:0.098426 |  back to Walker who goes back to the halfway line.
[5372.72 - 5374.72] P:1892.19 E:0.097110 |  20 minutes to go here.
[5374.72 - 5377.72] P:1930.74 E:0.114531 |  Spain, Italy on the way, live from Gelsenkirchen,
[5377.72 - 5380.72] P:1937.85 E:0.108093 |  but a massive 20 minutes for Garis Southgate's England.
[5380.72 - 5383.72] P:1864.62 E:0.109919 |  It is 1-1, if you're listening to the tenor of what we're seeing,
[5383.72 - 5386.72] P:1844.83 E:0.108387 |  you'll be thinking, you know, hang on, what's going on?
[5386.72 - 5390.72] P:1835.17 E:0.104550 |  But this is nowhere near the performance that Garis Southgate
[5390.72 - 5392.72] P:1832.83 E:0.096162 |  and England were looking for.
[5392.72 - 5394.72] P:1750.59 E:0.099811 |  Here's Ezzer, deep-lying position.
[5394.72 - 5396.72] P:1739.30 E:0.099360 |  England will want him to run at me,
[5396.72 - 5398.72] P:1840.80 E:0.116874 |  depending on him through.
[5398.72 - 5400.72] P:1930.25 E:0.106790 |  Watkins for the chance from the angle,
[5400.72 - 5402.72] P:1905.48 E:0.110774 |  but Schmeichel comes out sliding,
[5402.72 - 5405.72] P:1933.03 E:0.106002 |  a blocker behind, it's a corner, that's more like it.
[5405.72 - 5407.72] P:1871.91 E:0.110994 |  Yeah, just a little sample of those really busy runs
[5407.72 - 5410.72] P:1855.48 E:0.115367 |  that Oli Watkins made, he bends it nicely, he is onside,
[5410.72 - 5412.72] P:1847.12 E:0.118837 |  he thought it was going to be given offside,
[5412.72 - 5416.72] P:1792.68 E:0.101251 |  but he gets there, Schmeichel comes out well, the angle's tight.
[5416.72 - 5418.72] P:1704.78 E:0.113210 |  But that's classic Oli Watkins, lovely run,
[5418.72 - 5421.72] P:1783.60 E:0.105290 |  just bent round into the corner of the box,
[5421.72 - 5423.72] P:1962.78 E:0.104201 |  a lovely pass from Bellingham, I think it was.
[5423.72 - 5424.72] P:2002.53 E:0.105823 |  Yes, it was.
[5424.72 - 5426.72] P:1980.76 E:0.112852 |  Jared Bourne, 10th cap tonight,
[5426.72 - 5429.72] P:1952.88 E:0.108658 |  he's going to take the corner from the right-hand side.
[5429.72 - 5432.72] P:1927.68 E:0.098545 |  England's first corner of the match.
[5432.72 - 5435.72] P:1853.51 E:0.103098 |  Bourne, into the near post, comes off a Denmark head,
[5435.72 - 5438.72] P:1780.39 E:0.097600 |  comes out to Tribya, Tribya nods it square to Gallagher.
[5438.72 - 5441.72] P:1723.87 E:0.110915 |  Gallagher rather awkwardly, he's always given it away,
[5441.72 - 5444.72] P:1887.94 E:0.110229 |  he couldn't find it as a Denmark could break forward.
[5444.72 - 5446.72] P:1802.92 E:0.107052 |  Christian Erikson's the man who's furthest forward,
[5446.72 - 5449.72] P:1712.52 E:0.096133 |  but Gallagher's able to come back and prevent his forward motion.
[5449.72 - 5452.72] P:1691.19 E:0.108897 |  But then taken on by Paul Sinner, back him from him,
[5452.72 - 5455.72] P:1736.46 E:0.108087 |  Bourne slips over, Christian Erikson tries to play it into the penalty area,
[5455.72 - 5459.72] P:1866.30 E:0.108433 |  blocked by Gallagher, who's certainly showing that energy that England need,
[5459.72 - 5462.72] P:1800.35 E:0.099818 |  but chasing shadows here, because Denmark again,
[5462.72 - 5465.72] P:1841.76 E:0.106757 |  with Christian Erikson, what a story this is,
[5465.72 - 5467.72] P:1729.31 E:0.102665 |  after what happened three years ago,
[5467.72 - 5470.72] P:1719.00 E:0.094287 |  Erikson right at the heart of things for Denmark.
[5471.72 - 5476.72] P:1360.10 E:0.097173 |  And they go back, Casper Hulmans side, back to the halfway line.
[5476.72 - 5480.72] P:1478.21 E:0.106043 |  They're certainly winning this on points, talking about boxing.
[5480.72 - 5486.72] P:1682.79 E:0.108892 |  Here again, Nela having switched flanks.
[5486.72 - 5489.72] P:1659.48 E:0.113658 |  Vestergaard, a little flick by Christian Erikson.
[5489.72 - 5491.72] P:1753.92 E:0.112634 |  Then the shot from distance, the pick-foot goes down,
[5491.72 - 5496.72] P:1801.85 E:0.108184 |  pushes it away, the shot from Hoipiam, saved by the Everton goalkeeper.
[5496.72 - 5500.72] P:1805.87 E:0.104226 |  And then a foul, and a yellow card, Nela.
[5500.72 - 5505.72] P:1597.98 E:0.106055 |  Just dived in rather on Jared Bourne, who gets the free kick,
[5505.72 - 5508.72] P:1658.48 E:0.106021 |  and a yellow card for Mela for that, 1-1.
[5508.72 - 5511.72] P:1625.07 E:0.098143 |  The flick from Erikson, the tiny little touch he put in there,
[5511.72 - 5515.72] P:1496.83 E:0.107561 |  was just exquisite, just enough to just flick it round the corner
[5515.72 - 5518.72] P:1626.53 E:0.107193 |  into the path of his teammate, who gets the shot off,
[5518.72 - 5521.72] P:1561.89 E:0.102915 |  pick-foot parries to the right-hand side.
[5521.72 - 5525.72] P:1447.39 E:0.111583 |  And as per the whole game, Mela goes in for the tackle,
[5525.72 - 5529.72] P:1581.79 E:0.102599 |  and a big chunk of turf flies up in the air, and onto the ground.
[5529.72 - 5531.72] P:1738.87 E:0.100642 |  I think Bowen stopped awkwardly just before that,
[5531.72 - 5533.72] P:1745.18 E:0.099009 |  and felt his ankle afterwards.
[5533.72 - 5535.72] P:1844.50 E:0.087887 |  He just put the break, and I think this is mainly happening
[5535.72 - 5537.72] P:1833.57 E:0.111180 |  when people are putting the brakes on, John.
[5537.72 - 5539.72] P:1744.13 E:0.096673 |  It's just collapsing underneath their feet.
[5539.72 - 5542.72] P:1578.32 E:0.098927 |  Yeah, the pitch has been nowhere near what you would want
[5542.72 - 5545.72] P:1780.38 E:0.089678 |  for a match of this calibre after all of the rain.
[5545.72 - 5548.72] P:1816.26 E:0.112826 |  So soft, oh, the ball has won back by Watkins near the edge
[5548.72 - 5550.72] P:1750.72 E:0.110142 |  of the penalty area challenge comes in.
[5550.72 - 5552.72] P:1829.29 E:0.122222 |  Schmeichel's going to do well to reach that,
[5552.72 - 5554.72] P:1857.54 E:0.115275 |  no, he can't, Sprint, Nuit, Wieslef,
[5554.72 - 5556.72] P:1841.17 E:0.118462 |  and Oli Watkins has looked sharp, and Oli Watkins,
[5556.72 - 5559.72] P:1897.84 E:0.110337 |  and Bellingham as well, just turning Bellingham
[5559.72 - 5561.72] P:1795.38 E:0.106883 |  to the England fans in the stands,
[5561.72 - 5563.72] P:1825.30 E:0.105107 |  and wailing his arms and saying, come on,
[5563.72 - 5566.72] P:1900.97 E:0.107977 |  because Denmark, they've been the noisiest.
[5566.72 - 5568.72] P:1731.48 E:0.104378 |  I don't think there's any doubt about that,
[5568.72 - 5570.72] P:1796.61 E:0.101719 |  because that's what's reflected what's been happening on the field.
[5570.72 - 5573.72] P:1899.28 E:0.096851 |  Corner, then, Bowen to take this.
[5573.72 - 5577.72] P:1904.63 E:0.111777 |  Jared Bowen places it down in the quadrant.
[5577.72 - 5580.72] P:1931.00 E:0.111005 |  And Barra Ciaz, he goes over there as an option,
[5580.72 - 5583.72] P:1911.70 E:0.104036 |  but I think he will swing it in to the near post.
[5583.72 - 5586.72] P:1785.40 E:0.110719 |  Here it is, and it's headed away by Hoipier,
[5586.72 - 5589.72] P:1749.01 E:0.107816 |  and will bounce out of play near the halfway line
[5589.72 - 5592.72] P:1740.13 E:0.091627 |  for an England throw-in.
[5592.72 - 5594.72] P:1623.36 E:0.114522 |  As that, he's still over there on that far side,
[5594.72 - 5596.72] P:1691.04 E:0.104502 |  actually just leaves it to Kyle Walker,
[5596.72 - 5599.72] P:1678.37 E:0.097146 |  and Walker takes a quick throw down the line to Jared Bowen.
[5599.72 - 5604.72] P:1757.71 E:0.115010 |  Bowen, then, and this plays as a pass out of play.
[5604.72 - 5606.72] P:1801.29 E:0.120934 |  I did wonder whether he'd taken it flat.
[5606.72 - 5608.72] P:1880.53 E:0.117092 |  And Walker, Walker was just holding onto the ball,
[5608.72 - 5609.72] P:1923.81 E:0.111487 |  and the Danish fans are saying,
[5609.72 - 5611.72] P:1886.50 E:0.115893 |  hang on, what about a yellow card for Kyle Walker,
[5611.72 - 5615.72] P:1881.99 E:0.102560 |  but referee Suarez Diaz has been kind again to England.
[5615.72 - 5618.72] P:1783.42 E:0.092708 |  Yeah, whether or not it was long enough for a yellow card,
[5618.72 - 5620.72] P:1818.40 E:0.110554 |  the referee didn't feel so.
[5620.72 - 5623.72] P:1876.87 E:0.105178 |  I mean, he did jog away with the ball as opposed to just releasing it.
[5623.72 - 5629.72] P:1729.82 E:0.106377 |  It was a big cry from those Danish fans all sat over the far side of the stand.
[5629.72 - 5632.72] P:1620.86 E:0.097618 |  Do you remember Qatar, the second match there,
[5632.72 - 5634.72] P:1636.43 E:0.111428 |  the nil-nil with the United States?
[5634.72 - 5635.72] P:1558.55 E:0.107101 |  Yes, I do.
[5635.72 - 5637.72] P:1692.50 E:0.110005 |  And do you remember the last Euros, the second match there,
[5637.72 - 5639.72] P:1692.02 E:0.114961 |  the nil-nil with Scotland?
[5639.72 - 5640.72] P:1889.62 E:0.093294 |  Yes.
[5640.72 - 5644.72] P:1710.35 E:0.104396 |  Was it better than this one from England's performance?
[5644.72 - 5646.72] P:1693.09 E:0.087853 |  Stamptons?
[5646.72 - 5648.72] P:1463.26 E:0.106961 |  I would say on a par.
[5648.72 - 5649.72] P:1499.47 E:0.105007 |  Yeah.
[5649.72 - 5654.72] P:1452.30 E:0.106597 |  And there was a reaction to that, as there will be a reaction to this,
[5654.72 - 5656.72] P:1621.24 E:0.096157 |  because England have not played very well.
[5656.72 - 5658.72] P:1472.25 E:0.113150 |  That's a simple matter.
[5658.72 - 5661.72] P:1567.74 E:0.114351 |  I think you can't be at your best all the time,
[5661.72 - 5663.72] P:1600.36 E:0.106943 |  and you've got to, if it's not a good day,
[5663.72 - 5665.72] P:1725.03 E:0.105188 |  you make the best of a bad day, don't you?
[5665.72 - 5668.72] P:1719.96 E:0.123121 |  And as long as England see this through to a point
[5668.72 - 5673.72] P:1703.09 E:0.117409 |  and get through to the third group stage game with four points,
[5673.72 - 5675.72] P:1693.64 E:0.115023 |  it's not a bad return, John.
[5675.72 - 5677.72] P:1826.05 E:0.117085 |  That's well played by Bourn Noyes,
[5677.72 - 5680.72] P:1789.06 E:0.112951 |  actually committed the foul on Vestigard on the halfway line,
[5680.72 - 5683.72] P:1774.34 E:0.104541 |  so it's a free-pick to Denmark.
[5683.72 - 5686.72] P:1750.09 E:0.100079 |  Just to the left of the centre circle.
[5686.72 - 5688.72] P:1669.16 E:0.101188 |  The third match in the group.
[5688.72 - 5691.72] P:1734.48 E:0.114603 |  Remember if England were able to turn this round and snatch a winner,
[5691.72 - 5693.72] P:1892.44 E:0.106000 |  that would be then through as group winners.
[5693.72 - 5697.72] P:1884.20 E:0.107863 |  But that is not looking the most likely outcome here.
[5697.72 - 5700.72] P:1910.42 E:0.108550 |  The third match is on Tuesday, and that's a night match.
[5700.72 - 5702.72] P:1806.62 E:0.110969 |  That's a late match as well.
[5702.72 - 5704.72] P:1771.11 E:0.095606 |  8 o'clock UK time against Slovenia.
[5704.72 - 5707.72] P:1682.93 E:0.100940 |  I thought it looked quite dangerous to get to Serbia today.
[5707.72 - 5709.72] P:1681.32 E:0.103495 |  Denmark won, England won.
[5709.72 - 5711.72] P:1678.95 E:0.097368 |  Denmark again on the front foot.
[5711.72 - 5713.72] P:1683.35 E:0.092622 |  Ericsson back to Hoibje,
[5713.72 - 5716.72] P:1743.83 E:0.111042 |  who's going to have a goal from distance through a crowd of players
[5716.72 - 5719.72] P:1805.91 E:0.110047 |  that Jordan Pickford was able to deal with that
[5719.72 - 5721.72] P:1736.01 E:0.102536 |  and give it out to Kyle Walker,
[5721.72 - 5724.72] P:1702.60 E:0.102466 |  and then urges him, sends him on his way, short past to Gallagher.
[5724.72 - 5726.72] P:1819.87 E:0.120182 |  Gallagher couldn't find the ball back to Walker.
[5726.72 - 5728.72] P:1731.89 E:0.109106 |  He's got a great start again,
[5728.72 - 5730.72] P:1604.75 E:0.111181 |  and the thousands and thousands of Danish fans
[5730.72 - 5732.72] P:1645.31 E:0.093060 |  wall their team on again.
[5732.72 - 5735.72] P:1668.40 E:0.103561 |  It's one of their national characteristics, isn't it?
[5735.72 - 5737.72] P:1709.06 E:0.090109 |  Roaring.
[5737.72 - 5740.72] P:1735.14 E:0.102343 |  And here, the ball on the halfway line with Denmark.
[5740.72 - 5743.72] P:1684.29 E:0.109624 |  Now, back to the right-hand side, to Joachim Andersen.
[5743.72 - 5746.72] P:1670.50 E:0.102366 |  We are into the last 15 minutes now.
[5746.72 - 5750.72] P:1580.97 E:0.101653 |  Garaslavke stalks and walks around
[5750.72 - 5753.72] P:1811.17 E:0.112086 |  for other anxious-looking gay against Paulson.
[5753.72 - 5757.72] P:1854.41 E:0.118883 |  The two of them tangling, the ball runs away for what he's given
[5757.72 - 5760.72] P:1953.55 E:0.116589 |  as a goal kick. Paulson can't believe it.
[5760.72 - 5763.72] P:1975.30 E:0.112362 |  He's making a gesture to the referee.
[5763.72 - 5767.72] P:1924.87 E:0.099471 |  There was a hefty pullback from Mark Gehrie.
[5767.72 - 5770.72] P:1885.73 E:0.107175 |  I think Gehrie's trying to see the ball out of play.
[5770.72 - 5772.72] P:1729.41 E:0.090734 |  Paulson kind of nudges him out of the way,
[5772.72 - 5774.72] P:1823.50 E:0.106720 |  and then there's almost a bit of a headlock moment going on.
[5774.72 - 5776.72] P:1806.15 E:0.101638 |  I don't think there's a foul there.
[5776.72 - 5778.72] P:1784.58 E:0.110526 |  I think Paulson goes down really easily.
[5778.72 - 5780.72] P:1831.11 E:0.091780 |  It is a bit scrappy.
[5780.72 - 5782.72] P:1904.80 E:0.121155 |  I think Pickford's looking at the situation,
[5782.72 - 5784.72] P:1936.48 E:0.115520 |  and I'm just going to go long here at the moment.
[5784.72 - 5786.72] P:1699.41 E:0.101750 |  I'm not going to tickle the ball short.
[5786.72 - 5788.72] P:1678.00 E:0.106231 |  We haven't been good enough with the ball,
[5788.72 - 5791.72] P:1749.14 E:0.105994 |  certainly in our defensive third to risk playing out at the moment.
[5791.72 - 5794.72] P:1889.24 E:0.117147 |  But if he does go long, what happens is exactly what did happen.
[5794.72 - 5797.72] P:1699.83 E:0.102375 |  He turned the ball over, gets headed back to Kasper Schmeichel,
[5797.72 - 5800.72] P:1656.68 E:0.104360 |  and then Denmark starts to build again from the back.
[5800.72 - 5803.72] P:1603.44 E:0.109847 |  Conakory is here with us, the Leicester City in England.
[5803.72 - 5806.72] P:1393.35 E:0.105969 |  The interesting thing here, Conak, when we get a chance,
[5806.72 - 5808.72] P:1568.50 E:0.115210 |  is Denmark play, going forward towards Pickford,
[5808.72 - 5810.72] P:1674.61 E:0.107731 |  who's going to deal with that easily.
[5810.72 - 5813.72] P:1700.23 E:0.116942 |  You know what the tournament mindset and thought will be
[5813.72 - 5817.72] P:1684.18 E:0.111815 |  right now inside the England camp with Gareth Southgate
[5817.72 - 5819.72] P:1636.33 E:0.108857 |  after a match in a performance like this.
[5819.72 - 5822.72] P:1637.85 E:0.105018 |  But just hang on, because England with Gallagher,
[5822.72 - 5824.72] P:1587.97 E:0.099923 |  give it to Walker.
[5824.72 - 5827.72] P:1590.95 E:0.108108 |  Walker then turns and back it goes to John Stones,
[5827.72 - 5830.72] P:1479.44 E:0.103956 |  just over 10 minutes to go here in Frankfurt
[5830.72 - 5832.72] P:1717.06 E:0.100078 |  with the sun shining.
[5832.72 - 5835.72] P:1719.86 E:0.103435 |  John Stones, ball at his feet, dappled sunshine,
[5835.72 - 5838.72] P:1691.00 E:0.108574 |  moves through it to his left, gives it to Gea,
[5838.72 - 5841.72] P:1701.13 E:0.107078 |  and then the Beretschiazis not had a chance to run
[5841.72 - 5843.72] P:1792.81 E:0.113149 |  and then passes the ball forward.
[5843.72 - 5846.72] P:1775.01 E:0.109279 |  Oli Watkins chases after it, not sure he'll catch up with it.
[5846.72 - 5848.72] P:1771.98 E:0.118500 |  No, he reached it just as it got to the white line,
[5848.72 - 5850.72] P:1792.82 E:0.114226 |  put his foot on it and it rolled over.
[5850.72 - 5852.72] P:1794.54 E:0.104844 |  So, coming Conakory.
[5852.72 - 5854.72] P:1637.74 E:0.105835 |  Yeah, I think a big thing for me, John, is...
[5854.72 - 5856.72] P:1654.03 E:0.115376 |  Listen, I think we can all see here that England haven't been
[5856.72 - 5858.72] P:1553.59 E:0.101671 |  at the best, I think England haven't played great.
[5858.72 - 5860.72] P:1449.55 E:0.104267 |  I think Denmark have been better.
[5860.72 - 5862.72] P:1601.82 E:0.110618 |  I think a big one, even though you want to win these games,
[5862.72 - 5864.72] P:1657.33 E:0.109671 |  I think it's important, you don't lose this now,
[5864.72 - 5866.72] P:1649.50 E:0.104342 |  I think 12 minutes to go. I think the mentality is,
[5866.72 - 5868.72] P:1591.12 E:0.122647 |  you can go and win it with the players who have given them
[5868.72 - 5870.72] P:1790.89 E:0.112088 |  a little bit of life, I'll be honest.
[5870.72 - 5872.72] P:1668.08 E:0.117803 |  I think Oli Watkins running behind,
[5872.72 - 5874.72] P:1571.62 E:0.114054 |  Ines A and Bowen running behind, I think they've given
[5874.72 - 5876.72] P:1694.43 E:0.107080 |  a bit of life, but I think it's important now
[5876.72 - 5878.72] P:1640.13 E:0.107997 |  they do not lose this game in the next 12, 15 minutes.
[5878.72 - 5881.72] P:1567.43 E:0.110753 |  Yeah, and we talked, Matt, you and I, on air and off air,
[5881.72 - 5884.72] P:1418.27 E:0.098578 |  about England growing into the tournament.
[5884.72 - 5887.72] P:1613.29 E:0.096377 |  Actually, they've gone in the other direction in this match.
[5887.72 - 5889.72] P:1721.59 E:0.104156 |  Yeah, I'd agree with that.
[5889.72 - 5892.72] P:1684.89 E:0.100725 |  Well, if the result stays like this, that would be the case,
[5892.72 - 5895.72] P:1507.87 E:0.112930 |  and the performance probably...
[5895.72 - 5897.72] P:1534.69 E:0.117784 |  Definitely with the ball, it's really surprising.
[5897.72 - 5901.72] P:1552.89 E:0.116836 |  We haven't managed to really be confident and control it at all.
[5901.72 - 5904.72] P:1773.12 E:0.122031 |  As I caught in possession by Hoibje, he's fortunate.
[5904.72 - 5906.72] P:1825.56 E:0.111522 |  Fortunate there.
[5906.72 - 5910.72] P:1727.39 E:0.119528 |  The referee has been a came claim to England, Hoibje.
[5910.72 - 5912.72] P:1731.00 E:0.115411 |  Paulson, who felt he should have had a free kick
[5912.72 - 5914.72] P:1638.45 E:0.114362 |  a few moments earlier against Gage.
[5914.72 - 5916.72] P:1603.79 E:0.100845 |  He's the assistant that flagged as well,
[5916.72 - 5919.72] P:1774.91 E:0.102074 |  but I think Hoibje is close enough to the ball
[5919.72 - 5921.72] P:1791.30 E:0.100982 |  to warrant that kind of contact.
[5921.72 - 5923.72] P:1676.55 E:0.096781 |  The ball is identical distance between him and Eze.
[5923.72 - 5925.72] P:1613.84 E:0.106193 |  He has a right to use his body there
[5925.72 - 5928.72] P:1710.37 E:0.103830 |  and try and manoeuvre him out of the way, and he does that well.
[5928.72 - 5931.72] P:1802.39 E:0.096247 |  Denmark won, England won.
[5931.72 - 5933.72] P:1839.00 E:0.112426 |  commentary to come from 8 o'clock, UK time.
[5933.72 - 5935.72] P:1660.97 E:0.108517 |  Spain against this, and he don't miss that.
[5935.72 - 5939.72] P:1711.91 E:0.105986 |  Gage with a pass forward over the half-way line, looking for Eze.
[5939.72 - 5943.72] P:1540.21 E:0.107148 |  England want to try and get him running at the Denmark defence,
[5943.72 - 5945.72] P:1487.39 E:0.095895 |  but it's Denmark in possession.
[5945.72 - 5947.72] P:1527.45 E:0.112449 |  Back it goes towards the half-way line,
[5947.72 - 5950.72] P:1609.47 E:0.104342 |  the quite long-haired Joachim Andersen
[5950.72 - 5953.72] P:1551.18 E:0.109845 |  talking about all the Crystal Palace men in the England team.
[5953.72 - 5955.72] P:1496.24 E:0.112682 |  Here's one in the Danish side-up,
[5955.72 - 5959.72] P:1406.60 E:0.107964 |  and so you've got Eze up against his team-mate Joachim Andersen
[5959.72 - 5961.72] P:1595.88 E:0.112747 |  who turns, sees Eze in front of him,
[5961.72 - 5963.72] P:1387.05 E:0.103744 |  and then very quickly passes it back to the goalkeeper.
[5963.72 - 5967.72] P:1700.07 E:0.103250 |  It's not quite got the Griezmann-George-Michael-Lotz, is it?
[5967.72 - 5969.72] P:1560.62 E:0.107885 |  No, he's having a go.
[5969.72 - 5971.72] P:1678.89 E:0.114314 |  Griezmann's unmatched.
[5971.72 - 5972.72] P:1862.73 E:0.116057 |  No.
[5972.72 - 5976.72] P:1746.60 E:0.110222 |  As the ball bounces out for a throw on the far side for England.
[5976.72 - 5978.72] P:1558.51 E:0.102461 |  That was a little sloppy by Denmark.
[5978.72 - 5980.72] P:1675.76 E:0.101074 |  Excellent performance from Denmark.
[5980.72 - 5982.72] P:1651.94 E:0.105199 |  Massive improvement from them on their first match.
[5982.72 - 5984.72] P:1656.54 E:0.099875 |  Should be said against Slovenia,
[5984.72 - 5986.72] P:1661.16 E:0.105099 |  and Kastri Hulman's going to make another couple of changes.
[5986.72 - 5990.72] P:1775.52 E:0.105048 |  I see Andreas Skol Olsson's coming on, the Bruges player.
[5990.72 - 5995.72] P:1751.90 E:0.107705 |  He's a winger, and also, I think that's Christian Norgaard, isn't it?
[5995.72 - 5997.72] P:1866.08 E:0.110266 |  A Brenford, he answers, coming on.
[5997.72 - 5999.72] P:1863.16 E:0.112363 |  So another of the Brenford men,
[5999.72 - 6001.72] P:1862.96 E:0.116288 |  Thomas Frank, their manager, part of our coverage.
[6001.72 - 6003.72] P:1921.83 E:0.111133 |  Jon Stoens goes to a long pass from the half-way line.
[6003.72 - 6005.72] P:1759.95 E:0.110035 |  That's headed down and away by Joachim Andersen.
[6005.72 - 6008.72] P:1802.43 E:0.105168 |  That's given away by Hulman to Jude Bellingham,
[6008.72 - 6011.72] P:1788.39 E:0.108296 |  who's been very quiet in the second half.
[6011.72 - 6014.72] P:1699.98 E:0.113361 |  Bourne tries to slip in Watkins on the edge of the area.
[6014.72 - 6017.72] P:1716.57 E:0.104167 |  That's turned away by Christensen out for the far side,
[6017.72 - 6020.72] P:1744.99 E:0.103037 |  and it's a throw in to England down there.
[6020.72 - 6022.72] P:1831.25 E:0.107015 |  It always has a positive touch, Jared Bourne.
[6022.72 - 6024.72] P:1806.51 E:0.094837 |  Wherever he goes, he likes to take the ball with him,
[6024.72 - 6026.72] P:1726.73 E:0.108145 |  or he steps in so well.
[6026.72 - 6028.72] P:1770.70 E:0.105764 |  Very nearly finds Olly Watkins.
[6028.72 - 6031.72] P:1791.01 E:0.108136 |  You just can't take the ball with him when he slides the ball forward,
[6031.72 - 6034.72] P:1838.62 E:0.119355 |  coming inside off the line.
[6034.72 - 6036.72] P:1968.59 E:0.119818 |  And it's the goal scorer.
[6036.72 - 6039.72] P:1933.81 E:0.112565 |  England substituted their goal scorer, the captain Harry Kane.
[6039.72 - 6041.72] P:1917.10 E:0.114458 |  Denmark are taking theirs off.
[6041.72 - 6044.72] P:1950.12 E:0.117771 |  Morton Hulman and Christian Erikson
[6044.72 - 6047.72] P:1879.86 E:0.108849 |  are also walking towards this side of the field.
[6049.72 - 6052.72] P:1877.99 E:0.113207 |  Yeah, that's it. That's going to be the end of his afternoon.
[6052.72 - 6055.72] P:1904.56 E:0.117754 |  He's equaled Simon Kers' record here.
[6055.72 - 6060.72] P:1948.79 E:0.108059 |  Christian Erikson is now the joint most-capped player for Denmark
[6060.72 - 6064.72] P:1788.42 E:0.104529 |  at the age of 32, his 132nd cap.
[6064.72 - 6066.72] P:1586.57 E:0.091649 |  He's been excellent.
[6066.72 - 6068.72] P:1730.90 E:0.111086 |  Oh, he's been brilliant. Really good.
[6068.72 - 6071.72] P:1733.96 E:0.100042 |  I mean, he's just controlled so many matters of the game.
[6071.72 - 6073.72] P:1849.15 E:0.101209 |  He's pulling strings, he's finding space.
[6073.72 - 6075.72] P:1636.32 E:0.116565 |  You know, they always say about top players,
[6075.72 - 6078.72] P:1659.95 E:0.107487 |  but he looks so relaxed and comfortable in this place.
[6078.72 - 6080.72] P:1617.68 E:0.111973 |  He never looks rushed at all.
[6080.72 - 6082.72] P:1728.44 E:0.116869 |  His first touch, he really looks like...
[6082.72 - 6085.72] P:1488.09 E:0.111230 |  He's come back to the Euros, where those awful events happened
[6085.72 - 6088.72] P:1403.05 E:0.109249 |  three years ago with a real determination
[6088.72 - 6092.72] P:1356.52 E:0.111100 |  to put that absolutely in the past.
[6092.72 - 6096.72] P:1699.85 E:0.100584 |  1-1, five-life, BBC sounds.
[6096.72 - 6099.72] P:1631.86 E:0.104145 |  It's on BBC One as well, if you're nearly home.
[6099.72 - 6102.72] P:1581.74 E:0.107651 |  And Denmark, after the England throw, they lose possession.
[6102.72 - 6105.72] P:1564.60 E:0.097234 |  England, Denmark with a little flick in field,
[6105.72 - 6107.72] P:1576.96 E:0.111469 |  but that gives it back to Rice.
[6107.72 - 6109.72] P:1927.50 E:0.121255 |  That's a little short from Guy, and he's lost it,
[6109.72 - 6112.72] P:1856.83 E:0.116382 |  and now it's taken for it by Bar into the England area.
[6112.72 - 6116.72] P:1853.33 E:0.112693 |  And then Eklund recovery from Mark Guy to put in the challenge,
[6116.72 - 6119.72] P:1896.49 E:0.109125 |  because Bar was in two minds there,
[6119.72 - 6121.72] P:1909.68 E:0.115443 |  whether they should or whether they sent it,
[6121.72 - 6123.72] P:1874.00 E:0.102186 |  and Guy took advantage of that,
[6123.72 - 6125.72] P:1834.42 E:0.104706 |  and put in the top.
[6125.72 - 6127.72] P:1818.60 E:0.110054 |  He did. He tried to kind of...
[6127.72 - 6129.72] P:1883.75 E:0.113116 |  It was a difficult ball back to him, he didn't have a lot of option.
[6129.72 - 6132.72] P:1848.42 E:0.103884 |  Tried to win it, but then you can only gauge a mistake
[6132.72 - 6136.72] P:1763.39 E:0.097012 |  by the reaction, his reaction is absolutely spot-on.
[6136.72 - 6139.72] P:1724.92 E:0.105607 |  Gets his head down, pumps his arms, works his way back in
[6139.72 - 6142.72] P:1691.98 E:0.102053 |  to the penalty box and gets a really important blocking.
[6142.72 - 6144.72] P:1759.71 E:0.102551 |  But I think the pitch might have done us a little favour there as well.
[6144.72 - 6147.72] P:1721.09 E:0.104436 |  It was just bobbling up, and I don't think Bar was too happy with it.
[6147.72 - 6150.72] P:1879.46 E:0.117290 |  Score awesome with the corner into the near post.
[6150.72 - 6152.72] P:1658.37 E:0.100764 |  Oh, the chance, and that scooped over the bar.
[6152.72 - 6155.72] P:1749.80 E:0.091910 |  And actually, it was falling there,
[6155.72 - 6160.72] P:1756.75 E:0.113957 |  and I think possibly slipping as well as he went for goal.
[6160.72 - 6162.72] P:1923.28 E:0.112102 |  Is it Christensen?
[6162.72 - 6166.72] P:1822.41 E:0.115555 |  It was Andreas Christensen, and he scooped it over from six yards out.
[6166.72 - 6168.72] P:1868.64 E:0.103435 |  I say scooped it over, he skied it.
[6168.72 - 6171.72] P:1776.51 E:0.101144 |  Yeah, well, she'd scored, really.
[6171.72 - 6175.72] P:1717.52 E:0.106189 |  Just can't step in. It's a difficult one if your body weight's not forward
[6175.72 - 6178.72] P:1789.86 E:0.105573 |  and you're leaning back, which he was, is why the ball went so high,
[6178.72 - 6180.72] P:1863.37 E:0.112862 |  but Paulson really made himself a hamster.
[6180.72 - 6183.72] P:1743.58 E:0.113397 |  England have lost it again, Denmark take it on towards the edge of the penalty area.
[6183.72 - 6185.72] P:1811.24 E:0.100629 |  Gallagher's in there, right for Chopped,
[6185.72 - 6188.72] P:1785.25 E:0.110211 |  calling all narrowly wide of the top corner.
[6188.72 - 6191.72] P:1857.11 E:0.108102 |  Flashers pass, Jordan Pickford's left post.
[6191.72 - 6193.72] P:1921.79 E:0.110774 |  Goodness me.
[6193.72 - 6196.72] P:1905.91 E:0.113225 |  And England there, again losing possession.
[6196.72 - 6198.72] P:1980.83 E:0.111860 |  So close.
[6198.72 - 6202.72] P:1826.54 E:0.106835 |  Garry Southgate pointing to the side of his head as if to say focus.
[6202.72 - 6206.72] P:1843.27 E:0.111404 |  We've lost our focus, and it's been like that for big parts of this football match.
[6206.72 - 6210.72] P:1812.19 E:0.101400 |  Hoiberg looking to the skies, because that is a great opportunity
[6210.72 - 6213.72] P:1955.45 E:0.111069 |  with his right foot, he's got the marker of a player in front of him.
[6213.72 - 6216.72] P:1993.73 E:0.113237 |  Just bend it round and hit the target, it's in the back of the net,
[6216.72 - 6219.72] P:2011.99 E:0.112293 |  he puts it wide, it's a real let-off for England.
[6219.72 - 6224.72] P:1976.93 E:0.106907 |  Oh, massive. Christensen from the corner, then Hoiberg with that shot.
[6224.72 - 6227.72] P:1774.46 E:0.104589 |  And England, at this rate, the phrase that you'll use will be,
[6227.72 - 6229.72] P:1829.02 E:0.107306 |  escape with a draw.
[6229.72 - 6231.72] P:1706.24 E:0.100140 |  We have to go along with the ball, John, every time.
[6231.72 - 6235.72] P:1672.76 E:0.100533 |  I don't think Pickford feels comfortable even setting up to play out at the moment,
[6235.72 - 6239.72] P:1684.92 E:0.104529 |  like Connor said a while ago, just get through this game, 1-1,
[6239.72 - 6243.72] P:1778.05 E:0.114524 |  and then we'll have a row about it afterwards and debrief,
[6243.72 - 6246.72] P:1765.79 E:0.118160 |  but keep it at 1-1 and get your point.
[6246.72 - 6249.72] P:1712.71 E:0.113324 |  We're going into the last five minutes now,
[6249.72 - 6254.72] P:1696.58 E:0.117918 |  and in England, look a world away from winning the Euros
[6254.72 - 6257.72] P:1729.02 E:0.113926 |  on the evidence of what's happened here in this match.
[6257.72 - 6260.72] P:1713.03 E:0.110816 |  Having taken the lead in the 18th minute,
[6260.72 - 6265.72] P:1692.76 E:0.107021 |  Mark Gaye, long and right-footed, Bellingham forward,
[6265.72 - 6271.72] P:1651.95 E:0.097984 |  Gallagher and Dorn chasing after it, but it is Denmark in possession,
[6271.72 - 6274.72] P:1548.30 E:0.103125 |  and Nail are out there, back to the halfway line,
[6274.72 - 6277.72] P:1648.18 E:0.107859 |  across it comes to Hoibier, Hoibier gets it under control,
[6277.72 - 6282.72] P:1702.64 E:0.108458 |  passes it to the right-hand side, this is where Alexander Barr is chasing,
[6282.72 - 6285.72] P:1822.04 E:0.100330 |  but he won't reach that, and it's out of play,
[6285.72 - 6288.72] P:1800.62 E:0.097397 |  and it's a throwing to England.
[6290.72 - 6295.72] P:1662.40 E:0.101707 |  It's been a torrid experience to Garos Southgate and England.
[6295.72 - 6298.72] P:1905.63 E:0.107595 |  I mean, Declan Rice, I'm looking at his body,
[6298.72 - 6302.72] P:1965.33 E:0.105961 |  normally you see Declan Rice, he's got that kind of strut about him,
[6302.72 - 6306.72] P:1965.75 E:0.113622 |  he looks exhausted, and I think he's having to get around the pitch,
[6306.72 - 6310.72] P:1990.79 E:0.112331 |  I think there's space all around him, he's putting in so much work,
[6310.72 - 6314.72] P:1758.02 E:0.097685 |  but getting very little reward in terms of interceptions, challenges,
[6314.72 - 6317.72] P:1635.62 E:0.115923 |  he's just probably feeling his one or two yards off everyone all the time.
[6317.72 - 6320.72] P:1559.59 E:0.103915 |  Oh, as he passes it infield, very nearly given a pulse,
[6320.72 - 6323.72] P:1709.59 E:0.108137 |  and now Gallagher, who's hauled all back, that's a free kick,
[6323.72 - 6326.72] P:1764.71 E:0.106893 |  Christian Norgaard, yellow carded for that,
[6326.72 - 6331.72] P:1687.81 E:0.103695 |  yellow card for the number 15, and England free kick,
[6331.72 - 6333.72] P:1718.12 E:0.109543 |  and that's very welcome.
[6333.72 - 6337.72] P:1471.85 E:0.109316 |  Now any breather, any chance to break up the play,
[6337.72 - 6340.72] P:1607.76 E:0.111117 |  Stones out to the far side, Denmark singing their songs,
[6340.72 - 6344.72] P:1514.51 E:0.113976 |  he has borne, goes on a run, but is easily dispossessed by Hoipje,
[6344.72 - 6349.72] P:1540.41 E:0.109932 |  now Paulson, Paulson then back into the back line to Joachim Anderson.
[6349.72 - 6355.72] P:1870.35 E:0.115716 |  Sun comes brightly out again through the gaps between the stand and the roof,
[6355.72 - 6361.72] P:1816.37 E:0.109327 |  and Denmark with three minutes to play, and the score still level at 1-1.
[6361.72 - 6366.72] P:1662.19 E:0.113772 |  We'll bring you the interviews, we'll bring them live if we can before Spain, Italy,
[6366.72 - 6371.72] P:1663.47 E:0.102262 |  otherwise you'll hear them later, or on the football daily at the Euros,
[6371.72 - 6377.72] P:1535.36 E:0.097417 |  which will be available for you from BBC Sounds in the morning from the usual places.
[6377.72 - 6383.72] P:1554.19 E:0.097848 |  But Denmark with the ball with their three central defenders,
[6383.72 - 6386.72] P:1523.98 E:0.113819 |  Casper Hulman making that little change that we saw,
[6386.72 - 6389.72] P:1602.57 E:0.105926 |  the change of position for the central defenders,
[6389.72 - 6393.72] P:1731.34 E:0.113816 |  it's been a savvy performance from Denmark and Casper Hulman,
[6393.72 - 6397.72] P:1699.45 E:0.107712 |  as the ball is England's for a free kick on the Conegalliga.
[6397.72 - 6400.72] P:1712.58 E:0.109804 |  It's interesting the two centre backs have switched,
[6400.72 - 6403.72] P:1624.32 E:0.108620 |  I think since Saka went off, Christensen's gone into the middle,
[6403.72 - 6407.72] P:1597.98 E:0.103639 |  Investigard is on the left-hand side of the back three,
[6407.72 - 6413.72] P:1686.99 E:0.117327 |  in terms of game plan and tactically, and togetherness they've had,
[6413.72 - 6417.72] P:1676.31 E:0.111475 |  it's been very good from Denmark, they've given a good account of themselves,
[6417.72 - 6419.72] P:1785.06 E:0.108298 |  they're very difficult for England.
[6419.72 - 6422.72] P:1885.02 E:0.110454 |  All Danish fans, and I'm sure many other Danish players as well,
[6422.72 - 6425.72] P:1917.40 E:0.114835 |  really upset about the way things went against them,
[6425.72 - 6430.72] P:1953.53 E:0.114707 |  but Wembley and the semi-finals, they've really given England a fright here.
[6430.72 - 6433.72] P:1830.22 E:0.107111 |  Walker now from the free kick, goes for a long pass now,
[6433.72 - 6439.72] P:1808.39 E:0.119953 |  that's got way too much on it, cheers from the Danish fans who are mocking England really.
[6439.72 - 6442.72] P:1820.40 E:0.098785 |  I can understand, which set plays like that,
[6442.72 - 6445.72] P:1766.21 E:0.102209 |  I mean it's pretty basic, isn't it?
[6445.72 - 6451.72] P:1716.13 E:0.104453 |  Just roll it right and the ball in, it's not been great in quality,
[6451.72 - 6454.72] P:1631.28 E:0.104906 |  has it, from England, you have to say that, but we're still in it,
[6454.72 - 6458.72] P:1724.96 E:0.101893 |  scrapping away, you have to try and take a positive from that sense,
[6458.72 - 6463.72] P:1597.61 E:0.106440 |  it's 1-1, but performance-wise it's not been up to scratch.
[6463.72 - 6467.72] P:1546.24 E:0.105072 |  This is absolutely, you know, confidence, look shot,
[6467.72 - 6469.72] P:1615.39 E:0.101153 |  as the ball comes forward off the head of Paulson,
[6469.72 - 6472.72] P:1679.46 E:0.109771 |  all the way through to Jordan Pickford.
[6472.72 - 6475.72] P:1836.50 E:0.119235 |  So there will be all of the questions, what is it, why is this,
[6475.72 - 6479.72] P:1805.60 E:0.116600 |  where are they, they'll talk about the leaders as well,
[6479.72 - 6482.72] P:1536.17 E:0.104426 |  and whether there's enough of that out on the pitch,
[6482.72 - 6487.72] P:1564.43 E:0.111806 |  as Stones passes the ball here, and it's played in field by Trippia,
[6487.72 - 6495.72] P:1493.82 E:0.108165 |  Eze, and then Declan Rice, Gale passes it back along the six-yard area to Pickford,
[6495.72 - 6499.72] P:1693.78 E:0.103750 |  they don't go long, they go to Stones, and then it's passed out to Gallagher,
[6499.72 - 6502.72] P:1632.95 E:0.104591 |  who's inside the penalty area, then back to Walker,
[6502.72 - 6507.72] P:1855.35 E:0.110252 |  Denmark pressing England back, and Stones fortunate as able to win a throw-in,
[6507.72 - 6513.72] P:1892.43 E:0.106539 |  fire a deflection, and it feels like, like a cat on a hot tin roof for England.
[6513.72 - 6517.72] P:1703.53 E:0.092579 |  Yeah, but I also think Denmark can sense that there's a mistake there,
[6517.72 - 6520.72] P:1806.05 E:0.098401 |  something's coming, they're just going all the way out, the moment it goes short.
[6520.72 - 6522.72] P:1803.02 E:0.102098 |  Never mind Denmark, I think I can...
[6522.72 - 6525.72] P:1934.22 E:0.109593 |  Yeah, I know, I think we're all sat here, I'm just looking to my left and my right,
[6525.72 - 6530.72] P:1839.37 E:0.106229 |  we're all a little bit edgy, everyone's, you know, the raised eyes to everyone,
[6530.72 - 6535.72] P:1845.83 E:0.110631 |  like, what's going on, but we just don't look comfortable having the ball in that part of the pitch.
[6535.72 - 6538.72] P:1837.04 E:0.105828 |  As they win the free kick off his club mate, Joachim Anderson,
[6538.72 - 6543.72] P:1721.96 E:0.098804 |  arm on his shoulder as they went down, Anderson, they'll talk about that next season,
[6543.72 - 6546.72] P:1744.01 E:0.108329 |  free kick taken by England, and we ironed out a time now,
[6546.72 - 6548.72] P:1724.87 E:0.114953 |  there were just three minutes with a blessed relief for England,
[6548.72 - 6553.72] P:1846.48 E:0.108978 |  and they're all getting it, Bellingham is dispossessed,
[6553.72 - 6557.72] P:1867.08 E:0.104176 |  but he was fouled, says referee, Arte Suarez, he has a free kick,
[6557.72 - 6562.72] P:1802.50 E:0.097407 |  and of course there will be discussion as well about what's happened to Bellingham tonight,
[6562.72 - 6565.72] P:1802.60 E:0.094122 |  just flashes of what he can do.
[6565.72 - 6567.72] P:1689.85 E:0.093143 |  Yeah, he hasn't been able to get in the game,
[6567.72 - 6571.72] P:1904.38 E:0.110656 |  and then because it's so disjointed in terms of the structure and where he's without the ball,
[6571.72 - 6576.72] P:2006.40 E:0.118498 |  he's not really been able to play the role out of possession that he probably needs to,
[6576.72 - 6583.72] P:1963.75 E:0.110072 |  everything's stretched, everything's tight and organised and assured, it's been very open.
[6583.72 - 6587.72] P:1905.16 E:0.111670 |  One-one in added time, England taking an edge over the taking of this free kick,
[6587.72 - 6592.72] P:1804.79 E:0.104541 |  and are dangerously flirting by the yellow card there for Pickford who does eventually take it,
[6592.72 - 6598.72] P:1888.65 E:0.118688 |  and then there's a foul on Gae by Paulson, the Danish fans are absolutely furious about that,
[6598.72 - 6602.72] P:1877.89 E:0.103540 |  Stones wanted to take a quick one, but the referee says no, I'm not ready for that,
[6602.72 - 6608.72] P:1846.78 E:0.096489 |  I'm going to bring it back for a free kick, and Paulson again gets to his feet and says,
[6608.72 - 6612.72] P:1808.07 E:0.107770 |  I've only been on the field a few minutes, and you've not given me anything.
[6612.72 - 6615.72] P:1889.95 E:0.104163 |  Yeah, but in fairness, he's trying to step across the path of Mark Gehr,
[6615.72 - 6619.72] P:1833.15 E:0.103599 |  who's coming on to attack the ball, and he's had a whack on the side of his knee,
[6619.72 - 6621.72] P:1795.91 E:0.108271 |  because Gehr, his knee went right into the side of his thigh,
[6621.72 - 6624.72] P:1906.04 E:0.102429 |  but you can't just step across the path of the player going to head it,
[6624.72 - 6627.72] P:1903.18 E:0.095920 |  you're going to get clattered, and that's what happened.
[6627.72 - 6632.72] P:1856.50 E:0.106664 |  Free kick then for England, in added time, 90 seconds of the added time to go.
[6632.72 - 6641.72] P:1744.13 E:0.100873 |  They get a goal out of this and win the match, and that would be such an escape for England.
[6641.72 - 6645.72] P:1885.91 E:0.120089 |  But the free kick is easily headed away on the edge of the Danish area,
[6645.72 - 6650.72] P:1909.12 E:0.108453 |  comes back to Pickford in his own half, he goes long, left footed, looking for Bourne on the far side,
[6650.72 - 6654.72] P:1685.22 E:0.102889 |  that's headed down though for Denmark, and then Gallagher into the challenge,
[6654.72 - 6662.72] P:1825.22 E:0.100181 |  loses out to Mala, Denmark, cleared across the back line to Joakim Andersen.
[6662.72 - 6667.72] P:1730.88 E:0.100532 |  Now, bar, long ball from bar, Trippier's underneath it, Trippier goes down,
[6667.72 - 6674.72] P:1875.82 E:0.110387 |  he gets the free kick for the shove by Skål Olsen, and he stays flat on his face here in Trippier,
[6674.72 - 6678.72] P:1920.44 E:0.104342 |  and Decklin Rice says to Gehr, don't take it yet, that's where they are.
[6678.72 - 6682.72] P:1913.06 E:0.107098 |  Yeah, just slow down, little shove in the back of Trippier, wins the foul,
[6682.72 - 6690.72] P:1897.31 E:0.097138 |  just take the sting out of it, slow it down a little bit, we're just in possession now with John Stones.
[6690.72 - 6696.72] P:1851.08 E:0.105595 |  And so England eventually do take the free kick, with less than 30 seconds of added time to go,
[6696.72 - 6700.72] P:1821.51 E:0.103131 |  they pass back to Pickford, who retreats into his area, and clears it,
[6700.72 - 6703.72] P:1560.23 E:0.105989 |  left footed with Tolsen closing him down, comes through the middle to Watkins,
[6703.72 - 6707.72] P:1727.25 E:0.106568 |  then Bellingham who scores so many late goals for Real Madrid this season,
[6707.72 - 6713.72] P:1812.27 E:0.110325 |  as they enter the penalty area, as they play it across, almost reaches Bourne on the edge of the box,
[6713.72 - 6719.72] P:1795.79 E:0.102178 |  Mailer just got there first, exactly, might just now open up for England in the final 30 seconds,
[6719.72 - 6722.72] P:1850.94 E:0.099798 |  as it's chipped by Stones to the far side, Walker back to Stones,
[6722.72 - 6728.72] P:1928.69 E:0.107501 |  I'll make it the three minutes are up now, referee says that's it, final whistle,
[6728.72 - 6734.72] P:1896.75 E:0.115841 |  and listen to this reaction from the England supporters, listen to this,
[6734.72 - 6738.72] P:1769.82 E:0.113932 |  whistles and cheers and booze all around the stadium here in Frankfurt,
[6738.72 - 6742.72] P:1844.52 E:0.104097 |  that has been a torrid match for Garoselle, in his team,
[6742.72 - 6748.72] P:1850.82 E:0.105878 |  England players drop down, Trippier's on his back, Rice goes down onto his haunches,
[6748.72 - 6753.72] P:1854.23 E:0.104347 |  Walker down there, he's having a stretch, what a night this was,
[6753.72 - 6758.72] P:1864.39 E:0.106586 |  from such a high of Harry Kane giving England the lead in the 18th minute,
[6758.72 - 6764.72] P:1848.96 E:0.110074 |  but from that point on, Denmark took over, and England have been all over the place at times,
[6764.72 - 6768.72] P:1829.84 E:0.114694 |  Real Madrid equalising with a very good goal, ten minutes before the break,
[6768.72 - 6771.72] P:1780.01 E:0.106229 |  but somehow they've got out of that with a point.
[6771.72 - 6775.72] P:1904.56 E:0.111884 |  The play before that goal, John, was pretty steady from England, wasn't it,
[6775.72 - 6778.72] P:1853.72 E:0.095432 |  we were knocking the ball around, looking confident, OK Denmark,
[6778.72 - 6781.72] P:1853.66 E:0.109016 |  maybe we're feeling their way into it, but the moment they did,
[6781.72 - 6787.72] P:1862.75 E:0.100484 |  and that goal was a reaction point, they all of a sudden kicked in Denmark and lost a bit of fear,
[6787.72 - 6790.72] P:1924.90 E:0.102745 |  we've got one goal down, right, let's start to play our game,
[6790.72 - 6793.72] P:1918.04 E:0.108121 |  and we could get to grips with it, didn't get hold of the ball,
[6793.72 - 6796.72] P:1941.31 E:0.099137 |  didn't cope with the amount of possession, couldn't apply pressure,
[6796.72 - 6801.72] P:1903.60 E:0.111260 |  we looked disjointed in the midfield, and that really is the catalyst to a lot of the problem,
[6801.72 - 6806.72] P:1891.69 E:0.100564 |  but it was a disappointing performance, there's absolutely no doubt in that,
[6806.72 - 6811.72] P:1968.68 E:0.104442 |  but we get away with it, with a 1-1 draw, it's a point, you move on to the next game,
[6811.72 - 6814.72] P:1886.33 E:0.107013 |  you regroup, it's tournament football, is it great at the moment,
[6814.72 - 6818.72] P:1902.75 E:0.112449 |  are England on a good run of form, no we're not, we're not playing that well.
[6818.72 - 6821.72] P:1853.66 E:0.116570 |  They simply do not look as though they're building into this tournament,
[6821.72 - 6824.72] P:1862.06 E:0.112987 |  they look as though they're going the other way, and there we are,
[6824.72 - 6828.72] P:1926.75 E:0.115520 |  Denmark won, England won, and the England players going to the England fans,
[6828.72 - 6832.72] P:1954.40 E:0.110048 |  those of whom are still in the stadium, Mark.
[6832.72 - 6836.72] P:1851.84 E:0.118825 |  That was actually going to be my point to easy Christmas to these touch lines,
[6836.72 - 6839.72] P:1881.52 E:0.112009 |  but first of all, are you going down to do interviews?
[6839.72 - 6843.72] P:1949.28 E:0.122235 |  Yes, I am, all right, nothing, nothing to particularly work on the radio,
[6843.72 - 6846.72] P:1895.49 E:0.123823 |  you'd have thought in all of my years.
[6846.72 - 6850.72] P:1965.68 E:0.109314 |  I mean, there'll be an interesting point here, John,
[6850.72 - 6853.72] P:1967.52 E:0.112316 |  because I guess some of them will talk about the pitch,
[6853.72 - 6857.72] P:1971.44 E:0.114001 |  but it was the same for both teams, same for both teams,
[6857.72 - 6861.72] P:1926.47 E:0.109346 |  and you know, the professional players corner, you know,
[6861.72 - 6865.72] P:1956.84 E:0.124133 |  they're not going to use that as an excuse, there's no dressing up.
[6865.72 - 6867.72] P:1936.02 E:0.119514 |  They will mention something about it.
[6867.72 - 6869.72] P:2039.94 E:0.106886 |  Well, they will, which they are entitled to do.
[6869.72 - 6873.72] P:1959.17 E:0.118031 |  Yeah, you can't mention the pitch, it's nothing to do with the pitch,
[6873.72 - 6875.72] P:1881.50 E:0.120818 |  you can talk about the pitch if you want,
[6875.72 - 6878.72] P:1880.45 E:0.118327 |  I think it's more looking and dissecting and looking in the mirror,
[6878.72 - 6880.72] P:1876.12 E:0.113876 |  wearing them out at the minute.
[6880.72 - 6883.72] P:1874.01 E:0.118763 |  I actually think we look a little bit tired, if I'm being honest with you,
[6883.72 - 6885.72] P:1925.75 E:0.111694 |  I think we look a little bit lethargic, I think we look,
[6885.72 - 6887.72] P:1789.35 E:0.113148 |  and it's full-closed to Denmark by the way,
[6887.72 - 6889.72] P:1931.37 E:0.120933 |  they came and put on a performance,
[6889.72 - 6892.72] P:1858.45 E:0.114353 |  but I just think we look a little bit leggy at this moment in time in England.
[6892.72 - 6894.72] P:1797.61 E:0.124066 |  I'm going to go down pitch side to easy,
[6894.72 - 6898.72] P:1835.71 E:0.120190 |  because the first thing I noticed was you look behind you,
[6898.72 - 6904.72] P:1803.90 E:0.116975 |  they have stayed to a man, woman and child in the Danish end,
[6904.72 - 6907.72] P:1846.98 E:0.110636 |  the English end is half empty.
[6907.72 - 6910.72] P:1848.52 E:0.114946 |  Yeah, that is the start contrast, isn't it, Chappers?
[6910.72 - 6914.72] P:1858.92 E:0.114677 |  I think these Danish fans have absolutely loved that performance from their team,
[6914.72 - 6917.72] P:1941.13 E:0.103835 |  it was full of heart grit, they looked sharp,
[6917.72 - 6919.72] P:1910.06 E:0.111776 |  they were fizzing the ball around the pitch,
[6919.72 - 6922.72] P:1950.32 E:0.115820 |  and I thought they were more street-wise than England, I really do,
[6922.72 - 6925.72] P:1994.47 E:0.110594 |  I think they were smart in the way they played out of pressure,
[6925.72 - 6928.72] P:1996.81 E:0.108648 |  and I think that England team, I think the biggest thing that stands out to me
[6928.72 - 6931.72] P:1974.08 E:0.109174 |  is the body language, they looked ejected,
[6931.72 - 6934.72] P:1858.85 E:0.116976 |  as soon as the full-time whistle went, Cure and Trippier fell onto the floor,
[6934.72 - 6937.72] P:1838.53 E:0.121885 |  you had to lie down, players would fall into their knees,
[6937.72 - 6939.72] P:1888.04 E:0.123153 |  the fans are going like you say,
[6939.72 - 6941.72] P:1823.05 E:0.118031 |  and it just seems to be a very weird atmosphere,
[6941.72 - 6945.72] P:1856.76 E:0.117308 |  so it's up to the staff, the substitutes on that bench now for England
[6945.72 - 6947.72] P:1940.01 E:0.119276 |  to pick the team right back up again,
[6947.72 - 6950.72] P:1862.23 E:0.117190 |  because Torna Malfoy-Fubble is all about momentum as we know.
[6950.72 - 6954.72] P:1847.62 E:0.119813 |  I had to say that, I was thinking the same thing,
[6954.72 - 6959.72] P:1898.67 E:0.113536 |  I thought the body language at times was awful, really,
[6959.72 - 6962.72] P:1869.38 E:0.114740 |  I don't know whether they are tired,
[6962.72 - 6965.72] P:1875.96 E:0.116141 |  but there was a lot of shrugging pointing.
[6967.72 - 6971.72] P:1809.13 E:0.116979 |  I've not watched England with an energetic performance for a while, though,
[6971.72 - 6977.72] P:1701.61 E:0.111589 |  which I will say, this isn't something that's come to the table recently,
[6977.72 - 6980.72] P:1735.48 E:0.112960 |  I think building into the March fixtures,
[6980.72 - 6983.72] P:1771.65 E:0.111154 |  certainly the Iceland game, the Serbia game,
[6983.72 - 6987.72] P:1803.03 E:0.114282 |  the worry of it for me is that we've looked quite leggy, relatively early on in the game,
[6987.72 - 6990.72] P:1855.22 E:0.117161 |  it's not just the last 10 minutes where we look tired,
[6990.72 - 6994.72] P:1802.00 E:0.114161 |  I think the movement off the ball, the energy to get away and make space,
[6994.72 - 6997.72] P:1565.05 E:0.121905 |  and then obviously you then adjust in again when the ball turns over,
[6997.72 - 7000.72] P:1647.64 E:0.118300 |  that coming in to going out and up and down and getting the line up,
[7000.72 - 7004.72] P:1746.48 E:0.117265 |  condensing the pitch, then making it bigger, it's a massive amount of work,
[7004.72 - 7007.72] P:1780.68 E:0.113056 |  and we just don't look like we've quite got that energy enough.
[7007.72 - 7009.72] P:1762.00 E:0.113720 |  No, it's been on the pitch.
[7009.72 - 7011.72] P:1813.67 E:0.118784 |  I'm starting to think of the game.
[7011.72 - 7015.72] P:1853.32 E:0.113634 |  Before I go, on the pitch, it's been an issue, hasn't it?
[7015.72 - 7019.72] P:1733.39 E:0.123968 |  The games in March, the performance against Brazil for the most part,
[7019.72 - 7021.72] P:1781.21 E:0.122656 |  part of the Belgian game.
[7021.72 - 7022.72] P:1855.89 E:0.110108 |  Did you feel that?
[7022.72 - 7024.72] P:1801.24 E:0.125452 |  And then into the games, in tune before the tournament,
[7024.72 - 7026.72] P:1864.13 E:0.116269 |  the first half against Bosnia Herzegovina,
[7026.72 - 7028.72] P:1831.22 E:0.119025 |  the whole thing against Iceland,
[7028.72 - 7030.72] P:1773.73 E:0.118383 |  the second half against Serbia,
[7030.72 - 7035.72] P:1845.85 E:0.119890 |  and that's the worry that it's not absolutely coming out of the blue.
[7035.72 - 7036.72] P:2002.94 E:0.099359 |  No.
[7037.72 - 7040.72] P:1806.16 E:0.123444 |  I also think it's affected us knowing we get on the ball then,
[7040.72 - 7042.72] P:1769.61 E:0.119718 |  so it's draining a little bit of confidence.
[7042.72 - 7044.72] P:1595.34 E:0.116614 |  There's an opportunity in the first half, I think,
[7044.72 - 7046.72] P:1598.82 E:0.112325 |  I think, to the Shepherds when Trent could have played forward,
[7046.72 - 7048.72] P:1832.62 E:0.117512 |  and that one he could have played forward,
[7048.72 - 7050.72] P:1883.48 E:0.116118 |  and we just take the easy pass backwards,
[7050.72 - 7053.72] P:1928.61 E:0.114541 |  and the team, again, Mark, where he's sitting that low block,
[7053.72 - 7056.72] P:1875.15 E:0.116563 |  and they're comfortable, and the stop players coming through,
[7056.72 - 7058.72] P:1883.48 E:0.113614 |  it suits them, and adjusting that to equal into our game,
[7058.72 - 7060.72] P:1615.79 E:0.118883 |  a little bit just turning down, playing forward.
[7060.72 - 7062.72] P:1807.33 E:0.104254 |  But also, once it started to go,
[7062.72 - 7065.72] P:1869.19 E:0.110751 |  then towards into the second half,
[7065.72 - 7067.72] P:1852.59 E:0.123503 |  it looked like somebody put a hoover,
[7067.72 - 7069.72] P:1796.11 E:0.105318 |  and was sucking confidence out of the players.
[7069.72 - 7071.72] P:1886.99 E:0.113455 |  Whenever Pickford had the ball to have it short,
[7071.72 - 7073.72] P:1969.44 E:0.104997 |  it was just not an option.
[7073.72 - 7076.72] P:1877.47 E:0.107762 |  Jordan Pickford made good decisions just to go long.
[7076.72 - 7079.72] P:1862.94 E:0.114144 |  One of the things, is that, I mean, I thought that,
[7079.72 - 7081.72] P:1763.18 E:0.121641 |  I mean, in all of this,
[7081.72 - 7084.72] P:1753.93 E:0.117862 |  Denmark deserve a massive amount of praise here.
[7084.72 - 7087.72] P:1787.54 E:0.110819 |  We are obviously looking from an English point of view.
[7087.72 - 7089.72] P:1766.79 E:0.120674 |  Denmark, both in and out of possession,
[7089.72 - 7091.72] P:1800.31 E:0.111600 |  I thought were brilliant today,
[7091.72 - 7093.72] P:1870.74 E:0.105930 |  and England fans might go,
[7093.72 - 7096.72] P:1776.18 E:0.117836 |  it's only been a draw, and England have got four points.
[7096.72 - 7098.72] P:1759.35 E:0.102871 |  But what I noticed with Denmark,
[7098.72 - 7100.72] P:1744.39 E:0.109998 |  where they're in or out of possession,
[7100.72 - 7104.72] P:1663.07 E:0.109835 |  they always knew where they had to be for their teammate.
[7104.72 - 7107.72] P:1762.47 E:0.111108 |  There was a lot of pointing, there was a lot of directing,
[7107.72 - 7109.72] P:1874.66 E:0.119727 |  there was a lot of cajoling.
[7109.72 - 7111.72] P:1817.18 E:0.115843 |  They always knew where they needed to be.
[7111.72 - 7114.72] P:1703.49 E:0.102806 |  Yeah, and I've always thought that being a player,
[7114.72 - 7117.72] P:1818.69 E:0.109494 |  the biggest thing you need is role clarity.
[7117.72 - 7119.72] P:1733.97 E:0.116910 |  And Conor said it at the end of the first half,
[7119.72 - 7122.72] P:1764.23 E:0.112395 |  that they've been playing this system for a long time,
[7122.72 - 7125.72] P:1862.09 E:0.108621 |  three at the back, five across the middle, and two up front.
[7125.72 - 7127.72] P:1796.98 E:0.119337 |  That changes, it looks different during the game.
[7127.72 - 7130.72] P:1779.59 E:0.103927 |  But fundamentally, they play with a three back.
[7130.72 - 7131.72] P:1485.31 E:0.127898 |  Everyone knows their roles,
[7131.72 - 7133.72] P:1725.09 E:0.113683 |  and you look at those three centre-backs for Denmark,
[7133.72 - 7135.72] P:1763.81 E:0.105822 |  and you're like, none of them are rapid,
[7135.72 - 7138.72] P:1703.97 E:0.113247 |  none of them are very good at coming into the ball,
[7138.72 - 7140.72] P:1724.38 E:0.109697 |  none of them are exceptional at playing out from the back
[7140.72 - 7141.72] P:1824.02 E:0.089318 |  when they've got the ball,
[7141.72 - 7144.72] P:1829.00 E:0.112908 |  but what they do is they work as a team, they work as a unit.
[7144.72 - 7146.72] P:1793.94 E:0.121495 |  And I think that was the difference between the two teams,
[7146.72 - 7148.72] P:1836.76 E:0.102829 |  and I just think that the intelligence
[7148.72 - 7150.72] P:1696.49 E:0.108804 |  and the balance that they've got in that team,
[7150.72 - 7153.72] P:1783.65 E:0.111603 |  between Ericsson and the midfield and the forwards,
[7153.72 - 7154.72] P:2007.74 E:0.089531 |  it just works.
[7154.72 - 7156.72] P:1743.16 E:0.110158 |  And sometimes when you've played a system,
[7156.72 - 7158.72] P:1580.05 E:0.118995 |  the same system for a long period of time,
[7158.72 - 7160.72] P:1789.80 E:0.100999 |  and you've got the players that buy into that,
[7160.72 - 7162.72] P:1784.88 E:0.107633 |  it helps and it works.
[7162.72 - 7164.72] P:1742.21 E:0.113018 |  And Denmark and their team come on away from this match
[7164.72 - 7165.72] P:1760.45 E:0.113797 |  this evening with momentum.
[7165.72 - 7167.72] P:1760.81 E:0.107346 |  That back three, Conor.
[7167.72 - 7169.72] P:1780.68 E:0.111179 |  They knew when to step into midfield,
[7169.72 - 7171.72] P:1790.64 E:0.101269 |  if they had to go and pick someone up,
[7171.72 - 7173.72] P:1737.32 E:0.108835 |  pick them into the inside channel.
[7173.72 - 7175.72] P:1766.28 E:0.107118 |  They knew when to hold their line,
[7175.72 - 7176.72] P:1784.36 E:0.101906 |  and in front of them,
[7176.72 - 7178.72] P:1776.55 E:0.110462 |  we said it to each other during the second half.
[7178.72 - 7181.72] P:1761.60 E:0.104270 |  I thought Hoiber was absolutely immense.
[7181.72 - 7182.72] P:1663.49 E:0.110664 |  It was fantastic.
[7182.72 - 7185.72] P:1813.38 E:0.110484 |  It was fantastic, but we spoke about before the game,
[7185.72 - 7187.72] P:1866.42 E:0.100499 |  a matter about getting the ball to Sacher
[7187.72 - 7189.72] P:1852.28 E:0.097999 |  and trying to hit in that channel.
[7189.72 - 7191.72] P:1768.63 E:0.106472 |  I can't remember the time that we've done that, Matt.
[7191.72 - 7193.72] P:1782.62 E:0.111963 |  I can't remember the time where we pulled out Sensorbacks,
[7193.72 - 7195.72] P:1764.38 E:0.110641 |  places where we don't want to be a Sensorback,
[7195.72 - 7197.72] P:1707.31 E:0.097055 |  we don't want to be on a touch line defending,
[7197.72 - 7199.72] P:1737.36 E:0.106240 |  and I can't remember the time England done that,
[7199.72 - 7201.72] P:1735.92 E:0.103103 |  but like you said, great credit to Denmark.
[7201.72 - 7203.72] P:1739.77 E:0.108335 |  They step up the pit, they're aggressive when they need to be aggressive.
[7203.72 - 7206.72] P:1747.42 E:0.105279 |  But what gets me in that formation is how comfortable you can be.
[7206.72 - 7209.72] P:1791.75 E:0.108921 |  In the mid-block, when the other teams got the ball and say,
[7209.72 - 7211.72] P:1730.95 E:0.105913 |  OK, then, come and beat us and let's see what you do.
[7211.72 - 7214.72] P:1673.47 E:0.104745 |  They're not thinking about fundamentals there, though, Conor.
[7214.72 - 7216.72] P:1797.62 E:0.102334 |  If you're going to get the ball out to Sacher,
[7216.72 - 7219.72] P:1791.29 E:0.102296 |  you've got a fast, quick ball that's crisp,
[7219.72 - 7222.72] P:1727.41 E:0.101728 |  that's banged, that has tempo and it has energy,
[7222.72 - 7225.72] P:1753.82 E:0.100557 |  and you're driving that out there, and it's a collect...
[7225.72 - 7228.72] P:1830.88 E:0.094287 |  It never felt like that from...
[7228.72 - 7230.72] P:1814.44 E:0.109065 |  Right from the off. Yes, we had some control possession,
[7230.72 - 7233.72] P:1672.30 E:0.089569 |  but it wasn't that progressive, aggressive stuff,
[7233.72 - 7236.72] P:1667.71 E:0.103568 |  and then we're waiting on somebody to do something individually.
[7236.72 - 7239.72] P:1772.21 E:0.099240 |  And then I think if that doesn't happen, you're in trouble
[7239.72 - 7241.72] P:1720.24 E:0.110586 |  and you get a performance like what we can.
[7241.72 - 7243.72] P:1749.00 E:0.106082 |  Well, when Ezzer came on, is he?
[7243.72 - 7247.72] P:1768.45 E:0.108775 |  I don't think he touched the ball till we got to second half stop beside him,
[7247.72 - 7250.72] P:1867.80 E:0.101863 |  and you sort of think, well, just go on,
[7250.72 - 7252.72] P:1787.02 E:0.111964 |  try going in the inside forward line,
[7252.72 - 7255.72] P:1736.14 E:0.107094 |  and someone get the ball to him and see what you can do,
[7255.72 - 7257.72] P:1783.89 E:0.109045 |  but they never got the ball to him.
[7257.72 - 7260.72] P:1790.21 E:0.101783 |  Well, they didn't because of the height of the back line of Denmark
[7260.72 - 7263.72] P:1839.91 E:0.111971 |  and the space in between them and the midfield.
[7263.72 - 7266.72] P:1804.54 E:0.110983 |  The three players that came on, Bowen, Watkins and Ezzer,
[7266.72 - 7269.72] P:1904.29 E:0.105600 |  they just weren't able to get a foothold in the game
[7269.72 - 7271.72] P:1770.49 E:0.114935 |  and to find and feel the rhythm of the match,
[7271.72 - 7273.72] P:1902.12 E:0.110189 |  because Denmark was so intelligent.
[7273.72 - 7277.72] P:1827.78 E:0.114776 |  It was Andersen, wasn't it, his club teammate up against him from Crystal Palace.
[7277.72 - 7281.72] P:1897.26 E:0.112383 |  As he came on, Andersen kind of had that assurance around his body language,
[7281.72 - 7283.72] P:1912.82 E:0.115088 |  I'll do with this, he's a good player, Ezzer,
[7283.72 - 7285.72] P:1824.60 E:0.112478 |  but he just didn't get a sniff in the game.
[7285.72 - 7287.72] P:1800.84 E:0.106197 |  A couple of times, Olly Watkins ran the channels,
[7287.72 - 7289.72] P:1858.19 E:0.112631 |  but the ball drifted out of play,
[7289.72 - 7291.72] P:1957.52 E:0.102417 |  and they just didn't quite work.
[7291.72 - 7294.72] P:1749.48 E:0.107803 |  That's where England got to think outside the box a little bit and go,
[7294.72 - 7297.72] P:1713.05 E:0.110815 |  if there's no space in behind, we've got to play around them,
[7297.72 - 7299.72] P:1751.36 E:0.117598 |  and that's where Connors are alluding to,
[7299.72 - 7301.72] P:1911.63 E:0.113325 |  we're getting the ball out to Saka quickly,
[7301.72 - 7304.72] P:1769.73 E:0.103551 |  getting midfielders around him to combine and suck players out of their shape.
[7304.72 - 7307.72] P:1833.11 E:0.123395 |  But fundamentally, listen, we've got to sit here and give massive credit to Denmark.
[7307.72 - 7310.72] P:1937.00 E:0.117024 |  That was an unbelievable performance from them.
[7310.72 - 7313.72] P:1969.13 E:0.121382 |  If you're in this England camp now,
[7316.72 - 7318.72] P:1926.83 E:0.114400 |  you know what's coming.
[7318.72 - 7320.72] P:1788.14 E:0.116303 |  I know they shut the noise out and all of that,
[7320.72 - 7325.72] P:1889.90 E:0.109943 |  and maybe they'll be honest about how they feel they've performed tonight.
[7325.72 - 7328.72] P:1841.83 E:0.101523 |  But somehow you have to focus on four points
[7328.72 - 7330.72] P:1835.67 E:0.102073 |  on top of the group,
[7330.72 - 7334.72] P:1820.16 E:0.105381 |  and kind of park this, don't you?
[7334.72 - 7336.72] P:1707.63 E:0.107455 |  It's for us to dissect it.
[7336.72 - 7339.72] P:1798.74 E:0.110413 |  They partly need to park it.
[7339.72 - 7341.72] P:1927.17 E:0.112039 |  Yeah, without a doubt, but what Olly will say is they'll debrief it,
[7341.72 - 7344.72] P:1913.72 E:0.115439 |  they'll go over it because that's the best way to lay in for them.
[7344.72 - 7346.72] P:1834.68 E:0.111045 |  And you've got to lay in for them.
[7346.72 - 7348.72] P:1863.84 E:0.117733 |  There are a lot of players who play on the biggest stage,
[7348.72 - 7350.72] P:1904.30 E:0.105264 |  there are a lot of players in that squad on that pitch tonight
[7350.72 - 7352.72] P:1841.39 E:0.119580 |  who played at this stage numerous times
[7352.72 - 7354.72] P:1835.37 E:0.115106 |  and will understand the feeling of what they're going through,
[7354.72 - 7356.72] P:1910.56 E:0.113537 |  they'll understand the feeling of the supporters,
[7356.72 - 7358.72] P:1882.45 E:0.113933 |  and what Olly will say is he will debrief it,
[7358.72 - 7360.72] P:1949.75 E:0.112322 |  that's something that Garry Salke is always good with his team.
[7360.72 - 7362.72] P:1923.66 E:0.119434 |  But one thing that you've got to do, you've got to look at the group
[7362.72 - 7365.72] P:1953.04 E:0.108104 |  and go right, we're on four points, we can only get better,
[7365.72 - 7368.72] P:1905.50 E:0.112528 |  we have to get better to get anywhere near winning this tournament,
[7368.72 - 7371.72] P:1864.70 E:0.109008 |  we have to get better, and that's all part of debriefing the game
[7371.72 - 7373.72] P:1912.72 E:0.112115 |  and learning and improving.
[7373.72 - 7376.72] P:1956.59 E:0.102488 |  It's a good moment, and it's not just happened.
[7376.72 - 7384.72] P:1953.94 E:0.109667 |  It's been a steady thing, and to get four points playing badly in two games,
[7384.72 - 7388.72] P:1890.60 E:0.107619 |  you've got to step back and go, well hold on a minute, we're not bad then,
[7388.72 - 7391.72] P:1878.88 E:0.112830 |  in terms of we've got some talent or we've got some robustness
[7391.72 - 7395.72] P:1835.32 E:0.114718 |  or we've got some togetherness or we'll defend and we'll scrap it out
[7395.72 - 7397.72] P:1875.90 E:0.111334 |  but we won't play very well.
[7397.72 - 7400.72] P:1904.55 E:0.112836 |  I've got to say every player is running their heart out, to be honest.
[7400.72 - 7404.72] P:1912.37 E:0.104312 |  Everyone looks tired, fatigued, it's not coming together,
[7404.72 - 7407.72] P:1873.07 E:0.116881 |  I'm not stepping back going where we look a little bit,
[7407.72 - 7411.72] P:1868.78 E:0.106211 |  it's just not happening and it's not going well
[7411.72 - 7413.72] P:1917.85 E:0.100214 |  but to have four points is a great position.
[7413.72 - 7416.72] P:1805.14 E:0.119627 |  When Harry Kane was brought up, Karl Walker took the captain's arm
[7416.72 - 7418.72] P:1714.19 E:0.105928 |  and here he is with Kelly Summers.
[7418.72 - 7422.72] P:1507.85 E:0.083296 |  It all started so well but unlike Sunday, you didn't get the result,
[7422.72 - 7424.72] P:1286.60 E:0.080951 |  can you explain that England performance?
[7424.72 - 7426.72] P:1121.10 E:0.083070 |  I think it's tournament football.
[7426.72 - 7431.72] P:1263.77 E:0.092374 |  Listen, this is a good Denmark team and we're top of the group
[7431.72 - 7435.72] P:1239.80 E:0.103758 |  so let's try and take a positive from this game and we're not lost,
[7435.72 - 7439.72] P:1293.88 E:0.097144 |  we've conceded a great strike from outside the box
[7439.72 - 7441.72] P:1285.40 E:0.100366 |  and sometimes you have to take your off to go goals,
[7441.72 - 7444.72] P:1139.26 E:0.094213 |  I thought the first goal was done well and set off really well
[7444.72 - 7447.72] P:1267.28 E:0.109066 |  as we did the other day but we managed not to see the game out
[7447.72 - 7450.72] P:1384.31 E:0.091480 |  but we're top of the group so let's move on to the next game.
[7450.72 - 7453.72] P:1447.57 E:0.102462 |  You were getting forward as a team and both yourself as well,
[7453.72 - 7455.72] P:1592.04 E:0.099464 |  so much early on, why did that change?
[7455.72 - 7458.72] P:1571.34 E:0.094866 |  I think it's just a game, it's a game, you know, obviously.
[7458.72 - 7461.72] P:1548.35 E:0.096311 |  You're sensing the game, you're sensing their feeling,
[7461.72 - 7463.72] P:1233.19 E:0.107730 |  they probably had the upper hand in certain parts of the game
[7463.72 - 7464.72] P:1219.73 E:0.105894 |  so you go off for that.
[7464.72 - 7468.72] P:1404.43 E:0.102672 |  As defenders you try and think of what if rather than me charging forward
[7468.72 - 7470.72] P:1390.06 E:0.104356 |  they go and score and then all of a sudden they're blaming us
[7470.72 - 7472.72] P:1399.12 E:0.107671 |  as a defence that we're not in position.
[7472.72 - 7475.72] P:1340.30 E:0.110516 |  So listen, we've got enough up front to go and score goals
[7475.72 - 7478.72] P:1352.60 E:0.104695 |  and we've got enough as a team to go and defend so listen,
[7478.72 - 7481.72] P:1594.29 E:0.090592 |  let's take it as a point, a well-deserved point
[7481.72 - 7483.72] P:1464.23 E:0.104836 |  and we'll move on to the next game.
[7483.72 - 7486.72] P:1362.44 E:0.104945 |  Is the manager telling you to drop back deeper once you do score?
[7486.72 - 7491.72] P:1089.09 E:0.100546 |  No, no, listen, the manager's expressed that he wants us to play free attacking football.
[7491.72 - 7494.72] P:1428.23 E:0.112510 |  Sometimes in tournament football you have to manage the game.
[7494.72 - 7497.72] P:1808.19 E:0.078095 |  It is what it is, that's why it's so hard to win tournaments
[7497.72 - 7499.72] P:1727.26 E:0.024762 |  just as like the Champions League.
