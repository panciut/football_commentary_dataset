 Roy Hodgson shaking hands with Andrew Apeelo, who's bearded, has to be said, looks quite magnificent as we go to Ian Dennis. Touch line in Manaus. The two teams are in the tunnel. Andrew Apeelo has shaken hands with Roy Hodgson, as well as the England captain, Stephen Gerrard. And he just has a little glance as well to his left at Andrew Apeelo. I can see that on a giant screen towards the England team. As Roy Hodgson, the gentleman that he is, is actually going across the Italian bench and shaking the hand of every Italian member on that bench. What was it, 13 years ago, when he left Italian football and now in his grey suit, Roy Hodgson has a little glance around the tunnel, and he will be feeling extremely proud. Remember when England qualified for the World Cup? And what an honour. He will be for him tonight. He's of course encountered a World Cup before with Switzerland in 1994, but this is his first game at the World Cup, managing your own country. So a proud moment for Roy Hodgson, and I'm sure this will be a proud moment too for Stephen Gerrard, because tonight he joins an elite band of names, Billy Wright, Bobby Moore and David Beckham. And now you can add Stephen Gerrard to that list to leave England in three major tournaments. The beeper flag is carried out onto the pitch by some boys and girls wearing bright yellow shirts and navy blue shorts. There is the beeper fanfare. Everybody with their smartphones is trying to capture that moment, as now the referee will come out. He'll take the Brazuca ball off the podium and behind him, Stephen Gerrard and Andrea Perlow lead out England and Italy, and there is an explosion of noise in the jungle, live in the house on Five Live. The England supporters behind me, two of them have replica World Cup trophies I can make out. A cuddly Shrek in a miniature wane, Rooney Top. There are two fans dressed as English Knights. They must be losing some pounds tonight, because what is noticeable when I first started talking pitchside, there was the breeze. That breeze now is dissipating as we get ready for the National Anthem. The opening game for England in Group D in the 2014 World Cup. MUSIC The National Anthem of Gusto Asti, the England supporters behind me with their arms and fists clenched. And now we get ready for the National Anthem of Italy, here in Menace. MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC The Italian National Anthem, and in the clear skies of the now above the stadium, a helicopter hovers as England will now go down the line. In fact, the Italians will go down the line. Andrea Perlow leading the Italian team, shaking the hands of all of the England players. Before the England National Anthem, I noticed that Daniel Sturridge had a bottle of water, and he just poured it over his face. Because what is interesting is that breeze has disappeared, that was maybe here 45 minutes ago. Speaking to Stephen Gerrard, and we've spoken on many times, whether it be in Portugal, Miami, or indeed Rio and Menace, he said, we've talked the talk, now we've got to walk the walk. The England players posed for their team photo. Everybody can remember Bloom Fontaine and four years ago and how they capitulated against Germany. England have an excellent record in opening games in a World Cup. They haven't been beaten since 1986. How will they fare in their opening game in Group D? Pitch side in Menace on five-life, but very soon you'll hear the commentary team of Mike Ingram, Danny Mills and Alan Green. As Johart wonders over and gives the thumbs up to the England supporters. Just a quick final one from Chris Waddle. Chris is like an experienced, like no other, is it? How much football you play, you're playing for your country in a World Cup? I just hope they play the instructions they enjoy, they relax, and they play at the tempo which the Italians will not enjoy, but keep the ball a lot better than we normally do. Chris and I'll take your calls after the full-time whistle. 0-500-909-693-85058 on the text, at BBC Five Live on social media and use the hashtag BBC World Cup. This is it, then England underway, live on five-life from Menace, with Danny Mills, Mike Ingram and Alan Green, your commentary team. So Brazil came from behind to win their opening game. Then we had Spain, the World Champions, thrashed by Holland. Today, arguably an even bigger upset, Uruguay losing to Costa Rica. But for most of you listening to Five Live, this is where the World Cup begins. England relatively unburdened by expectation, more cubs than lions in the starting 11, fresh faces, exciting players, we hope. This is the starting 11. Goalkeeper Hart defends Johnson, Cahill, Jaguil and Bangs, then Gerard and Henderson, Sterling, Rooney and Wellbeck, and finally, Sturridge. Entirely without goalkeeper and captain Poupon, replaced by Syragoo, their defense, Damian, Paletta, Barzagli and Chiellini, then Marquisio, Pirlo, the key man and captain tonight, and De Rossi, then Verati, Balotelli and Candreva. The officials are Dutch. We've got, in referee, Björn Kipers, easily one of the best referees in the world of football. He's just checking, as always, in these penultimate seconds before kickoff, which I think we've got a few remaining, television all around the globe will want their advertising finished and get ready for the start of this game. Your thoughts, Danny? Final thoughts for four kickoff. Well, just looking very, very quickly, the formation's very, very interesting. Wayne Rooney has gone to the left-hand side, looks indeed that Sterling is going to play in that number 10 role off Daniel Sturridge. Pirlo looks like he may play further forward, with De Rossi being the holding player. England's World Cup is underway. Italy dressed in blue, England all in white. They'll save those red shirts for when they're absolutely necessary. Thank you very much indeed. Italy in possession at the moment with De Rossi. And looking for movement down the right-hand side. It'll be interesting to see how the high temperature affects the pace of play. It's hit long towards Balotelli. A cross came Gary Cahill, and Cahill puts it out of play for a throw into Italy, deep inside the England half. Italy playing from right to left, as we look out from our high commentary position, but it's beautifully centred over the halfway line. Pirlo chipped the ball down the right-hand side, slightly ahead of his target, and it's behind for a goal kick. Just to confirm those slight changes that maybe we expected. De Rossi is going to be the holding player for Italy. In front of that is a four-man midfield with Pirlo, Verrati, Marquisio and Candreva. At England, Wayne Rooney playing on the left-hand side. It's Raheem Sterling playing off Daniel Sturridge, although it does look like Sterling Rooney in particular are going to move round. They are. I mean, currently, Welbeck was playing behind Sturridge. It's just flexibility, fluidity in that front four for Inge. They lose the ball, and then that foot was slightly high by Johnson on Chiellini, and I think it's a free kick to Italy. Chiellini looked at Johnson, but what does he expect? It's an early challenge in a World Cup game, and it's a free kick to Italy. The stadium isn't full. The Arena, Amazonia, it holds allegedly around 40,000. There's going to be a grotesque white elephant after the World Cup because there isn't a club, a football club in this city capable of filling it. But there you go. That's what happens to countries when they stage a World Cup. It happened in South Africa as well. No doubt it will happen markedly in Qatar if it ever gets to Qatar in eight years' time. We concentrate on Brazil 2014. Five live-year stations to listen to everything that matters in the World Cup. England with a throwing. Johnson will take it short of the halfway line. He throws it towards Sturridge, that cleared by Italy. Perleau got a nudge in the back there from Jordan Henderson, but it's back now to Paletta, and Paletta finds Bersagli. Bersagli to Paletta once more. Midway inside his own half on De Peerle. No one obviously at the moment is picking up Perleau, and maybe they should be after a glorious pass like that. Forward to Marquisio, wide to the far side of the field. Ball played into the six-yard box for England, and it's cleared by Phil Jagielka. How to play on the far side for a throw-in to Italy. Andreva, who is genuinely a winger for club and country, takes the throw-in and throws it back to De Rossi. De Rossi looking for Andreva once more, then he was marked, so he turns and plays it back to the halfway line. Now it's taken up by Perleau. Perleau forward to Marquisio. Marquisio's pass was loose, and England cleared, and here's Sturridge into Sturling, running the good run through the inside left position, well back to his left as well. Sturling doesn't need him at the moment, then he shoots from long range, good discreetes. I thought that was into that initially, but it was just a noptical illusion, as the ball crashed into the side netting. I didn't think the goalkeeper delivered it, did it go? Very, very positive from Maheem Sturling. A great start. Alan almost getting very, very excited. Almost, almost. The ball from the angle, hit the side netting, it looks from some angle surely, but it might have just sneaked into the top corner. But a great start from Maheem Sturling. Got the ball and ran it, people, and that's why we wanted him in the side. I remember many years ago at Anfield, the in-rush shot, and the ball actually hit an advertisement holding behind the goal, but it flew so quickly past the goalkeeper. It seemed to nestle in the back of the net, but I was the only one at Anfield who thought it was a goal. Jimmy Anfield very quietly said, it's not a goal either. Now, there was that from Sturling, but it was a flash from the 19-year-old from Liverpool. One of five Liverpool players in this England starting 11, two from Everton, two from Manchester United, one from Manchester City, Joe Hart, that's the goalkeeper, and then, of course, Gary Cahill, the lone representative from outside the north-west. That's true from Kialini, giving the ball away to Welbeck. Welbeck's first touch, not great, though he has one to throw in. Midway inside the Italian half, near side of the field. Johnson's going to take it. Now, Rooney is up in the D of the Italian penalty. The throw goes to Sturridge. Sturridge controls it well, passes it back to Welbeck. Welbeck into Sturling, into the penalty, tried to beat a defender. Ball rebounds to Henderson, and the shot is saved by the goalkeeper. Still in play, near side of the field. Sturridge, right of the penalty area. Sturridge checks onto his left foot, onto his right foot, teasing the defender one way or the other, chips it into the near post. Good run by Welbeck, a trick to backheal the ball to Sturridge. It's cleared by Italy who made the interception and looked how deep Ballotelli is. Near side of the field, halfway inside his own half. Plays it back to Marchesio. It's a good ball by Marchesio to the far side. And Darnie, over the halfway line. Now, Italy attack with Kendrava. Left over the edge of the England penalty area. Quite a bright start to the game, particularly for England, two enterprising shots and goal from Sturling and then Henderson. Now, Pirlo flicks the ball forward, but Ballotelli had retreated rather than going forward, and the ball bounces through to Johar. Really good start from England. Raheem Sturling has been evolving in the best two moves so far. His shot into the side netting, and then a jinking little run. Came back to Henderson, hit it. Another very, very good strike. Syragou, well, a good save low to his left-hand side, and that'll do him a good job in terms of confidence. But England started very, very brightly. Here's Damien on the far side of the field. He's another Bressetel defender for Italy. He's played right back, he's played left back. He's a good defense for his club, Torino. Tonight, he's at right back for his country. And it's near side of the field. Italy in possession. Back to Boisagli. And on to Verati, of whom Gianluca Viali was speaking so effusively before kickoff. On to Cendreva, just over the half-way line. Back to De Rossi. De Rossi available again. And now Pirlo, almost standing on the centre spot. To De Rossi. Italy patient. This is what we expect from them. They don't always start World Cup as well. In fact, they started four years ago absolutely abysmally as World Cup holders and went out of the group stage in South Africa. Here's Balotelli, inside right channel for Italy. Balotelli, back to Pirlo. And De Rossi wants more. Verati makes himself available deeper than De Rossi. The pass is inside though to Marquisio. Marquisio inside left channel. On to Chiellini, up towards the England penalty area. Chiellini presses in low. Good dummy by Pirlo. Pirlo lets the ball run. No attempted shot and goal, not at the moment. Verati. Good spell of possession this for Middley. Then it's flicked into the England penalty area. Gary Cahill heads it away, drops to Pirlo. Pirlo runs into the box, appeals for handball, and then there was a shot wide by Chiellini. They're all appealing to the Dutch referee. There was an England hand on the ball inside the penalty area, and the referee ignores it. Well, Pirlo played a lot further forward than we may be expected. Just tried to dink the ball over Glenn Johnson. Glenn Johnson, hand right by his side. Yes, it did hit him on the arm. Nothing he could do from that range. And now a really good game so far. The England, almost playing on the counterattack, if you like. You know, we know they have that pace and storage and Raheem Sterling. England having to key in seed. A little bit too much of possession. They've got to be wary in the final third. You know, when Pirlo and Raheem get on the ball, they're looking for those little slide rule passes or dinks over the top. Eight minutes gone in Manaus. England nearly listening to five-life, your World Cup station of Brazil, 2014. Italy have nice settled. De Rossi sliced the ball through, played on to the far side by Condrava, cost into the England penalty area, lifts in the air, I think off a defender, into the safe hands of Joe Hart. Joe Hart is sweating profusely according to Ian Dennis in the warm-up. Decline to wash his hair. Leaves that for the ads. Great ball by Rooney to the near side. England right. Good control by his club colleague, Danny Welbacke. Now taken up by Daniel Sturridge. Glenn Johnson to his right. Played forward to Johnson. Burnley crossed into the penalty area. He's got it in the back of the net. The ball goes back, and a good catch from the defender. OK, that was a bit too high for Welbacke. But by Citigroup the goalkeeper, and immediately thrown out to Pirlo. Decent ball in from Glenn Johnson on the right-hand side. As you said, just a little bit too high, and Citigroup came with an easy catch. A very open game so far. I think so far this World Cup we're all a bit surprised at how teams have started, and maybe attacked more than they would normally. Remember, we haven't had a draw yet so far so far in the tournament. When this draw was made, England, Italy and Manass, the first of England's games in the group, it looked nailed on to be nil-nil. But it's an enterprising start from both teams. Here's Verati. A little deeper than we expected him to play. Te Chiellini, offering it left back tonight. Into Paletto or Parma. And onto Barzagli of the Champions Juventus. De Rossi of Roma. And there Verati once more. Like the goalkeeper, Syragri, plays in France now for Panissan Germain. Back to De Rossi. And England relatively happy at the moment. The Italy of the possession, particularly when Pirlo overheats the pass straight through to Joe Hart. Hart throws out to the far side, and it's with Leighton Banks. Onto Wayne Rooney. Rooney leads it to the skipper Gerard. And into Jordan Henderson inside the centre circle. Onto the nearside. Cesare Fran Deli, evident in the set-nicholary at the moment. No sign of Roy Hodgson. Here's Danny Welving, approaching the Italian penalty area. Plays it wide to Sturridge. Once more, you see the fluidity of those front-four players for Ingram. Now it's with Gerard. To Baines in the far side of the field. Baines in now to Raheem Sturring. Sturring looking for a 1-2. Didn't quite come off. Rooney still might win the ball for Ingram. Didn't quite do so. Italy care, then they give it away. Shot by Welving. It's Paletta that gave the ball away unnecessarily. Straight into Danny Welving's feet. 25 yards from goal. Good touch. Didn't quite catch it cleanly. Just dragged it across the face of goal. They're in positive from England. They're working the Italians very, very hard. From the goal kick, which was taken short by Italy, it's with De Rossi. De Rossi, who's deeper than Perlo so far in the game. Good ball towards a colleague in the halfway line. Clicked on to Chiellini over the halfway line. The left back. That was a hard pass in to Balotelli. Balotelli made something of it. And Verati collects it. Now to De Rossi again. Man free in the far side of the field. That's Darmien the right fullback, but he's ignored. It's played to the left side for Italy. Chiellini into Perlo. Just signed a new two-year contract with his club. At 35 years of age. Outstanding under Perlo. Perlo. He's in the lead. And then leaves it. And on the goes to the far side of the field. To Darmien. Darmien. Into Darmien once more. Very, very patient. De Rossi. That's a good ball to the left side. Chiellini relatively on mark. Chiellini into Marquezio. Perlo once more. Perlo's looking to Darmien towards the far side. Plays it accurately. And then passes the ball sideways. Dangerously though, when they change gear. Now the ball swung in towards Balotelli. Ahead of Balotelli. And it's easily caught by Johar. You're going to allow him to have the ball up until now. With a comfortable possession. But what they're doing is staying organised. Just controlled by Welbeck. Feeds it on quickly to Sturridge. Sturridge cutting it from the right side. Takes on Palate. Into the fennels here. Trying to pull it back. But it was a good run by Daniel Sturridge. Again, positive from Daniel Sturridge. Showing that he's got the legs on those Italian defenders. That will worry them. The only slight problem for England is that the Italian fullbacks are both getting forward at times. The midfielders aren't picking them up. And their formation is more of a 4-1-2-2-1. With Candreva and Verati playing off Balotelli, if you like. And sometimes they're just finding those balls in those little pockets in between. Steven Gerard, Jordan Henderson. And then they're playing off Balotelli. And then they're playing off the ball in between Steven Gerard, Jordan Henderson and the English defence. That's the only time that England look in a little bit of trouble. Sterling just tapped the ankle of Verati. So it's a free kick to Italy. Taking quickly. Kealini, poaching the England penalty area. His pass should have been collected properly. Henderson intercepted though. And England see the referee blue for a free kick. England had possession and could have started a counterattack. Wanted to start a counterattack. But now they're bringing the ball back to where the referee wants the free kick. Fixed side is Ian Dennis. Breathless here Alan. That breeze that was around 45 minutes ago could do with returning. I think for the players' point of view, it's stifling pitch side. But the England supporters behind me, as you may well hear, are in excellent voice. 14 minutes played. You're listening to 5 Live in the BBC, your work-up station. England 0, Italy 0. England with those two early shots and goal. That was certainly the second of them from Jordan Henderson. Provoked a save from Syriacou. And then they're playing off the ball. That was certainly the second of them from Jordan Henderson. Provoked a save from Syriacou. The first one by Raheem Sterling. Filled me. I thought it was the net. Of course, it was only the side. Got all excited, Alan, for a minute. It's the most excited I've been in your company, Danny, for a few days now. We've got a long time together. It's only going to get worse, don't worry. Kale for England. Onto Johnson. Johnson over the half way line. He's folding off two England players, but then he runs into a third Jordan Henderson. And it's now Wellbeck again. No one down the right side. It's back to Henderson. Sweeped by the Liverpool player to an Everett and fullback on the far side. Layton Baines into Sturridge. Inside the penalty area. Sturridge back to Wellbeck. And now taken up by Gerard. About 40 yards out from the Italian goal. He glides the ball to Glenn Johnson down the near side. The England right. And it's a goal for him. A little bit overambitious from Glenn Johnson. We have seen him cut in from the right fullback area before. And it has some decent shots in towards goal. That one just snaps at it a little bit. Panicked a little bit of nothing else. But no complaints from England so far. All the players are getting a good feel of the ball. They've started quite brightly. They've just got to keep their concentration. That could be the only thing that let England down. We are quite close to the equator here. In the Amazonian city of Manass. And it went from clear to clear. Blue sky very quickly. To total darkness above the arena. Brilliantly floodlit. And it's made for a top mark between two top countries. Here's Verati for Italy. Back to De Rossi in the centre circle. Pirlo available. He chooses not to play at the Pirlo. He comes to the left side to Chiellini. Now Marquesi. And Kezia back to De Rossi. At least slow in the build up. Verati, Darwin available on the far side. The pass is shorter than the ball. And it's Cendreva. Cendreva up to the edge of the England penalty. Then you expect Verati. Why did Darwin on the far side? Cendreva wants more. He's standing on the ball. And now, trade deep. Back towards the centre circle. Towards De Rossi. De Pirlo. De Rossi wants more. They'll wait and they'll wait and they'll wait. Until they see an angle where they can play. And a cute pass through. Back to Cendreva. His first time cross. Too long for two Italian players. Straight into the answer, Johard. 17 minutes gone. 0-0 England and Italy on 5-5. He's Henderson. Henderson to Wilbur. England started very brightly. But the Italians have been in command of possession over the last few minutes. Yeah, but I think we expected that. We know the Italians are always going to have an awful lot of possession. I think Verratti's just giving a foul away. On Raheem Sterling. He's just grabbed his shirt. Didn't want him to go forward. Got in his way. Typical Italian defending, if you like. England doing very, very well up till now. Pirlo is looking for that little ball. Dinking it over the top. That little floated right foot pass. Looking for runners going either from the field or from Ballatel. They scored like that in one of their warm-up games. That's a definite tactic they're trying to employ. And Gerard played the resultant three. Kick to Johnson. Back to Gerard. Jageel gone to Cale. Still inside his half. In the England half that is. Up to the halfway line. The ball played forward towards Johnson. Johnson's pass to Wilbur wasn't good. Pirlo takes it up for Ritley. Here's Verratti. Back to Pirlo. And Pirlo just chips it to the far side. And Damien. He goes his way. No one is really picking up. Pirlo. Maybe that's the way Hoshen has decided to play. On the far side of the field. It's with Damien once more. He's got Barzagli available. And it goes to Juventus, central defender. Juventus. Have three central defenders in this Italian squad. One of them in the centre of the fence tonight. The other playing it left back. Pirlo. Two of one of those central defenders. Kialini. Mintos. The ball was moved all over the place. There was a shot from distance. Even from a high vantage point. Luckily for Johar it didn't bounce just in front of him. But he did fumble it slightly. It has a close smile. It blows his cheeks out. It's a difficult one. It's down to the humidity. The ball sometimes flies around a bit. That was a climb that came a while ago. the ball sometimes flies a little bit differently. You were saying to me earlier you didn't think it was quite as humid as you would expect? No, it's not. It's not as humid. It's still very, very hot. Although now it's dark, the temperature drops slightly. Mckesee tried to find Ballotelli, but it's quickly snuffed out that combination of Cahill and Johnson. It's a little bit like a swing bowler. Obviously playing cricket, they're looking for the low clack of a little bit of humidity can make the ball swing. Obviously the humidity is still very, very humid compared to what we are used to. Again, those long shots will just affect the ball very, very slightly. Well, Citigau had a couple of problems early on with England long-range shooting. England fans, I think, outnumber the Italians who voted inside this arena. It's still beggars' belief for me how far they're happy to travel. It's not just a matter of going to Rio and having a sort of holiday-come-world cup in Rio. They've made the 1,800-mile journeys we did yesterday, Danny, the plane ride off to Manaus. Here's Raheem Sterling on the far side of the field. Sterling started brightly. He jinxed inside one defender, then runs into another and loses the ball, and Perlos slid to the far side of the field. And, Italy will counterattack here. Only Ballotelli is through the middle. The pass is ended, Ballotelli. It hits Jagiolka and then loops in the air. Jagiolka heads it carefully back to Johar. That's what England have to be careful of. Several times in their warm-up games they've been hit when they've given the ball away, and then the opposition have been able to break. The turnover of possession England must concentrate. When they give the ball away in that final third, they must be in a position, a very good sound defensive position, to stop Italy attacking them very, very quickly. If you weren't listening to Five Live earlier, you'll have missed it easily. In my view, the upset of the World Cup so far, and that takes a little bit of a time to look at. Spain losing five on to Holland. Uruguay won Costa Rica three. And, Pereira, the Uruguayan was sent off. He will miss England's game against the South Americans in Sao Paulo. Here's Henderson breaking forward on the right side. Henderson gets there before Coletta. Henderson wide towards the right, and it goes to Welbeck. Welbeck slides the pass back to Gerard. Gerard a long way out. Chips into the far side. Sterling brings it under control. Just outside the penalty here. Takes on the ball back. Crosses goes a great cross. And goodness gracious, that was an interesting challenge, let's say, on Welbeck on the edge of the six-yard box, but they're roughly ignored it. Brilliant from Raheem Sterling yet again. This time on the left-hand side, drove the ball across the six-yard box. Welbeck was never really going to get there, but the two centre-backs came charging. Barzagli and Peletta just blocked him out of the box again. That Italian defending that we're so used to. Putting their body in the way, little short pulls and blockages. To pick side, Neymar Dennis. Just to say, Alan, from that shot before at Jilhar, I can't repeat what he said, despite being after the watershed, but I can tell you that after his expression, he was surprised at the level of how that ball deviated in the air, and that will be a key feature of these Brazucas, how they move in the air. Goodness, it's 20 pass, midnight, and beyond that, back in the UK. 20 pass, I'm still on realtime. 20 pass to 11 hours. I'm still on realtime. I'm hoping this is my only game in this region during the World Cup. Manass is an hour behind, real. Here's Balotelli. Balotelli shoots over the crossbar and also Whitefield, we're midway through the first half, and here's my finger. Well, after all the talk about the pitch, it's OK, isn't it, Daniel? Yeah, pitch is absolutely fine. I know it's been a sprayed dream, but it's not causing any problems. There's no real bubbles, and all this fear about this intense heat and humidity has pretty much gone away. Yes, it's very, very warm. I expect pitch time now, might be 25 degrees or so, maybe, but obviously it's dark now, and the humidity is very, very low. England playing from left to right, and going forward into the areas. Danny Welbeck, and he's balling back to Sturridge, goes off the defender. And it'll be a corner kick over on the far side. How lucky are Italy in that situation? Barzagli got a touch, it loops over the top, as Welbeck strode into the box, again drove the ball across the face of goal. Barzagli sliding in towards his own goal, hit his right foot, looped up, Sturlin, a story story couldn't get there, looped past the far post and out for a corner. Corner kick to England then, over on the far side to be whipped in by the captain, Stephen Gerrard. It travelled a very long way, almost dropped to Rooney, who bundles for possession at the far post, and it's gone behind for another England corner. Italian defence looking very, very shaky. Brilliant ball in from Stephen Gerrard, whipped in with pace, players going in, almost fell to Wayne Rooney at the far post. How it got through all those players, I do not know, but it's another corner. Five live at the World Cup in Manasse, England nil, Italy nil, 23, nearly 24 minutes gone in the first half, and England have had three strikes at the Italian goal in the first ten minutes. Syragoo, the replacement for the injured Buffon, and now Leighton Baines prepares to take this left-footed corner. There are words between the referee and Syragoo and Daniel Sturridge, and now we'll have this England corner. England going forward, looking pretty good, but the Italians on the counterattack, often dangerous. Here comes the England corner kick, hoisted high, Syragoo spilled it first time and then holds on to it second time. The only problem really, watching while Alan was commentating, the danger seems to be from Italy down that right-hand side. The full-back Damian gouts forward very quickly, and there's great support from Cam Draver, who looks quite a player, and so Leighton Baines and Phil Jagialka are going to have to be really sharp this evening. Nil nil on five live as the ball is played to Damian, who's winning only his second cap. Damian bursting forward, looks to Ballatelli, now it goes to Cam Draver, worked back into midfield and Perlow, who's 30 yards away from Joe Hart's goal. Still Perlow, biding his time, looking for his clubmate, Kylini. Kylini tackled by Johnson, and the fact that the full-backs can go forward, De Rossi is protecting them and almost becoming at times one of three centre-backs for Italy. He's also played there before as well, we must add, but it is, it's effectively, you've got Marquisio and Cam Draver playing behind Ballatelli. Two players sat behind them in Verratti and Perlow, and then one deeper in that hold midfield role. And it's just causing one or two problems, as you said, out wide, especially on that right-hand side at the moment. Danny Mills with us on five live, they do pass the ball around beautifully the Italians when they're in possession. Now it's Rooney back in defence, looking that pass towards Stirling was a bit short, in came the challenge from Damian, which takes Stirling out, and it's going to be a free kick to England back inside their own half. It's the second time the countries have met in the World Cup, the other time was, I suppose, a bit of a non-event really, because it was for third and fourth place after England suffered that semi-final defeat in 1990 in Italy in 90, and it wasn't the England first team that played that night, it was Shilton's last game. Italy all in blue, of course, De Rossi, who's approaching 100 caps for Italy. It's always a game too many, that isn't it Mike, that third and fourth place player, nobody wants to be in that. I'm surprised up until now, they haven't yet ridden that. Now Verratti over on that right-hand side of the field, and there's a lot of experience in this Italian team, but there's also a lot of inexperience at international level. There are four players with less than 10 caps, and now his young Verratti onto the Centurion Perlo, the captain, and now Keelini, who's inside the England half. It's Nil Nil here in Manasse, and on a very humid evening, it's a sauna heat down there really for these players. Italy with Can Draver, who turns and finds the ever-willing full-back Damia. Ballatelli's poised in the area, but the ball goes short. Still Can Draver, England have got just about everybody back apart from Sturridge. Verratti now to De Rossi, and back again to Verratti. Can Draver now, takes this shot on, and it was well-wide in the end. Jo Hart not forced into making any kind of a save there. That's a goal kicked to England. We've played 27 minutes. It's Nil Nil. Both goalkeepers not troubled to the excess. That one long-range shot that Jo Hart really had to keep his eyes, that they moved through the air. Sturlin had a decent chance of winning to side netting, and of course there was that fantastic strike from Jordan Henderson. But I think at the moment England we're fairly content with the way things are going. Maybe just want to get on the ball a little bit more, but Pirlo, as maybe not expected, hasn't really dictated the tempo of the play. Yes, he's getting on the ball from time to time, but up until now hasn't done anything of real no. Looked at him a couple of times when Alan was commentating Pirlo, and he gives the defender sometimes the eye. He looks one way and passes the other way. He's a fantastic player. And now England with Sturling in this role. Interestingly, Roy Hodgson brought Sturling on and played him in that role in that final game in London against Peru. So he's obviously thinking ahead to tonight. Now it's Welbeck into Sturling. Sturling up against the defender Paletta. Borges wouldn't come down for Danny Welbeck, but Sturling's kept it in. Little jinking run. There's always a second defender there though. He goes past the first one, and then of course the Italians who are masters at defending managed to get the cover when it's required. Johnson with an England throw, halfway inside the Italy half, down this near side the right. England nil, Italy nil in this opening game in the World Cup, which we've looked forward to for such a long time. Johnson, he'll lose that. Keelini, who's showing his great ability to play through the back four, playing it left back tonight, and now Barzagli over to Damian, who's found space once more down that right hand side. He's gone into midfield and Virati. England's Gerard just closing Virati down. Perlo just switched it on to Marquisio. Marquisio into Marco, into Mario Balletelli. Johnson will turn this ball back though to Joe Hart, and it's just dropped a gear or two in the last five minutes. Maybe the player is starting to feel the heat down there. It's Daniel Sturridge winning a throw in of Claudio Marquisio, but unlike the game when they last made in a tournament, which was pretty one-sided in terms of possession, England are giving as good as they're getting here, Danny. England are keeping the ball much better. They're not playing too many long balls, which makes it very, very awkward. As you mentioned, we know how good the Italian defenders are. Well-drilled, but also individually exceptional. They never let the man go past them. I'm pleased with England up till now. I don't think there's no real concern this game, and at the moment, there's no reason why they shouldn't go on and maybe win the game. No, you said something really interesting earlier on, and it's that concentration at this level. Every single second, you have to concentrate, and that's where the heat and the tiredness will come in. As you get towards the end of the game, the first thing that goes is concentration, and with the likes of Piero, it just takes one pass. That little scooped, flippy right-footed pass that just bends over the top of the defenders. That's what England are going to watch out for. Gerard, skim the ball forward. The ball ricochets off Paletta. England haven't hit too many long balls forward, and now they go forward again with Henderson. Sterling trying to control it up against Kylini, who just brushes him aside. Kylini puts his foot on the ball by the touchline. Sterling is trying to deny him, and then the referee has penalised Sterling. And given the Italians a free kick. Back to Ian Dennis, who's down watching pitchside. Yes, behind the goal. Away to your left, Mike. Just a few moments ago, Baines, Jagie Elker and Rune were in a discussion because I think Baines is wary of being isolated. Playing a narrow back four, he is tucking in, but when Candreba looks to come forward and play in Damien from fullback, Baines needs more support on England's left-hand side. I think that's absolutely right. I think we've picked that out from here already. That seems to be one of the biggest sources of danger for England when the ball is right, but now it's left of Mckesio. England nearly nearly in the World Cup on five line. Earlier that incredible result, Costa Rica, Uruguay, Costa Rica winning three-one. That's a long ball through to Balotelli, which his former city teammate, Hart, has. And now Gerard, who's got the Dorossi role in the England team, finds Baines over on the left-hand side. He hasn't been able to get forward very much so far, late in Baines. Rune playing in this wide position, brings the ball in field. It's a little bit slow now from England. They just dropped the tempo a little bit. Rune wants the free kick as the defender went climbing all over him. Dorossi, who's a volatile character, and England do have the free kick. Four of these Italians experienced World Cup victory in 2006. Great experience. Dorossi, Kealini, Barzagli, and Perlo. No buffon tonight. He's at his fifth World Cup. He's watching on. Serigo's got had a good start, though, in goal, away to our right. But now here's this England free kick. It's a long way out from Stephen Gerard, but this ball is moving around. Gerard's kicking in the end. It's really disappointing because it just bounces tingly up at goalkeeper Serigo, and nobody can get on the end of that. Seems to be a little bit of miscommunication about where Stephen Gerard was going to put the ball and bounce harmlessly through to the goalkeeper. But that right-hand side is a little bit of a problem. Kealini, centre-back by trade, naturally doesn't really want to get forward, or not with any great pace. But it's Darmine on that right-hand side and Candre, who's starting to cause one or two problems for Leighton Bones. England nil, Italy nil. Verratti now for Italy, finding Dorossi, who's venturing forward. He hasn't done that very much so far. Verratti now moves the ball onto Perlo. Perlo's on the edge of the England area. England are trying to make it tight. Finds Dorossi that full-back. Darmine's made the run into the area once more. He wasn't picked up. It's for Balotelli. Balotelli's head down across the face. And there's the danger. Dorossi waited for Darmine to make his move down the far side. And it almost cost England that. That really does need to be sorted out. And I'm not surprised Jagi Elkar and Bones have been talking to each other. Huge escape for Italy. Balotelli should have done better with that header. But again, it was that ball out to the right-hand side. England a little bit exposed out there. Wayne Rooney, you know, caught between two stalls at times. You know, got caught in no man's land. That ball crossed into the box. Balotelli didn't quite get enough from the header. And England breathed a huge sigh of relief. But as the ball gets switched again to Darmine, he doesn't need any excuse at all to get forward, Darmine. Only his second cap, but he's he really has settled down well here. And what a menace he's proving down that right-hand side. Now, Marquisio. And again, Darmine is available. But Marquisio slides the ball into the area. And that's a corner kick off Leighton Baines for Italy. And of course, they are pretty good at set pieces the Italians. Roy Hodges, sorry, Mike. Roy Hodges is going to have to address this at half time. Can Draver and Darmine are getting far too often down that right-hand side with time and space in the final third. And soon related, if England aren't careful, they may pay. Well, Keelini and Barzagli have gone forward for the corner. It's a short corner though, taking to Verratti, who tucks it back to Perlow. Let's it run on to Marquisio. Marquisio strikes! Italy score. Marquisio was a well-worked training ground routine. The short corner, Perlow to Marquisio. Marquisio leaves. Johart helpless. And Italy lead 1-0. Devastating for England. A fantastic strike from Marquisio. I have to say that. A well-worked corner. A great strike. England now. Got a bounce back. What was I saying about them being pretty good at set pieces? Down to Ian Dennis' pitchside. Johart with his screw in at places just kicked the turf in anger. Not very happy as he just stands and looks on with his hands on hips. And at this opportunity as well, the England players are actually taking the advantage of the stoppage in play after conceding that goal to take on some liquid refreshments. So bottles of water are being thrown to them from the dugout. And also I should say as well that there is a photographer just by the side of me who is actually requiring some medical assistance. He's struggling with the heat. So it might be a little bit fresher up in the commentary box but certainly pitchside. It is stifling. And England now in the heat are going to have to do it the hard way to come from behind. Thank you, Ian. Don't forget by the way you can follow Five Lives commentary on TV. If you flick the red button, we're there for you. But, well, Perlow and Marquisio, of course, have a great understanding playing together in midfield for Juventus. They've probably done that quite a few times together. But nevertheless, it still took a devastating finish from Marquisio. And it left Johart absolutely helpless. Now can England respond? Here goes Daniel Sturridge down this near side. So many times in recent tournaments England go in front even though they don't necessarily win their opening games. They normally score first. It's a long time since England conceded the first goal in a tournament. In fact, I think it might have even been 1988, that European Championship when Ray Halton scored the Republic of Ireland. Don't remember them being behind since then in an opening game. And now it's all to do, Danny. Well, it is. It was a very well-worked set-piece corner routine, short corner, then played into Perlow who had no intention of touching the ball, let it to Marquisio and shot like an absolute arrow into the corner. Johart, no real chance with that. But I have to say, it's again, it's these problems down England's left-hand side. And Candreva had it and this time didn't release Dami and he was available down the right-hand side. There wouldn't have been anyone from England there to cut it out. Well, the Italians have had a really poor build-up to the World Cup. But now England go forward and Rooney is onside. Boar played into Sturridge. It's an equaliser for England. Great break down the left-hand side. Rooney delivered. Sturridge was there. Stephen Jarrar believes he can write up this World Cup. He scored. It's one-one. The perfect response from Daniel Sturridge. Great break from Wayne Rooney down the left-hand side. A brilliant cross in. Just put the ball into space. Daniel Sturridge gambling. Getting there at the back post. Not an easy finish. Bounced up in front of him but right foot into the back of the net. What is that? Two minutes that Italy led for. Fantastic. What a ball in for Wayne Rooney. Bent to the far post with his right foot and a superb finish from Daniel Sturridge. And the players leave the field for a few drinks. Daniel Sturridge gets a slap on the hand from Frank Lampard. And the thing about Sturridge, we've mentioned it before, Dami. I mean, he missed goals, didn't he, in that last game against Honduras. But he never gets his head down. He just moves on to the next one. It came to him on the half folly on the right-hand side. Which is very, very awkward. There's something down on the bench. Something serious quite happened. The stretch is out already. Can't quite see what's happening from our TV monitors or who it is. But somebody looks in a bad way. At the moment it's impossible. Is it an England player or is it an Italian player? The cameras have moved away now from that. It's an England player. I can see a white sock. But it's so crowded down there that we can't really see anything else. And whether that happened in the celebrations for the goal, I'm not quite sure. But we're still looking to see what exactly happened. We're just seeing replays of the goal. Brilliant from Wayne Rooney on the counter attack. A half folly from Daniel Sturridge did very, very well. Easily that can bounce up. Hit your shin. Go over the crossbar. Kept his iron up. And the perfect response. I'm just looking to see if it's an England player on the field who's been injured. But I'm just looking to see they all seem to be out there. So maybe it's one of the substitutes down there who, and the leg brace has been applied apparently. And we still can't see who it is because all the trainers and the doctors are covering the player. Let's get a verdict on that goal from Chris Waddle who's watching with us tonight, Chris. It was a wonderful goal. Wayne Rooney's not playing wade enough when we lose the ball. But it works sometimes. The fullback's gone on. Wayne really hasn't gone with him, which he hasn't on a lot of occasions today. But it played off his team. He found the space. Wonderful ball. Wonderful finish. Thank you very much indeed, Chris. And the rumours are that it's the physio Gary Lewin. It is Gary Lewin who's been carried off on the stretcher. He's the man, of course, who normally comes on the field to treat players. One of the most potty of the people in the camp. I mean, you'll know him, Danny. Well, that is awful for Gary Lewin, obviously. Physio here, you know, been around England set up for such a long time. We did so many tournaments, so experienced about getting the players fit. But he's obviously done himself some serious damage as he gets carried off on a stretcher. Well, we have no idea how it happened, whether he was celebrating and twisted and fell or whether people ran into him. But anyway, he's been carried off on a stretcher. And England are now at 1-1 here. And it's a really entertaining game. And Raheem Sturdy now played a very difficult ball to Wellbeck on the edge of the area. This is always the danger now for England as the opposition counterattack. And it's ballateli down this left-hand side, just holding the ball sensibly because nobody really in a position to receive from it. England won, Italy won. I think five minutes to go in the first half. I think that equaliser, Mike, just goes to show that the Italian back four doesn't have a great deal of pace. You know, if Rooney can get to run at them, Sterling, Sturridge, England have a great opportunity to go on. But there are concerns, always offside, Candrava. But there are concerns every time Italy build quickly down that right-hand side. They seem to be outnumbering veins at times, Candrava and Damien, the fullback. But of course, Damien, we've been congratulating him going forward, but it was in his area where Rooney crossed to lay on the equaliser for Sturridge. So, Italy having now to get back behind the ball. Rooney, one-one, Marquisio for Italy. They led for a couple of minutes and then Sturridge equalised. All played well by Rooney into Henderson. He's got a bit of space. Henderson drove the ball straight at Verratti. Henderson now looked to try and find Johnson down this near-side. Italians haven't dealt with this yet. Henderson almost sneaked in there against Verratti. And England need to apply the pressure even more so. And they do. They steal the ball off Chiellini. It was well-backed. Back again to the goal scorer, Sturridge. England now with Sturridge working the ball back into his own half. And Jagiolka moves it on to Steven Gerard. Banes now, far side the left. Five-live. The World Cup from Brazil. Three and a half minutes to go in the first half. Stirling now, moving through midfield. Immediately the blue shirt surrounding him. Stirling still. Stirling now, finding Banes. No England player in the area yet. The ball is chipped in towards Rooney. And out comes the man in orange. Sirigou the goalkeeper and the danger on again potentially now. As Perlo finds the Italian goal scorer Marquisio. Now Balotelli taking up some good positions. He's now on this left-hand side. Balotelli, no great pace about the Italians here. Just biding their time as ever. Trying to recover from conceding the goal. And remember, I did say after they'd scored the goal, they haven't had a great build-up to this World Cup. But this is, of course, where it really counts. And here they go again. And again, they're standing off Candrava down the right-hand side. Ball in. And that's away by England. By Jagiolka. Rooney's now in the left-back position. They really are going to have to sort that out. And I'm sure Gary Neville, who's part of the coaching staff, will want to talk about that during half-time. Because that is a real cause for concern down that Italian right-hand side. Rooney. Still inside his own half. Rooney tries to float it to this near side. It could turn out to be a beautiful ball. Oh, Stirlig let it bounce. Oh, that was a mistake. Because it's gone out of play. The problem that England have done that left-hand side is Candrava is the most furthest player forward for Italy. Almost playing it inside right. Wayne Rooney's not quite sure, you know, whether to drop deep or whether to stay in his hole. Layton Baines doesn't want to go in tight. And of course, you've got Damian Overlapham down that right-hand side. And that means Layton Baines is outnumbered. Wayne Rooney could go forward. Exceptional cross with his left foot. But they've got to sort out that left-hand side. Because at the moment England have become exposed far too often. It's a sort of area where they might require a James Milner. Possibly. Although that would of course nullify their attacking ability as well. But anyway, it's 1-1 now, moving towards half-time. Marquisio following a short corner for Italy. England with an equaliser from Sturridge. Now the cross will come in from the right-hand side. And Joe Hart is there. Almost collides with Gary Cahill. Hart takes the ball and rolls the ball out of the area. Stirlig has to be careful not to lose this now. Stirlig to Rooney playing in this deep position. Rooney across the field for Glenn Johnson. England predominantly keeping it short on the ground. But just at time, hitting these long part. And then as they strike that long ball forward, it's innocuous. And it's straight through to Syragun. So one thing that you must never do against an Italian side, just concede possession so cheaply. Closing in on half-time here. Gary Lewin though, the England physio has been carried from the stadium on a stretcher. After the, it seems the goal celebrations following Sturridge's equaliser. Here they go again. Down at right-hand side. More danger for England as Damien goes forward and strikes it in the end over the bar. But they have to sort this out. This is a real problem. Leighton-Baines is getting isolated. That time Damien cut inside. I think again it was Candreva that made an overlapping run. Leighton-Baines getting caught two on one. Not quite sure whether to stick or twist. Had that been a better shot, Joe Hart might have been in trouble. But it's difficult for Leighton-Baines at the moment because he's been exposed. He needs more help on that left-hand side and Roy Hodgson is definitely going to have to do something tactically about that for the second half. Well, we can see it from here. I'm sure they can see it from down there. Fingland want to get something from this game. That's an area that they have to sort out during half-time. Ball is thrown out to the defender, Paletta, who's only winning his third cap. On to the vast experience, Kylini. Fourth official is coming forward now to indicate the added time. And it has very much the end of a first half look at it at the moment. The sides may be just looking forward now to getting into the cool of the dressing room. The ball is again endlessly down that right-hand side. This time though Damien doesn't cut forward. He plays it into midfield and Verratti. Verratti inside the centre circle. Still Verratti. England just backing off. Verratti now two minutes of added time. I think we're going to have here. Still Italy building. De Rossi over to the right-hand side. Now it's Candrava into De Rossi once more. De Rossi's short pass into Perla. Back again to De Rossi. Now Marquisio's ball towards Balotelli and thumped away by England. It mustn't lose the ball here inside their own half. And it's played by Henderson and England are getting just stuck here a little bit. Now it's Johnson. Johnson finding Welbeck near side the England right. Back again to Johnson. Now it's time to get through the half time here now. And some encouraging words I'm sure from Roy Hodgson. But also he's going to have a problem to sort out at half time. Layton Baines again over on the left-hand side. Now Ashley Cole of course in this tournament. And Baines has had quite a world cup baptism here against Italy down the right-hand side. They do seem to be targeting him as well. Gerard now hits the ball across. It doesn't reach. Doesn't reach Welbeck. Marquisio cuts it out. Perlo switches it back. So we're in added time about 50 seconds to go to the half time whistle. England won Italy one on five live. Verratti on to Perlo. Perlo looking to release Balotelli in the area. Out comes Johar. He doesn't get there. Balotelli from the angle. Balotelli tries to kick Johar headed away by England by Jagi Elka. Almost on half time Italy score. First time that Balotelli has really been in the game. Again it's that little slide rule ball down the side from Andro Perlo. Johar did well. Came out, forced Balotelli away. And they're a clever little dink over the top. Nearly went in but Jagi Elka are off the line. Another short corner and they found Perlo on the edge of the area. Verratti now. Another maybe chance for Marquisio. Marquisio chips into the area. There's danger here. The shot is driven in against the post by Cairn Draver. England need the half time whistle. We're playing added time at the end of the first half. England are hanging on here at the end of the first half. And then there's Samarji Bagi on the edge of the area. And the referee may well now decide to blow for half time. Rather than trying to sort that out. So what an eventful first half. England won Italy one. Down to Ian Dennis Kipsy. Just seeing Johar and Mario Balotelli have just playfully barged into each other. And then the respective arms go around each other's shoulders. And little handshake as well from the two former Manchester City colleagues. England then were like boxes on the ropes towards the latter stages of that first half. And Phil Jagi Elka looked tired. His white shirt drenched so tight with sweat. But it was mentally alert to get back to have that ball off the line. And just one other point as I was behind that goal. This is the end where England are going to be attacking in the second half. And the pitch is cutting up. And there are two areas. One just in front of the base of the left hand post. And another one on the left hand side. And if you can imagine a birthday cake and how you peel off the marzipan. That is how the pitch is starting to lift in those two areas. Mark Pugac. And that is how you get back to the table. And then the pitch is going to be over. And that is how you get back to the table. And you get a little bit of a surprise. Thank you, Ian. Just spotted it with Chris Waddle and myself at Stephen Gerald, who I think would have probably changed his shirt anyway at halftime. It is so drenched in sweat. Gave his shirt to an Italian as they walked up the tunnel at halftime. But try and bring you some news about Gary Lewin, who we can only suspect in celebrating, clearly did something to his ankle or his leg. But it was very serious when he was playing for the team. And the ball was in the middle of the line. And the right side is not too bad. Daniel Welbeck is doing a good job with Kear, but probably in runes. He can't play many positions. But he likes to play that number 10 role, doesn't he? And he is getting, when we lose the ball, England is coming into two narrow. And it is an easy outboard for Peerle. Anybody could hit the right back. Letting bins know where they are going on the wing or the way, or the fullback. He has got to back off. And that is why we can't get any sustained pressure on Italy. And that is why we are going to have to get the ball up the tempo of the game 20-25%. We could cause a lot more problems. This is the issue where Wayne Rooney has to sacrifice his natural game and what he wants to do for the good of the team, isn't it? Yeah. He has got, he has got, as soon as he loses it, he has got to be thinking about the left side of midfielder. I am not in number 10. Stirling is playing in the, I put Stirling out, because he is still fullback. I put Stirling out on that left wing against the right wing. I think it has gone relatively well. There is a problem for Leighton Baines down that right-hand side. Can Draver, as I said, play in an inside right position, getting in between the lines, in between where Wayne Rooney doesn't want to be, and Leighton Baines, and then Damien going down that left hand side. I think England have played okay. They have done pretty well. They would be delighted to get back in the game so quickly. A great ball in from Wayne Rooney. Italy, especially with Peerle, are looking for balls over the left wing. They have got a little through balls in the final third. That is definitely a tactic and a ploy of theirs. And really, England should be able to defend with that. It is purely down to concentration. They have just got to keep, know where all the players are, keep marking them, be on the toes for the 1994th minute. Danny, thank you for now. Go and have a drink at halftime as we are watching the replay, Chris, of the goal. We were so worried about Peerle being on the ball, and what he would do on the ball, put us Peerle do a beautiful dummy, which being off and turning him into the scorekeeper in Germany and Harry Lighthouse. It was a good strike. Ootlty, Ringgit and Ricky Coal, fantastic dummy. It was a good骆ed, went through a lot of bodies, Joel Hart could not really say it. It was a good finish. I mean, you look at the two teams in England. If they can play a little bit quicker, especially when you get possession deep, you want them to the left-hand side. It's a fabulous cross, the shape of it, coming back in towards Sturridge. He's too quick for Kaleeni, the fullback, who just cannot keep up with him, why Sturridge has that opportunity. And actually, he has to judge the bounce of the ball, doesn't he, and shape his body accordingly. It's been very easy to spoon that over the top. He's got perfect contact on it. He's got a great season with Liverpool, he gives them the chances, and I just think, England's at the minute, there's a big fear factor. With Italy as well, I'm very happy with the pace of the game. Because they've got older players, they want to play slow. And because of the conditions, maybe, obviously, England must think we can't chase at Harris as much as we want, which is suitably, because of the pace of the game, they're dictating. And if England doesn't say, just raise the tempo, even for the first 20 minutes, you may get your noses in front, and that may be enough. But you would say, you have to say to Wayne Rooney, play, you have to play wider, and you have to come back and help Leighton Baines. Just come on left side, you've got the full back, unless you get a shot to let him come on, tuck in side, number seven or eight, wherever it is, go and say, I'll take the full back, you get a shot on Leighton Baines. But at the minute, he's going in there, there's nobody to mark, so the full back's just on his back, Leighton Baines has been attracted by the lad playing inside, and he's getting an easy ball out for Italy every time. Yeah, they've got two on one on Baines every time, and Pirlo, who's just so good at just like a little lob wedge, isn't he? Just dropping it over his head onto whoever is running outside of Leighton Baines. Let's go to Juliet Farrington, who's down on the beach here in Rio. Yeah, two and a half miles away from you, around 20,000 fans inside. The Italians are being absolutely outnumbered here tonight with the England fans. We've got Matt, we've got Dennis Matt. How are you feeling towards the end of that first 45? Please, we got in with the draw at the end, one-all. First half an hour, I thought we were fantastic. Really positive team selection and to the start, peppered the goal with long-range shots. Didn't deserve to go one-nil down and a fantastic response going back. Really didn't do a lot, but brilliant cross to Starridge, who showed that what he did against Honduras wasn't his usual form, and he's banged it in the back of the net, back to one-all. Right at the end, maybe he could have let another one in, but so one-all's good at halftime, push on to second half, and we can make it a win, and especially after Costa Rica result, and they hope to top the group before the next round. And Dennis, we all thought Stirling's effort was in, wasn't we? There was beer all over the place. So did I. But I'll tell you what, Stirling's the key to this game. He's looking alive, he's looking very, very dangerous. Roy Hodgson, very good selection point, Stirling in, he's looked really, really dangerous. Right, we've got the bar behind me, I'll let you go back to you, Mark. Thank you very much indeed. Now Dan Walker, who is also pitch-side there in Manaus, has tweeted that, what happened with Gary Lewin, the England physio, Dan's tweeted, Gary Lewin flew off the bench along with the rest of the England staff after the goal, immediately collapsed and started banging the ground, obviously in pain. And that's what we saw, and we wanted who it was, we thought he was an England player to start with, but actually it was the physio himself, Gary Lewin, so we wish him the very, very best. But clearly he's done something, it would seem pretty significant to his leg or his ankle or whatever it is, will bring you news as soon as we get that. Chris, in this halftime, I know Stephen Gerald's changed shirts already, but you've changed shirts, don't you? You try and get a drink on board. Do you have a shower? Seriously, do you have a cold shower? No, basically you lie there, you'll get your legs up, trying to get them loose again, and anyway you can't cool yourself down, there'll be ace pucks on the back of the necks, on the legs, there's listen, everything you can think of will be in that change room, trying to cool them down. I just, as I say, it's very difficult, it's easier to sit in there and talk about it, but it is very hard in England, like the player high tempo, unfortunately the conditions are obviously stifling and it's too nearly. And England, well, the England medical staff will be working overtime because they're one man down, sadly. We sent Gary Lewin our very best wishes, we'll let you know what the situation is with him as we go to the newsroom with it, one one in Manass at halftime, here's Mike Young.

Helen says the most important question is has Conor McNamara got his bags back? I'm not sure he has. He's travelling with Tony Pugich though so he went to Spain's training yesterday dressed in crystal palace shorts and socks and I think he might be having to go to the game tonight in a crystal palace away strip.

Let's speak to our sports correspondent, Richard Conway, who has been across this story for some time now. Richard, these latest stories claim that FIFA executives were in the middle of the election. What are the concerns? What are the concerns? What are the concerns? What are the concerns? Sunday times saying tonight they have a report, an internal FIFA report, which was commissioned by General Secretary Jerome Valk just weeks before that vote in 2010 on where the 2018 and 2022 World Cups would take place. The report was published in the 2018 World Cups. The report was cancelled if there was a major terrorist incident. That was because of the close proximity of venues within training facilities, fans of hotels, and that's why they gave it this high risk status. This report, we should probably caution as well, was prepared a very short notice about the challenges faced in getting through a volume of information. He only had one day in which to do that. Nevertheless, this will come on top of those allegations we have seen already against Qatar and it will be a further attack against them and against their suitability to host this World Cup in 2022. Separately, Mark, very briefly, we have also heard from Qatar today, they issued for the first time the allegations that they say were stemmed from Mohammed bin Hamam, Qatar National Hoops, they say paid football officials to support their bid. They say they vehemently deny those allegations and they also talk about how this is a flagrant attempt in there which to prejudice an ongoing independent investigation and that these allegations are baseless and riddled within UNDO. So, I think that's the reason why, if you look at the report, he's concluding his report, we're expecting that in July, the matter will roll on we think until October. Thank you very much, Richard. I know you'll keep across that and all the stories here from the World Cup, one of which sadly concerns the England physio in the injury he suffered in the aftermath of England's equalizer. Ian Dennis, his pitchside in the UK, he's a player who has a very good position. I'm away from my pitchside position. Danny Murphy, who is also pitchside with Gabby Logan, they say he actually saw it and he fears it's a broken ankle. He seems to celebrate and go over on his ankle. They are the fears it might well be a broken ankle but just I'm reading something which says it's the official feed of the England football team. I don't know whether that is official but it's got an FA.com sign on it and quite a few 100,000 followers which says that he dislocated his ankle. I think the suggestion is that he fell over some drinks. Obviously there's a big drinks tray there, isn't there? It was very hard for me to see. I spotted the medical people, one of the physios, treating him straight away because what they've got is sky-colored bits and they were quickly on the scene. Because they gathered around him, I couldn't work out who it was. My initial thought was that it was Ray Lewington because Ray Lewington after the Honduras game was on crutches. I don't know what Ray Lewington had done to warrant that but I saw Ray Lewington's thought that it may have been Ray. Gary Lewin with a dislocated ankle. I would imagine that that Twitter feed is the official feed of the FA. I can just make it out. Stephen Gerrard leading England back out as the second half is about to get under way. Those two areas of this pit are going to be attacking in front of me. Mark has now been flattened completely down. As the teams come out, Chris Waddle with a nice exchange between Arun and Waddle. What are your thoughts on the second half? There is a lot of respect between the two. It suits the tempo. You would like to move around a lot more. But the conditions are not helping England. There are two teams that are afraid to lose when you see the game. Take your calls when it is all over. 0599-693-8505 no Many . Here is the hashtag BBC World Cup, it is at 05دا . First half. There are no changes in the Isn't an吉 fellow being She is afraid. By the time they reach the去了. in front two minutes later. Sturridge equalized for England and here is Daniel Sturridge at the start of this second half. England all in white attacking the end to our left behind which is a huge number of England fans. And they've got a throw in in this near side of the field there left. Banes to take it. If you're right I'm sure Weldbeck will be tracking back and helping out late in Banes much more than Wayne Rooney seemed to be preferred to do. Another throw in is the result is a challenge. came in on Sturridge. Banes to take it live over the edge of the Italian penalty area goes to Weldbeck. Rooney's inside the box so to his Sturridge. Here's Sturling. Sturling moves away from Verati. Beats another Italian player feeds the ball to Weldbeck. Now it's with Banes into Sturling again just a little left of the penalty area but his tackle loses it and it's taken clear by Italy by Kandreva up towards the halfway line towards Balacely. He's tackled by Jaguilka and Jaguilka the Everton defender plays it all the way back to Joe Hart. She was right. Hart had no chance with the shot from Marquisio but it went past four England defenders then when they were fine at all. Yeah I think Wayne Rooney was actually the last man thought about putting his foot out. It's very very difficult in that situation. You know you throw your foot out you can't reach it properly. You have the issue of deflecting it into the goal. It was just a great strike. Well worked set-piece England didn't deal with it. They left Marquisio unmarked on the edge of the box and he fired it directly into the corner but a great response after that. Balacely was well offside England free kick as the result and it's played to Johnson onto the far side and England goal score Daniel Sturridge. Out off for defender Paletta and a throw to England just beyond the halfway line. Far side of the field. That's the England right. Johnson takes it to Wayne Rooney. Back to Johnson. Still inside the Italian half but it's played back into the England half night to Gary Cahill. Cahill supes it to Jagie Elka. Jagie Elka still 15 yards short of the halfway line. Cruised it to his club colleague Baines. Back to Jagie Elka. Jagie Elka looks inside. See's Cahill available. Henderson's available too. And the ball goes to the Liverpool player. And onto another Liverpool player. Five of them in Roy Hodgson's team. And here's Sturridge. Another Liverpool player. Sturridge just left but it pushed away by the goalkeeper. Seem to get down quite late. Siddiqui. England still have the ball. Rooney down the right side is one of the corner. Another good move from England. Daniel Sturridge, a little bit of individual brilliance. Took three Italian defenders out of the game. Not quite sure he caught it as well as he wanted to. But Searragu almost went down in instalments. It took him so long to get down. But again, positivity from England, which is great to see. Now, from the England right side, Leighton Baines will deliver this corner left footed. Three England players grouped around the Italian goalkeeper. Baines wants to put it in his direction. There it goes. Searragu came, didn't make any attempt to catch the ball. And it's a glancing header wide. It must evolve at England player. And it's behind for a goal kick to Italy. Four minutes gone on the second half. England won, Italy won. You're listening to your World Cup station. Brazil, 2014, five line. England could do a little bit better with their set pieces. They haven't been great. There was just that one Steve and Gerard corner that was whipped in and made it way through, made its way through to Wayne Rooney at the far post. But apart from that, I think set piece from England have been a little bit wasted at times. The goal kick is taken short by Italy. Pirlo, now to Virati, back to Pirlo. It just sort of strolls around the game. Looks half-paced, Pirlo, but it's his brain that does all the quick thinking. Nice with Damian, the right pullback, up inside the England half. On it goes now to Candreva. Candreva onto his left foot. Clare Crosser, deep. Ballotelli hits it in. Simple enough goal for Italy. Ballotelli, relatively free on the edge of the six yard box. Dornburn header, dual heart, no chance. And Italy are back in front. England won, Italy too. The moment Candreva cut inside, back onto his left foot. You could see that goal coming. Ballotelli had peeled off at the far post. Again, England's masters of their own downfall. Not defended properly. Layton Baines exposed, two on one. Then he dives in, goes for the cross, doesn't get there. And at Ballotelli, he pulls off Jagyelka at the far post. No, sorry, it's Cahill. But he pulls away from the far post and a good down would have a. But it's this left-hand side. Layton Baines out, numbered in the first place. That's, there's nothing he can do about that. It's very, very difficult. But then he dives into the cross. Candreva cuts back on his left. Dinks the ball to the far post. Gary Cahill gets caught underneath it. Ballotelli, a couple of steps off him. And a very, very good header. Again, Johar, no chance with that one. And England again have it all to do. But it's just this left-hand side that constantly calls. Good work by Sturridge. Sturridge up to the edge of the penalty game to the penalty. Still running, Kanglis Sturridge, but he can't get a third defender. And it's Clatterclerc by Falata, of towards the half-Waila. So England have to come from behind again to get something from this game. Remember earlier, Costa Rica beat Uruguay by three goals to one. Well, Gerard seemed to run into the referee there. But the ball squirts away to England's possession. It's with Sturridge into Welbeck, into the penalty here. Oh, Nalabbeck died by Welbeck. Sorry, that is not a penalty kick. It's an embarrassment. Referee from Holland of Jhon Keifers rightly ignores it. Might be a touch for Jhon, not to pick up a yellow card for that. He's thrown himself again rather than he had to play. To Rossi Perittoli. To the near side and Candreba. Wasn't that a great cross to Candreba? It was a brilliant cross, but it should never have got there. England have tried to address the situation by putting Welbeck on the left-hand side. It's clearly a problem. All first half, it was a problem. And then Leighton Baines. You know, Candreba shaped with his right foot to put the cross in. Leighton Baines dived in, jumped in the air. That allowed Candreba to cut back inside him and just think the ball to the far post. A poor goal from England's point of view. Barati on the halfway line. To Damien, the right back, who loves to attack forward to the score of the latest goal, a peretli, Perittoli, but he moves just a fraction offside. The assistant's flight was up very quickly and it's a pre-kick to England. Well, obviously, we're hoping for an England reply. But if England lose this game, Uruguay have lost. It's an off-blooded stake in Sao Paulo in the two-meat. Well, it's going to be a huge game. I think the fact that Uruguay have lost makes it a harder game anyhow. They all have to come out and play. They are very, very likely to throw Luis Suarez into the mix. Bit or not, I think they all have to gamble in. Of course, if the result stays the same, England also. Henderson, shoots the ball towards the near side to Jaguilca, who lose inside the Italian half. England all in white, Italy all in blue. Now, Gerard. Gerard, good ball forward. Sturryfield didn't control it. And Italy a possession again, and Pirlo does a squander possession. Plays it back to Barzagli. And on from Di Rossi, Italy clearly have grown in stature since their second goal. Pirlo, into Verratti, just over the half way. Tackle and beaten by Gerard. Ball squirts through now to Rooney. Rooney running forward towards the penalty area. Forster run wide, shoots across the face of the Orgel, and it's a drive. Wide of the far post, and it's behind for the golfer. Bets from Wayne Rooney. Shot from distance, didn't quite catch it cleanly. Came across it a bit too much in the end, bubbled three or four yards wide. But England have got to do something about this left-hand side. Struggled all first half, conceded a goal from it, and still it's causing problems. Italy keep probing the England left flank. Wellbeck should be better than Rooney, helping protect Leighton Baines. But so far, that's not the case, in the opening nine minutes with the second half. You're listening to Five Live on the BBC. England trail-itly to what? Here's Stern from Gerard's pass onto Sterry. Johnson's available on the far side. Sterry picks him out, jumps him with room. Crosses first time in towards the six-yard box, but it finds a blue shirt and it's clean. Only as far as Gerard, who chests it down to Baines. Gerard wants more. And Gerard hits a cross-field ball to Glenn Johnson on the far side. Accurately play, good control by Glenn Johnson. Up towards the edge of the penalty chair, into Sterling. Sterling's shot was weak anyway. A hit-hand defender who plays it back to Sudoku, and the goalkeeper hits it under play on the far side of the field for a throw into England. England have got to try and get their full backs further forward. They've got to get some width and cause the Italians some problems. The Italian defence very, very well drilled. When players are running through the middle, a little bit of brilliance from Rooney or Sturridge is fine. Swarmed round by three, four, five Italian defenders at time. England have got to spread the game, get the ball wider, and they'll only do that by getting their full backs further up the pitch. Throwing goes towards Sterling, and he puts pressure on Chiellini, who heads it behind for an England corner. England equalised within two minutes of Italy taking the lead in the first half. It's five minutes since Balotelli made it 2-1 for Italy. This time, Baines doesn't take the corner. It's Stephen Gerard from the right, and Gary Cahill's on the far post. Gerard waits, and now he delivers. Swing it in, deep looking for Wayne Rooney. Skims off the head of De Rossi, England furrows down in the penalty area, it's Gary Cahill, ball still in play. Cahill's back in his feet, and here's Rooney. And Rooney crossed that ball, accurately as it turned out. Gerard threw, Gerard tackled well, and is behind for a goal. Stephen Gerard went down in hope, I think, rather than expectation. As the challenge came in from Palletta, it just stood his ground, got his body in the way, didn't really make a challenge, not enough in it for a penalty, nobody really appeals for it. But that's what England have got to do, they've got to get into that box, play those little balls down the sides, and go from there. Jordan Henderson complaining to the Dutch referee, but it won't change his mind, and we're going to have a change for Italy. Motta will come on, and here's that Verratti. Now, Verratti was injured leading up to the tournament, I wonder if that's a recurrence of his injury. Motta is on to Verratti, left scope, inside to Ian Dennis. It should be said quickly that the referee had an excellent view of that coming together with Stephen Gerard, but also just watch for Raheem Sterling, because when that corner was taken, he was feeling at the back of the hamstrings on both his right and left leg. That's a worry. Not least, the score lineings are worrying. England won in the 2nd, 12 minutes gone to the second half of 5-5. Now, Motta just drops alongside Pirlo in the midfield, where Verratti hit me in play. Motta back now to De Rossi, and De Rossi chips it arrogantly towards the far side, I say arrogantly, what I mean, he chipped it really well, knew exactly what he was doing. Fine, Keenini, back to Pirlo. Pirlo followed De Balotelli once again. Balotelli is offside, and it's a pre-kick to England. England's got to settle themselves down now. See what the next five or six minutes brings. If they can stop Italy down this, or their left-hand side, Italy's right-hand side, and then really they've got to try and attack a little bit more with a little bit more purpose, because England had some half chances, but Sirigou pretty much untroubled, and this has been long-distance shots. Rooney Fawes, Keenini in the far side of the field, no significant harm done. I was just thinking, Danny, if there was going to be an England change, and it appears that Ross Barkley will be coming on. No, interesting who he takes off. I mean, if Sterling's got a problem, it'll be Sterling. Anyway, Italy on the attack, Darmien down the right side, the pass wasn't accurate, Baines gets there, and Baines clears for England. High towards Welbeck. Welbeck takes it on the chase, but loses possession, not before he was fouled. Free kick to England. Cesare Frandelli, he's been obviously in the technical area quite a lot tonight, and I just haven't seen Roy Hudson. Maybe he's been out there and I haven't noticed him. From the free kick, Sterling down the left side, and a short down, still gets the cross in. Sterling can't control it, and it's behind for a goal kick. Barkley's coming on, but who for? Not quite sure. Bruni possibly, but if he said it, if Sterling has got a little bit of an injury, maybe taking him off. I think Roy Hudson's been very, very positive so far. I think you can't blame Roy Hudson for really anything that's gone wrong. He's caught out down this left-hand side, he tried to address it with Danny Welbeck, and that's down to players. Players have to be responsible. Once they've been given instructions, they have to do as they're told, and they haven't done that, and that's why they find themselves two-one-done. I mean, look at both Italian fullbacks. They're pushing forward, aren't they? They're really pressing on the England defence, like Guilini is doing now from Pirlo's pass, and it's back to Pirlo on the halfway line, left of the centre-circle, onto Mottam, the substitute. Pirlo again. It's the Italian fans that you're hearing seeing the moment inside the Arena, Amazonia. Not 40,000 in there tonight. Lots of empty seats, but still a wonderful spectacle. Darmine down the right side. More or less given up defending to Mottam. Mottam now from Pirlo's pass. I know the cross-entrance in the airport. Goodness gracious, Ballotelli almost got there, but it's safely through the Juha. Any sort of touch from Ballotelli, that was in the back of the net. Italy, again, down this right-hand, or their right-hand side, now the left-hand side. Just interesting, Stirling's now come out to this left-hand side. I wonder if they're going to use that and leave him on and keep the pace on this left to try and push Marati back. Henderson to Rune, who's mainly done the right side during this second half. Into Henderson again. Rune wants more, good ball into Sturridge. 30 yards of goal. Sturridge moves forward towards the D of the Italian penalty. Should knock that far wide. Just scooped it slightly, had the right idea. Went to go back across himself. It's Welbeck who's coming off. Well, that'll be interesting to see now who comes out to this left-hand side. I think it might be Stirling. Stirling comes to this left-hand side. He will try and push the full-back Damian back, because that's where the problems are coming from. Can Drave have been very, very clever, playing in a little pocket in between, just in front of Leighton-Baines. He doesn't want to come and mark him. And then, of course, you've got the overlapping full-back. Barkley is good. He's got to... He's in the centre. Stirling out on the left-hand side. Again, you have to say, positive changes from Roy Hudson. He's doing everything he possibly can. England trail 2-1. Ian Genesis, big side. Yes, Alan, just quickly. I thought Gary Neville was trying to get Wayne Rooney to come over towards that side. But as it is, it's now Stirling who's playing on the England left. But I thought the way that Gary Neville was trying to gesture to Wayne Rooney that they wanted him to go back out on that left-hand side. Not so at the moment. Over to Stirling, the England goal scorer. He's done the right for England. Stirling checks one way, then the other, beats the defender for the third time. Still hasn't got the cross in. Slifts the pass back to Henderson. 30 yards from goal, cross into the penalty area towards Wayne Rooney. Headed clear by the Italian defence. Baines picks it up into Rooney, rugby unlock. Rooney shoots wide! Oh, dear watchers! Great opportunity for Wayne Rooney. Roy Hudson, just sitting on a monster, throws his hands to his head. He's definitely on side. He's trying to push up, but got it wrong. He did the keeper with the eyes. Everyone thought he was going to try and bend it in the far post. Cut the ball back on himself towards the near and missed by about a foot. On target and that was in because the goalkeeper had gone the opposite way. Wayne Rooney yet to score in a World Cup finals. England won Italy 2 here in Manassu. We've already played 17 minutes of the second half. The temperature is fine considering the horrific forecast that we have. Henderson, such an obvious poll to storage. He was easily intercepted and here's Mota in the centre circle. De Pirlo back to De Rossi. De Pirlo again, it looks as if De Rossi had put him in trouble. Pirlo just found little urgency, kept the ball for Italy. Mota to Marcazio, score of the first Italian goal. On to the right side in Damien. Back once more to Candreva. Up towards the right of the penalty area. The England penalty area checks onto his left foot. Won't cross, but he dinks it back to De Rossi. That's a good pass. De Rossi, 30 yards out. Chips it into the penalty area. Blocked down under control, the shot by Damien, blocked by the defender. And Rooney can clear. An England can counterattack here. Henderson, surges forward into the centre circle. Slip the ball to Barclay, down the left. Sterling is inside the penalty area. Soto is Henderson. Barclay moves inside the box. Barclay shoots, simple save for the goalkeeper. He made a bit of a hash of it though. Only pushes it wide. Sterling is there. Sterling in the penalty area again. Right side, trying to create room for the cross for Sterridge. Hicks the defender and it's opening the goal. Well, at one end we have Italy with this tactic. They are definitely employing, which is to try and dink balls over top of the England defence for players running through. I think Sterling has gone down on the far side with Kramp. By the looks of it, it's Marchizio and Kealini actually helping him out. Very, very sporty for Italians. Not like them, but at the other end, Barclay, just as he cut in from the left-hand side, I think he just caught the ground a little bit. Saw a lot of sand flick up as he shot, not quite clean, but now I think it's going to be experienced Italian defence against a youthful enterprise in England attack. Sterling is receiving some treatment. Let's go pitch side, Nian Dennis. Yeah, it was Marchizio and Kealini who, first of all, applied the treatment. It looks like Kramp are trying to bend those toes back of those luminous orange boots of Raheem Sterling, who actually is in a lot of pain. He's actually covering up his face with his shirt. Previously, of course, he had been feeling the effects of what looked like his hamstring. Just to say as well, the England player is now taking on a drinks break at this opportunity. And Ross Barclay has finally got the instruction that I'd mentioned from Gary Neville. So, Reign Rooney is playing on the left, Barclay in a central position and Sterling on the England right. And Sterling now is back on his feet. Alan? Sterling has to leave the field of play, of course, having received treatment, but he'll be the right-sided player of the three behind Sterridge in the remaining 25 minutes of the game. You're listening to five live in the BBC, 20 minutes gone in the second half. England won 8-0-2. He's got a lead through Marquesio, within two minutes, Sterridge in equalised, and then five minutes after the half-time interval, Balotelli with a simple unmarked header at the far post, restored Italy's advantage. Sterling is now back on the pitch. The game has resumed. And the ball is with Stephen Jarrod inside the centre circle. Whip pass to the left side to Baines, into Rooney. Barclay makes a run forward. Rooney passes wide, though, to Sterling. And the ball is accurate from Wayne Rooney. Sterling controls it. Back to Glenn Johnson. Johnson to Henderson. Henderson with Barclay available. Barclay static for the moment, but the pass goes to him anyway, and Barclay slips it wide to Sterling. Down the far side, England needs some pace urgently. Sterling beats one defender. His pass is going under the penalty chair, so it's easily knocked away by Fletcher behind for a corner. England has got to gamble a little bit more. When those crosses are going to the box, at the moment, there's really only one player, one white shirt in that area. People have got to gamble, run across the face of people. You might not always get the ball yourself, but it draws the attention of the other defenders. Baines to take the corner from the right. He'll hit it left footed. When he's happy, he places the ball in the quadrant now. Cahill is up inside the penalty area. Jarrod is there. Here it comes from Baines. Deep, and it's an easy catch for Sidergoo, the Italian goalkeeper. I'll say again, our set piece has been poor from England. We saw them, obviously, at Wembley, where they did incredibly well from set pieces, got a couple of goals, but this evening, delivery hasn't been good enough. Bellatelli from Pirlo's pass on the halfway line into the England half, and passes backwards to Chiellini. He exchanges passes with Fletcher. If he are happy, no, just slow things down. All the talk was about Pirlo, wasn't it? He was going to control the game, and it's actually been Camdreva down this right-hand side, along with Damien. We've caused all the problems and Ballaté's hitter. Pirlo has been good, but nowhere near what we thought he would be. It's with Fletcher. Fletcher sweeps it towards the near side. Damien controls the ball, down off his right thigh, into De Rossi. And England, wow. I'm just wondering if the heat is getting to them a little bit now. There's no excuse, having realistically. Italy, I've got to deal with the same conditions. It's not as hot and humid as we possibly expected. Yes, it will be energies happening. When you don't have the ball, it does make it doubly difficult. We'll go back to Ian Jenison after that, we'll be making. Just quickly, Jack Wil... Jack Wilsh was going through an extended warm-up behind the goal here. So I think that we've already seen you off-parking. Jack Wilsh may well be the next England player to be brought on in the next few minutes. Italy 2, England 1, and, you know, there's been quite a lot to admire about England tonight going forward, but it's the older Killy's heel, I'm afraid. There's always going to be a problem at this highest level, whether they would be able to defend well enough. But they've certainly shown more enterprise going forward. They've had plenty of shots at the Italian goal, and there is still time to get something from this game. Gerard now looking for Sterling over on the far side, and Sterling's there with the possession. Barkley makes a move. Sterling now, can he dink this one in, though he can't get past Killy? And of course, one of the problems with Sterling is he missed out on that final preparation going in the heat in Miami. So he is feeling the heat. He could be getting a yellow card here, I think. Might be the first of the game. It could be Gary Cahill, and the referees just... I'll be interested to what our callers think. They can phone in, obviously, 0-500-996-95, or text 85058. You know, all the talk is about bring the youth, bring the young players to this tournament. I said all along, if you want to do well in this tournament, I would have brought John Terry. I would implored to try and drag him out of retirement. Spain of the night suffered massively because of Poyol was missing. You know, they got exposed hugely. Experiencing that centre-half area is absolutely vital. I'd have brought Ashley Cull. Not saying letting Bainters play badly, but Ashley Cull's experience might have been able to deal with it slightly different. So England got to lose this. We'd love to hear what all the fans watching back home have got to say. 0-500-909-693-85058 on the text. Gary Cahill didn't get a yellow card, so England now at walking pace, just inside the Italian half. The ball is left to Henderson. It's 2-1 to Italy. Italy, for the most part, in the second half, have been playing on the counter-attack. It's now Johnson running towards the area, a very congested area, and nothing at the end of it from Johnson. He just ran into a blue tunnel there, and Italy looking to clear a chip from Marquisio, which Gerrard intercepts, and now Phil Jagi Elker inside the Italian half, onto Runi. Runi's got four Italian players with him. Runi now releases the ball square for Jordan Henderson, Sterling available down the right-hand side. Sturridge and Runi in the area, 2-1 to Italy on five-line. Johnson, all given away by Johnson, but not cleared by Italy. Henderson has a chance. Gerrard, the captain's calling for it. Jenderson, because Gerrard could see Sterling in space. Instead, gives it to Johnson. But the Italians have got everybody back, as England try and release Sterling in the area and win a corner kick in the end of Caletta, a corner to England now. Danny Mills has been saying that we will be going pitchside to Ian Danyson and Mellon, but England have a corner. Got to make better delivery. That's been a problem. The delivery hasn't been good enough in so far, and England, they've struggled. They're so congested in that middle area. The Italian defence, so well-drilled, well-organised, individually very, very good as well. England just have to move the ball maybe a little bit quicker, get it wider a little bit earlier, and maybe get some crosses in. We're going to have a couple of substitutions. I'm not sure if they'll make this before the corner. They don't normally, so we'll have this corner kicked to England over on the far side, which Baines will take, and then we'll have an Italian substitution and also an England substitution. Jack Wilshire coming on in the moment. Corner to England, two-one, they trail. And it goes headed on at the near post by Gary Cahill, and they've got another corner. So Baines is still over there preparing to take this corner. And he's got a little bit of a lead on the heel at the near post, trying his luck. The Italians just holding on to Rooney at the moment as he stands in front of the goalkeeper. There's no space down there at all. So, corner to England, taken short. Baines now, can he cut this one in from the right-hand side? He's given it to Glenn Johnson. Johnson takes the shot, and it's wide, and here's Ian Dennis' pitch side. Jack Wilshire on in the third substitution. Mike is likely to be Adam Lallard, because he's now going through that same extensive warm-up with the goal that I'm sat behind. And this is going to be a regular feature for England at the World Cup throughout this tournament. Pitch side on five-live, giving you all the insight as the game goes on. Well, the Italian substitution will be made first, and they have shown them... Yes, Ballatelli, who scored the second goal, is coming off. And he will be replaced by Immobili of Torino, who is the top scorer in Serie A last season with 22 goals. So he comes on. He's number 17. Jack Wilshire, number seven, preparing to come on for England and to replace Jordan Henderson, Danny. Well, I think Ballatelli, apart from his goal, hasn't done an awful lot. He's held the ball up well at times. It hasn't caused too many problems for England, but they're just putting on a strike with fresh legs. Obviously, Wilshire coming on is probably going to play a little bit more forward than Jordan Henderson, and they'll be looking to him to play those little balls through. Similar, I expect, that they expect Pirlo to do. Get the ball, dink it over the defence, maybe play little slide-rule balls down the sides of defenders for those England players to run onto. Sunday morning now back home. It's half past seven in the evening here in the Nauce. We have 17 minutes to go. It's 2-1 to Italy. They went in front through Marquisio. England equalised two minutes later from Sturridge, and in the second half, Ballatelli has headed in. The second Italian goal, and in the aftermath of the England goal and the celebrations, Gary Lewin, the physiotherapist, was injured, and we understand has a suspected broken ankle and was carried off on a stretcher. Now, Stephen Geroff-Ringel onto Jack Wilshire, his first touch. Wilshire now to Baines, and Stirling, I think, has pulled up over on the far side. England can make one more change. That pass from Jagie Elka was almost under hit, and it's a very slow pace about the game now. Not surprisingly, after the heat earlier on. Long one now from Geroff, seeking out Baines down below us. Layton Baines with a couple of Italians breathing down his neck, finds Jack Wilshire, Barclays offering himself, and it goes from Wilshire to Barclay. Barclay now square ball to Geroff. Stirling is wide on the right. Sturridge is moving around. The ball goes to Johnson, now onto Raheem Stirling. Stirling faced by Marquisio, and now all the Italian players now are back behind the ball. It's going to be very difficult for England here to open them up. Wilshire again onto Stirling. The Italians all under line now waiting for this ball to come in. It's Glenn Johnson, 30 yards out, drags the ball back to Jagie Elka. Now it's Rooney. England trying to go forward, but a great blue wall in the way. Baines now for England, 2-1, they trail here. Oh, Baines has given that away almost, but Jagie Elka is going to help him out. Jagie Elka thought about the back pass, plays it forward now to Rooney. And maybe need to put it down that far side. Stephen Gerrard's got a problem in the middle of the pitch. I don't know whether he's gone over on his ankle, whether it's cramp, he's holding his left knee ankle. He's got a problem. He hasn't moved for 30, 40 seconds now, just trying to flex his knee, I think. Ross Bartley to Glenn Johnson. Sturridge up against Keelini, that's going to be a free kick to England. Sturridge has been fouled on the edge of the penalty area. And Stephen Gerrard now is just stretching. And he's got a problem. He's got a problem. Whatever the problem, he had a sort of hamstring injury, I think it was there in the week. Certainly a groin injury, which prevented him from taking part in training in the early part of the week. But he won't want to leave the action here. But he's a terribly draining condition here for the players. England can only make one more change. We think Sterling is slightly handicapped as well. Now, Layton Baines has been given a pretty torrid night down this left-hand side defensively. Can he pop up with a free kick here? And Sturridge is limping as well, towards the penalty area. I think Sturridge just went down with cramp as well. That is down to the hot conditions. The play is not able to get on enough fluid. Well, I remember Gerrard scoring for Liverpool in the FA Cup final when he was hobbling. That dramatic 3-3 goal in Cardiff. It's Gerrard to the left of the ball, and Baines to the right. 25 yards from goal probably favours the left footer. I think it's going to have to be something very special to beat Syragoo from this distance. Gerrard is walking away, and it will be left to Everton's left back, Layton Baines. Can he get this one over the wall and get England back into the game? They're trailing 2-1. Here goes Baines. Oh, good save by the goalkeeper, Syragoo. Turns it away for a corner kick to the far side. Baines denied by the Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper, the deputy for Buffon, who's done very well this evening. And it's a corner to England over on the far side. Baines gets back into his defensive position now. England need a goal from somewhere. Can they knock one in now from the corner? Oh, it's a terrible, terrible corner from Rooney. He just scoos away behind the goal for a... A goal kick to Italy. You've talked about the set pieces tonight, Donny, but that was the worst of all. Yeah, that was a little bit unfortunate. It's standing for his left foot, just gave way as he went to kick that. Nothing he can do about that. Remember David Beckham's penalty course when he stepped a big turf came up. It was similar to that. Nothing Wayne Rooney could have done that. The set pieces and delivery hasn't been good enough this evening. England players feeling the heat, trailing 2-1 to Italy, and chasing the game is going to be difficult in these last 30 minutes on five-live. De Rossi hasn't strayed very far forward this evening. De Rossi down the centre, touched off by Marquisio. Now here's Mota. Mota. And here's the danger man down this right-hand side, Damian. They now have, immobilise, of course, in the penalty area. Anatoly having been replaced. Italy just playing it short. Mota. Brazilian born. And playing in this Brazilian World Cup for Italy. We're going to have another change in the moment for Italy. As Jaguilca slides the ball out of defence, and Sterling now tries to set off against Keelini. It goes to Sturridge. Oh, Sturridge plays that back to Glenn Johnson. He didn't seem to be expecting it. Johnson's now being hustled by immobilise. Johnson now, down the right-hand side of the field. He needs support. There's nobody with him at all. Gets the call in the end from Wilshire. And England build from the back from Steven Gerrard is trying to run off this injury that we think he's picked up. England now with Bains. Another Italian change coming in just a moment. That'll be their third and final change. Wilshire just inside the Italy half, and time starting to run us a dreadful ball to the far side towards Glenn Johnson, and England are flagging here. Back to Ian Dennis' pitchside. And as we predicted from our pitchside position, Adam Milana is about to come on for England, and that will be England's third and final substitution. Mike. Thank you. Perolo will also come on for Italy, and England will be really pleased to see the back of this guy. Can Draver, who's had a really excellent match, he's tormented England down the right-hand side. So he's walking off Antonio Can Draver, and he'll be replaced by another relatively inexperienced player, Perolo. And England's final change then will be Adam Milana coming on. Surely it has to be... It's not Sterling, it's Sturridge coming off. We think that Sterling's got a problem, but maybe it's Sturridge now who's... He's jogging off quite gingerly, isn't he? He did go down with a cramp after that foul. Maybe, you know, he's just given way inside of the... He can't carry on, but that's a blow for England, because, you know, he is one of our hottest, brighter strikers. Scored a great goal on the half volley to make it 1-1 in the first half, two minutes after England have gone behind. England do at least have impact players to bring on Langler-Larner and Barclay and Walsher. And now Perolo gets his first touch for it. 2-1, they lead here, and we're starting to run out of time. There's over 10 minutes to go. Italy now with Damian down the right-hand side. Immobilise calling for it. Goes to Marquisio. Marquisio's ball in should be cleared by Giancarlo. He's taking his time. Now finds Sterling over on the right-hand side. Don't forget you'll be able to hear all the follow-ups to this game tonight on Gary Richardson's Sports Week tomorrow morning. He's got Harry Rednap on the program. He's got Ray Clements, the former England goalkeeper, and also at the moment the man who's going to be happiest of all, Roberto Di Matteo. So that's Sports Week with Gary Richardson on five-live later today. Of course, it's now Sunday. And here's Layton Baines, wide on the England left. Rooney's now playing down the centre. He's played wide right, wide left. He's now down the centre. Barclay over to Raheem Sterling. Johnson on the overlap. Rooney's waiting in the area. And it's a terrible ball from Johnson. It's the end product once again that's missing from that right back. And just when Roy Hodgeson looked at his face, he looked so downbeat in that moment. That was a good chance for England to trouble the Italian defenders. Just seeing the attendance flash up. 39,000, I think the stadium holds 42, so not a bad turnout here in the heat this evening. But again, I just like to, you know, the lines are open. 0500, 999, 693. Would really like to hear, you know, what England fans make of this performance. You know, I think Roy Hodgeson has done pretty much everything he possibly can. You know, he's changed it tactically. He's been attacking. He's given the young players a chance. But what has been the difference? What do England fans think the difference between these two sides has been? Well, for me, it's been the difference that I must admit. I think we all anticipated that when it came to the very highest level, would England be able to defend well enough without John Terry, without Ashley Cole now? And, well, they've been found wanting, and the Italians have put better delivery in as well. I mean, compare that Glenn Johnson delivery with some of the Italian balls from the right-hand side. But there's still time. England trailing 2-1. But they have to do something quickly here. Barclay now with his great body strength going forward, and then he's going to overrun that and take on too many Italians. And the Italians, how ambitious will they be now as they counterattack? They know they lead 2-1. They're going to go globally now, and the England are stretched. England don't have enough defenders back, but that's gone off Gary Cahill. And Joe Hart intercepts, but hey, we're almost stranded there, Danny. Nearly got caught on the counterattack. England pushing forward now, taking a little bit of a chance. Interesting. You just mentioned Pirlo. He's the first time you've mentioned him in maybe 10 minutes. He's hardly touched the ball. No, he hasn't dominated the game in the way that he did two years ago. But other Italians have really caught the eye this evening. Baratti was on the pitch, looked good, and he's probably the most eye-catching combination, Damian and Candreva, relatively unknown players down the Italian right. Now, here comes Raheem Sterling, who started the game behind Sterridge. Sterling is well-guarded, though, by Tirolo. Sterling tries to dink the ball in, and again, it's another disappointing cross from the right. Nothing for Rooney to feed off. Or Barclay, it's an Italian goal kick, and they're taking plenty of time, of course, over this. We have 8 minutes to go, and Italy, despite their desperate build-up, they didn't win a single friendly game after World Cup qualification, and they were held 1-1 by Luxembourg in their last game before the World Cup. Come the tournament, and nearly always get it right. And at the moment, they're heading for three points to join Costa Rica, and it may be that they'll have to win both of their remaining matches to qualify. It's going to make it very, very difficult now, isn't it? Very, very tough, but as we said, the Italian is very, very experienced. We know how good they are when it comes to tournament football. England now, I think it's Gary Kay, he'll gone down on the far side with Cramp. Well, they're suffering much more than the Italians. Well, this is what I don't understand. I've just looked at the statistics. This is 52% possession in favour of the Italians. So not massively different. The Italian team, I believe, are based in the south, right down in the south as well, where it's much, much cooler. I think all three Italian games are up in the north, so they will have problems. The Italian players are older, pretty much, you know, than the England players. And we've had five or six England players go down with Cramp and are struggling. Didn't we call any Italian? No, there isn't. As we said, not one Italian has gone down so far. Italy two, England one on five live in this opening game of the World Cup. All is not lost, but there are still two more matches to go, but England now would love an equaliser. As Lallana is clattered on the edge of the area. Now then, if England have a way back here, it has to be pretty soon. We've got six minutes to go. This free kick, Rooney's grabbed the ball already. Baines is there as well. Gerard might lurk as well. He's got a fantastic shot, obviously. But England so far this evening with their set pieces, in particular their corners have been disappointing. But can they strike this one past Sirigou? Trailing two-one with around about six minutes to go. Rooney's in the centre of the three at the moment. I think Gerard might strike this. David Fome has gone down by the ball, which was instantly rubbed away by Steven Gerard. Could this be the big moment for the captain, Gerard? He's scored at two previous World Cups. He's certainly having a long look at this ball. Baines is there just to try and confuse the Italian defenders. There's a little bit of manhandling going on. It's well in the penalty area. Lallana's being grabbed around, but now Gerard concentrates. And Gerard takes it, it's over the bar. It just would not come down for him. Well struck, almost two. Just not quite good enough. It ended up in the middle of the guy. I think had it been low enough, I think Sirigou might have had that one covered. And I'm pretty sure now the Italians are going to play for time. England's starting to look tired, looking weary. You know, players physically absolutely exhausted. They've done well in points. They're one of the first half, got back in the game very, very quickly. But they haven't been able to cope with this threat down. Italy's right-hand side, England's left-hand side. That has been the problem all night long. Roy Hodgson, I believe, did his best. You know, changed the tactics, has changed personnel, but still it hasn't worked. And that's why I like to hear the call as 0-500-996-93 to what they think of Roy Hodgson's selections. Here's Johnson again giving the ball away, not decisive enough. That was an obvious pass to Runi, and it was under hit as well. It wasn't played with conviction. And it opens up England again now potentially, as Immobilie has it. Immobilie now, across to this near side, this dangerous right-hand side, but they switch the ball back to Barzagli in defence. The goal which may decide this game, scored by Mario Ballatelli, whose future is very uncertain in Italy, when they see Milan. Perolo now looking for one for Immobilie to chase, but it's offside. And England have a free kick. And there is nothing like the pace of the game earlier on here this evening. There's two sides that run themselves into the ground, but it looks like at the moment Italy are going to collect the three valuable points. Big difference is the two left-back areas. You know, Leighton-Baines has been exposed, two-on-one, not all of his own doing. They're going to turn from Ross Barclay in the meantime. Ross Barclay still moving towards the penalty area, very congested. Runi takes over, and it's a terrible strike in the end for Runi. He got right underneath it and lifts the ball into the England fans. He had a great chance as well, did Runi in the second half, which he put wide. It's another goal kick, another opportunity, away for England. Wainwright is just trying a little bit too hard, but go back to that. The two left-backs, Keelini has not been exposed once, not the quickest, but nobody really has got the ball and run at him. Yes, he's a very, very good defender, playing out of position at left-back, but no one's trying to expose him at all. Well, at least it will be cooler at the other two venues for the Uruguay game in Sattalo, the Costa Rica game in Vela Horizonte, and now England with Adam Lallano. They made all their three changes. Here's another of the substitutes, Jack Walsh. Walsh to Gerard. All the Italians filtering back once more to make life incredibly difficult here for England. Gerard now to the far side of the field and Johnson. Now can Johnson provide something here, but it's a walking pace. Sterling is pointing. It's absolute walking pace here. This isn't going to open up the Italians. Sterling again into Barclay. It's going to take something pretty special. Ross Barclay, little extravagant prick from Lallano. Didn't work at all and England need more than that. Ball is out of play and it's going to be an England throw. Quickly taken. We've got just over two minutes of normal time to go. As Jagi Elka finds Rumi. Two onto Italy on five-life and Raheem Sterling. Now Sterling with a little bit of a bustle and still Sterling with a bustle. Sterling in the end and that's gone off the defender. Barclay, I think it was for a corner kick to England over on the far side. The set pieces haven't been good, but now can the captain deliver with this corner? Steven Gerard, far side of the right. Needs to be better. This is the moment that the players come up from the back. Cahill, Jagi Elka, Barclay, Rumi in there. Get this delivery right. Caused those Italian defenders all sorts of problems. Lallano and Jagi Elka and Cahill are all in the six-yard area. It's the usual scene here against the Italian defenders. A lot of shoving and in goes the corner kick. A big leap from Rumi, but the Italians will head it out of the penalty area. Comes out to Jack Wilshire. Wilshire heads it forward. England have to scramble the ball back now through Baines. It's slightly wayward from him to Johnson over on the far side. And we just have over a minute of normal time to go. Gerard for Johnson. The Italians are certainly for this now. They've got everybody back inside their own half. And of course, they are masters at denying opposition. Barclay, Barclay onto Wayne Rumi, surrounded by Italian blue. Back to Baines once more. Gary Cahill is in the penalty area. Ross Barclay again now. Barclay trying to pick up past a Sterling. Sterling up against Perla. Sterling wide and tired in the end. And that's gone wide and in this tough group for England. I think it's the first time ever in World Cup history that we have three former World Cup winners in the group. Uruguay, Italy and England. And England are starting its seams with defeat. 30 seconds to go and maybe a couple of minutes of added time. Major difference for me, Mike, is England's attack. When we've talked about this left-hand side, that's been a problem for England all night long. But there's been no real plan for England, I think, when they've gone forward. They've relied on individuals to try and come up with something. There's been no real pattern of play. Whereas Italy, clearly, they've been trying to get the ball, dink it in behind, play balls down the side of people. There was a definite plan to Italy's attack. Whereas I think England have almost said, look, they're good players individually. Just go and play and try and create something on your own, rather than have a set plan. But there's been no real time. There's five minutes of added time. As Gerard finds Adam Lallana. Well, ball from Lallana was really poor behind Jack Wilshire. And England get the possession away, and Perla with that slide-rule pass finds Mota. And it's offside against Immobilie over on the far side. Just before all that, there was a very, very tired clearance from Gary Cahill, who really seems to be laboring now with this cramped free kick to England. And it's touched off to Wilshire. And the pass from Lallana wasn't good enough. And now Leighton Baines. Baines back again to Gerard on the half-way line. Two-one to Italy, and we're playing five minutes of added time here in Manass. Now, Johnson poised down the right-hand side. And again, he fails to get past the first defender. Johnson finds Jack Wilshire. Wilshire scampers forward. Wilshire's going forward. He's partially tackled. Rooney picks up the loose ball. It may make his way to Sterling over on the far side. Now, can Sterling measure a cross hit to somebody? Not really. But he's getting a far post in the Italians' clear. That final ball from England wants more, letting them down. Baines with the throw-in and thrown down to Barclay. Barclay nudges the ball into Wilshire. That's such a congested area. Wilshire went past a couple of players, but not the third. And now, Perlowe's bringing the ball. Cahill didn't make the challenge. Perlowe again, he's just holding this, and then works it down the left-hand side. Sterling's backtracking, and that's really disappointing for England because he's got a yellow card for the foul on Perlowe. Dutch referee showing the first yellow card of the night to an England player to Raheem Sterling, and this just buys Italy more time. They weren't really going anywhere. No, they were a fair play to Raheem Sterling. He did chase back 50, 60 yards in injury time. Just tried to make it. It was a tired tackle. Just tried to put his foot out and nick the ball. Just a little bit slow, and that's down maybe to the heat and tiredness for him. England looking shattered now on their knees. They haven't been outplayed by Italy tonight, but there have been those crucial moments which have cost them. That's exactly right, Mike. There's not an England player that's played badly this evening. No one has really set the place on fire, but I think when it's come down to those big moments, Italy have just been a little bit better. Keelyne's hardly put a foot wrong at the backfritters this night. Now, De Rossi. It's not been tested, Mike. Nobody's got the ball. No one's got the ball and run it, Keelyne. He's not the most mobile. He's a fantastic defender. I think he would be brilliant in the Premier League, but no one has got the ball and run it in. They say, come on, let's have a race. He hasn't been tested all evening long, whereas Leighton Baines constantly tested, not only with it as an individual, but also with two-on-one situations as well. Well, it was a big call to leave that Ashley Cole. Baines has had quite a baptism tonight in the World Cup. Andrew Perlow has got a free kick for Italy 30 yards away. And obviously, the Italian fans in the stadium hoping that he can provide the garnish here. 3-1 would flatter them, I think, on the evening. It's a long, long way out, though. Joe Hart, who hasn't really had that much to do in the second half, waits, and Perlow shoots a goal and it clips up the crossbar. Hart was beaten. All ends up. And England rescued by the bar, and they have a goal kick, and they have a minute and a half to rescue this game. Joe Hart almost embarrassed. Unbelievable free kick from Andre Perlow. Outside of the right, but completely did Joe Hart. And at the last, the bit of swerve, Perlow knew exactly what he was doing and very, very unlucky to hit the crossbar. Last chance, maybe, now for England. Johnson into Rooney. Again, searching for his first World Cup goal. Rooney to Barclay. Good pass from Barclay to Sterling. Oh, Sterling's given that away cheaply towards Perlow. Perlow hasn't had a great header on the ball, though. Perlow heads it back to the reliable Kylini, and Perlow and Kylini closing the game out now in the left-back position. Italy leading 2-1 into the last minute of the five. Added time. Italy have the ball, and Perlow with a long pass seeks out Immobile. Gary Cahill was there, and there's precious little time to go now. England have to do something pretty miraculous. They're trailing 2-1. Adam Lallana now, in that very congested midfield. Lallana trying to turn, finds Gerard in midfield. Seconds to go now. The ball down the England right-hand side. They may get one more chance to whip this ball in. Here comes Johnson's cross. Went a long way, wasn't well delivered. Marquisio's back header is still in play. Baines needs some support down the left. He's got a throw in. We have 20 seconds of added time to go. England throw it, reared up at Lallana, and he couldn't control it, and Italy are on a break here, and this could be devastating unless England can get the players back. There's a Mowbley up against Gary Cahill. A Mowbley showing great post. Fantastic challenge of Cahill to deny a Mowbley. And I'm not sure it's going to be enough now for England. A Mowbley following an Italian throw is just taking the ball towards the corner flag. Time is up here in the Nass. We've been waiting for this for a very long time. All the attention from Roy Hunchin has been on this opening game against Italy. There was meticulous preparation in Florida, but on the night, England found Italy in the end. They were not to handle. They were exposed in areas when Italy went forward. There were some entertaining moments from England. A thrilling goal from Daniel Sturridge, but in the end it's a disappointing start to this World Cup campaign because the final score here, Italy 2, England 1. Yeah, disappointing for England. Devastating almost, but I think you have to say that the balance of play Italy probably deserved to win the game. They had the better chances. Pirlo hit the bar in injury time with a fantastic free kick. And obviously, Candreva hit the post just before half time as well. Ballatelli had one cleared off the line from Jaguilca. Nobody played bad for England, but nobody was absolutely brilliant. And England in those special moments, those defining moments of the game were just found a little bit wanting. And then there was a full-on and a full-on for the UK. It's a very, very good, but only for the left-hand side, England's struggle. It's not down to bad play from Leighton Baines. It got outnumbered two-on-one. Rooney didn't quite know where he was supposed to be in that first half. That may well have been a plan from Italy. Pirlo didn't run the game as expected. I said several times this week, don't be over-concerned with Pirlo. We don't need to worry about that. Keely didn't really go forward as much or anywhere near as much as Damian did. And Kandrej from that little pocket, that was a clear ploy. And Italy also looking to play balls in behind the England offence, flip balls over the top, whereas England were trying to rely on individual moments of magic. And that was the major difference. Let's go to Ian Dennis down in the tunnel. Yes, and at the mouth of the tunnel, the England player is just walking past me now, obviously you can see them all squirting profusely. We're going to get some reaction too from the England captain, Stephen Jeraab, because I actually think he's with Gabby Logan. He's not there yet, but that interview will be coming up very, very soon. And if I just have to hand back to you actually back in the commentary position. Thank you, Ian. I mean, England don't often win opening games in the World Cup, that happens very rarely, but they don't often lose them either. So this really is now an up-to-all task, isn't it? Uruguay next on Thursday, followed by Costa Rica, who beat Uruguay today. Well, it's now a must-win game, isn't it? It's going to be very, very difficult against Uruguay. Again, England have to win, again Uruguay have to win. So I think that the problem that will be, the problem will be, the fact that Louis Suarez is likely to play. We've seen how tired England players have been this evening. How are they going to recover? I think Ian, are we able to come to you now? Yes, sorry, Mike. I just had to speak to FIFA here in the tunnel about our after-match requests. But the players look drained as they're coming off. They look physically exhausted. Joe Hart, a lot of shirt swapping going on. Andre Perlow with his long hair, just drenched with sweat, being embraced by the goalkeeper. He's actually wearing a blue vest underneath his blue shirt. And now the England players have just branched off to the right towards their dressing room. England's first defeat in a World Cup finals in the opening game since 1986, and with Costa Rica beating Uruguay earlier on as well, they've now got it all to do. And what a crucial game it's going to be against Uruguay in Sao Paulo. But England are going to have to recover, because physically they're going to be drained from this experience. And after all the optimism and all the confidence going into this game to lose to one really will hurt them. Back to you, Hart Pugac. Thank you very much indeed, Ian. Chris Waddle with me for the next half an hour. We'll take your calls. Looking ahead specifically to the second game on Thursday night, just put it in your diary. Eight o'clock, your time, Sao Paulo against Uruguay.
