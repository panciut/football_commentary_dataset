  "transcript": " England and Scotland faster than anywhere else. Our base is Anfield, they're under way, Liverpool Southampton. Here are Chris Sutton and Ian Dennis. Thank you, Mark, just under way, Liverpool then all in red, playing from right to left, so they're defending the Cop, for those of you who know Anfield against the Southampton side in their change strip. The luminous yellow shirts and navy shorts, and I'll run through the two teams for you, where Liverpool have made just the three changes. Simacass for Robertson at left back. You've got Jones from a Callister in the midfield, and then the other change is Nunes for Jota. So, Alisson in goal, Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Kanate and Simacass, Jones Gravenberg and Subosly, Dias Nunes and Mo Salah, who's on the ball now, as he passes the ball to Alexander-Arnold, who quickly switches play to the left corner of the area, taken on the chest by Dias, ball inside. Jones with a shot away, blocked by Bednarek, who able to get the ball away. Ramstell is in goal for Southampton, they're playing with a back four, Walker-Peters, Bednarek, Harwood-Bellis and Ryan Manning, Dibbling-Smallbone, Uwe Chukwu, Fernandez-Sulimana and Grombeke complete that Saints line-up. As Doncaster-Robers lead Swindantown by a goal to Niel, Doncaster, who are looking for automatic promotion from lead two, they are already one goal up against Swindantown. Christoph? Yep, it's playing for the title against playing for Pride this afternoon. Randfield and Southampton immediately at the start of this game, they've sat in their 4-4-2 Liverpool dominating possession. Yes, if ever there was a game that constituted a home banker, it is this, with 58 points behind, between rather, the league leaders Liverpool and bottom of the table Southampton. A penalty in Dublin, James Burry. Two penalties, one for Arland from Prendergast, but immediately France respond and Thomas Ramos knocks one over from 25 metres out, three minutes to half-time, and France still lead by eight points to three, but the breaking news on Twan du Po is out of the match with injury. Commentary of that is on Sports Extra, it'll be followed by Scotland Wales at 4.45. Incidentally, next week on Sports Extra, you'll have the best possible coverage of the Cheltenham Festival from Tuesday. All 28 races will be on BBC Radio 5 Live, either on Sports Extra or 5 Live. Can't wait for that from Tuesday to Friday of next week. You won't miss a trick when it comes to the horse racing and that Cheltenham Festival from Tuesday afternoon from 1 o'clock. This, though, the Liverpool are entering the final straight, and they are well clear. 13 points, although Arsenal do have a game in hand. But Liverpool, only the three changes, not wholesale changes, that Arnav Slott making today. That was certainly the question before the game, with that Liverpool would make a lot of changes, looking ahead to huge Champions League, right here at Anfield on Tuesday against PSG. But it's one of those, I think, before the start of the season, Liverpool fans wanted to see their team win the Premier League, and they want to get the job done as quickly as possible. But Arnav Slott focusing on the task in hand, and showing respect to Sal Hanson. Goal at the stadium of line in the championship, John Bennett. Sunderland won, Cardiff City, Niel, Elisa Mayender again. He scored two in his last game, he's scored now. Awful playing out from the back from Cardiff. Sunderland won it back, Mayender made no mistake. Sunderland won, Cardiff, Niel. Bottom of the table, Derby County taking on Blackburn today. Lee Blakeman, you've seen a goal. The first goal of the John Eustice era has been scored by Craig Forsythe. Cross-in found Forsythe at the back post, beat the keeper well. Derby won Blackburn, Niel. Certainly going to be a pivotal afternoon in the Football League. We'll keep you across it, whether at the Championship League 1 or League 2, as well as focusing on the Premier League. We've also got John Southall at Brighton, Chris Coles at Crystal Palace, in the two other games in the Premier League. After earlier, Nottingham Forest beat Manchester City by a goal to Niel. Talking of Chris Coles, let's go to Selhurst Park. Lively start, still Palace, Niel, Ipswich, Niel, two big chances apiece, and Kettier well saved by Palmer and Phyllegene, forcing a good save from Henderson, Niel Niel. Savoslai outside the centre-circle, just tried to nick the ball towards Gravenburg. Southampton have it, Dibbling with his socks rolled down. The young Southampton player, Curtis Jones in field, Dias able to turn, holds off one challenge, and then it was Bednareka who went to ground and got the ball for Southampton. Dibbling then loses the ball once again, Liverpool's desire to win it back, so evident. Yes, Southampton just cannot get up the pitch at this moment in time. Liverpool smothering Southampton when they do try and play out from the back. Alexander-Arnold forward, front of the Sakenidawglesch stand, midway through the Southampton half, slides the ball in, laid back out to Gravenburg, cuts it in, here is Mo Salak, comes to Jones! Jones puts it wide. He was just inside the penalty area right footed, and that was just away from the left hand post, Niel Niel. He knows his reaction, tells you everything, Curtis Jones, he should have scored. They work it well down the right hand side, ball into Salak, pop back, and then outright, and the ball fed back to... Salak couldn't get a shot off, and the ball's prodded towards Curtis Jones from the Southampton defender. He's 12 yards out, and he's got to bury that, didn't hit the target. Pass the right hand post of Ramstail. On a slot, watching from the stands again, as he serves the second of his two-match touchline van, for his antics against Everton, that also resulted in a £70,000 fine, as we welcome listeners to the BBC World Service, to Anfield, Liverpool against Southampton, so wherever you are in the world, it's a pleasure to have your company on this Saturday afternoon. So, Niel Niel here, Niel Niel at Selhurst Park. What's the early stages like at the Amex, John Southall? Well, it's the same here, Ian Brighton Niel, full of Niel. Live, we start to the game, though, for Brighton, Matoma flying down the left-hand side, cutting his shot saved by Leno Brighton Niel, full of Niel. Jones, just beside his own half, strokes the ball back to Allyson. The performance of his life. He described his superb heroics against Paris Saint-Germain in midweek in the Champions League. We will be live here on Tuesday night for yet more... European action during the week on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds. It should be some occasion, Liverpool against Paris Saint-Germain here on Tuesday. Another goal at Derby, Lee Blakeman. Another one for Derby. Derby, two, Blackburn, Niel. Low ball in from the right, picked out Ebu Adams, scrambling the area. Adams put it in, two goals in six and a half minutes, and the bottom club, Lee Blackburn, two, Niel. There you are, bottom. They're seven points adrift, without a win in 12, but John Eustis against his old side. Setting Blackburn Rovers and their playoff aspirations with that current score line. Seven minutes played here. What have you made of the start, Chris? Well, Southampton just getting a bit of a foothold in this game, and trying to press Liverpool a bit higher up the pitch. Liverpool will build up play a little bit better than Southampton's structure at this moment in time. But from their perspective, it's a case of hanging on in there in this game. I mean, it's like getting an opportunity trying, Nick, but their season's over, isn't it, really? They're going to go down. I think they need to win something like seven or eight games, the one-two all-season Southampton. Yeah, talking of Derby County, as well as with those two goals that we've heard there in the East Midlands, Southampton will want to avoid that tag of being the worst side in Premier League history that currently is Derby County. But in fact, when Derby County muster just the 11 points in 0-7-08, like Southampton, they had nine points at this stage of the season. It's 0-0. It's the Premier League. Five live and BBC sounds also live on the World Service, as the ball is stroked by Canate out towards Alexander-Arnold in field to Gravenberg. Gravenberg, who I thought was just hobbling a fraction after a challenge earlier on, I think, with Fernandez and his persistence, it goes behind and out for a goal kick. Half-time then in Dublin, James Burridge. A monster penalty from Sam Prendergast from 50 metres, brings Arland to within two. Eight points to six. France lead at half-time. Bielbari with a try, low and Antoine Dupont out. Mentioned the second half will be on Sports Extra. Also talked about the Cheltenham Festival on Sports Extra. India, New Zealand in the Champions Trophy cricket final tomorrow. Nine o'clock, the coverage will start. That too will be on Sports Extra. As Ram Steyl, away towards our left with a goal kick, bounces away off at Dibbling, tries to win it back, succeeds, then gives it and shows too much to Simicast. And now Gravenberg will play it short, then in field, Canate, just stands on the ball and plays it back towards Gravenberg, who is coming forward now outside the centre-circle, along the ground towards Simicast. Look for that ball over the top four, Diaz to chase. Harwood Bellis will try and get there and did just about get there, and Diaz has gone crashing into the advertising hoardings and might have taken a blow to the head. Yeah. That looks to be a really sore one for Diaz. Tried to keep the ball in play. Harwood Bellis made the challenge and then it's a follow-through. As he slides down a little incline and he hammers his head into the advertising boards. I'm seeing that again. That's a... Just hope he's all right, really. There's some clatter to his head. I said Harwood Bellis, it was actually bad and direct, my apologies. But Diaz is back on his feet. Supporters singing his name here inside Anfield. It remains 0-0, 10 minutes played between Liverpool and Southampton. So a corner kick for the league leaders, that Alexander-Ranould is going to take on this near side. At the Anfield road end of the ground, half of that bottom tier allocates it to the Saints supporters and they've packed it too. In it comes now and then headed out on this occasion by Harwood Bellis. But they're played out by Simicast that forces Gravenburg out very, very wide and he can't keep the ball in place. Southampton throw. And do you know what, from Southampton's point of view, Ian, it's been a health thing, they've had a pretty decent start here. There was a chance for Curtis Jones, but they just, I don't think, 10 minutes on the clock and kept it at a nil so far, they'll try and gain little victories in this game early on and not give away a cheap goal. If Liverpool need to score a goal, it'll have to be a moment of quality, a moment of brilliance and have to defend set-piece as well. And then try and carry a threat of their own eventually. They've lost their last six league visits with an aggregate scoreline of 19 goals to one. In fact, it was 2013, the last time that Southampton won here and it was the former Liverpool player. He went on to the play for Liverpool, Dayan Lovren, who got the goal for Saints that day. Bristol Robersley had us feel down by a goal to a late Norian, nil Northampton, down one, a latest scores in league one. In the Premier League, it's still nil-nil here, top against bottom. Gravenburg out towards Alexander Radell, who slowly passes the ball to Mo Salah, running at Manning. Level the area, Manning gets a foot into the challenge and his right foot forces the ball out of play for a throw. He dealt with it well there, Manning. First 1v1 for Mo Salah, driving. Trying to get on the outside. Just a little bit slow now from Liverpool, with their passing, lacking a little bit of pace and that allows Southampton to get back into their shape and their positioning and make it difficult to play through. Dias flicks the ball in field, reaches Gravenburg. 30 yards out from goal, short forward ball back towards Dias, runs into trouble, manages to nick it towards Savoslai, helps it on its way out towards Salah. Still 25 yards out, forward ball, Ukechukul headed away, Dibbling has Simakas snapping at his heels, but again, Jones, those desire levels for Liverpool to win the ball back so quickly. And Dibbling has been unfortunate because he must have lost it about four or five times already the Southampton youngster. He's the one, isn't he, Dibbling, where you think, if Southampton want to get up the pitch, he is a dribbler, he is a ball carrier. Interesting the way they've set up there. You know, in a 4-4-2, going back and it has Fernandez playing furthest forward, but they're set up to contain and frustrate and that's what they have done in these early stages. There's been a goal at Ashton Gate in the championship, Bristol City have fallen behind, Bristol City, Neal Hall City won. Details of that goal from Oanguina. Well taken goal by Jal Pedro, a lovely turn in the box by the centre forward, centre back Rob Dickey, slipping Pedro, side-fussing past the keeper, his sixth of the season, Hall City, a goal ahead, Bristol, Neal Hall City won. Thank you, Oanguina, early on in the championship, Coventry City beat Stoke City by three goals to two, Southampton almost getting caught out by playing it out from the back, but they get away with it. Ramsdale's forward ball can't release Sulamana, Watford 1-0, wall two was the result at Dickey, which was right. That was like the old Russell Martin ball, wasn't it? Did just get away with it, small-bone under real pressure, and the ball eventually going back to Ramsdale, who hoofed the ball clear. Liverpool so good with the press, they're on to Southampton. Here is small-bone, runs it forward, shows too much to Canate, slides in, wins the ball, Van Dyke, a former Southampton player, of course, Jones came under pressure from Ugochukwu. Canate then passes the ball out to Gravenberg, who's out towards that right touch line, bypasses Alexander-Arnold on both occasions, the two players, as it's back with Canate. Alexander-Arnold again wants it now and gets it, and his forward ball looks for the run of Nunes, and then two Southampton players collide. That was Manning coming in, and it was also going to be Bednarek, and they've clashed heads and they've both gone down. That's an absolute sickness, and there's concern here for both players, eyes on the ball, both of them, and then they clash heads, and I've got to say Bednarek, looks like Manning is okay. Bednarek is down in a pretty awkward position there, let's just hope he's all right. Yep, Manning has set up, but Bednarek is still flat out at the moment. There's now been ascending off at Ashton Gate, oh, and... Goal score to Jal Pedro has received a red card, landing in on George Tanner, late referee can run across, brandished the red card, whole city, a goal ahead, up to 10 men, Jal Pedro off the field. Manning is onto his feet now, he looks okay, Bednarek is still being treated, and they're taking quite rightly the due care and attention of two physios, they're just holding the head and talking to Jan Bednarek. Brarrow leading Ackrington, Stanley by a goal to Nill, we've got a lengthy stoppage then here at Anfield, we will go to Crystal Palace against Ipswich Town and Chris Coles. Which is still 0-0, 15 minutes old, but Crystal Palace just beginning to stamp their authority on this game, a couple of decent chances, Jefferson Lerma, shot from the edge of the area, well found by Munoz, Lerma, fraction of space, right foot shot, just dragged it a couple of yards wide of the left hand posed. Palace, Nill, Ipswich, Nill. Still Brighton and Hove Alvian, Nill, full of Nill, earlier at the City Ground, Nottingham Forest Peak Manchester City, by a goal to Nill, we know that fourth place Sunderland, a leading Cardiff City, by a goal to Nill, they've got Burnley and Sheffield United above them, at Bramble Lane, it's Julia Vald. Yes, it is still Sheffield United Nill, Preston Nill, we have 17 minutes gone, but lots of early pressure from Sheffield United, Tyrese Campbell's early shot, hit the side netting, but still goalless at Bramble Lane. Plymouth have fallen behind, Plymouth next to bottom, without a win in four, Sheffield Wednesday have just taken the lead, and Bellacockchap is going to be coming on, because Bednarak at least is sitting up now, Chris Surton, which is always a relief. Yes, absolutely, but they shouldn't take any risks with head knocks, and that looks a pretty severe one, so Bellacockchap will come on, like for like. And I mentioned that goal at home park, here's John Akerz. Plymouth, Nill, Sheffield Wednesday, one, an own goal from Alkbetter, cross from the left, he just didn't deal with it, came off his shins and went in, our goal had started well, but they're behind, Plymouth Nill Wednesday won. Well, the stretcher was ready, and it was poised by the four gentlemen who were willing to carry it, but Bednarak is on his feet, but he's not going to be in a position to continue, as we will go to London Road in League One, where there's been a goal, Adam Whitty. And it's gone to Peterborough, they lead one Nill over Wickham, League Mother Sill with a calm and composed penalty, his 14th of the season, it is Peterborough One, Wickham Nill with 14 minutes gone. Jan Bednarak started to walk, and then he stops, and put his hands on his knees, he really isn't a bad way. It's not a good look, and it's not worth us speculating, but with a blow like that, and the way that he's stooped in, as he listened to the evasion he's getting, but there'll be some sort of concussion in there, how severe it is, anything is as it takes time to recover. Well, he's getting a nice ovation from the Anfield crowd, as well as the travelling support, Jan Bednarak, the Southampton captain, forced off the field of play, and it means that Bellacoccia, the German defender, will come on to replace him in the heart of that Saints back line. So that was a good four-minute-five-minute stoppage here at Anfield, where it remains nil-nil, and Southampton forced into that change, and there will be a drop ball for Aaron Ramsdale, as play is going to get underway here, and Ramsdale will just touch it back into his penalty area, and then pick the ball up, and allow those luminous shirts of Southampton's change strip to move further forward as they attack the Cop End, but it's an extremely high line from Liverpool who are all in red. And then Ramsdale gets good distance on that. Silamano was making the run in behind Canate, and Alexander-Arnold tried to usher it out for a... He's actually kept... Didn't keep the ball in play. No, and I can't believe he didn't really... Really casual defending. He had time to get back and clear the ball out for a throw into Southampton. Of course, this allows Southampton to put a corner into... the Liverpool box and try and cause them a problem or two, but defending really slack from Alexander-Arnold. Keen to usher it out for a goal kick, got a touch, and by that point he'd conceded a corner that Smallbone's going to take in front of the Cop, far side the left, nil-nil. It's an in-swinger, and Harwood Ballet's got something on it, six yards out, but didn't have the power, and after his exertions in Paris in midweek, that was a comfortable save by Allyson. But that stoppage in play, you can feel that there's been that lol and the crowd then just tried to raise Liverpool as 20 minutes played, it remains nil-nil. And really, the only scare to Southampton goal was that one from Jones that he put wide. There's a clear cut opportunity, but the most important thing is Liverpool keep moving the ball quickly, real purpose and pace to the passing, and they have just slackened off. Here is Salah. Salah on the right-hand side, Sir Boss Lyle looks for a return ball to Salah, tried to cut back inside onto his left foot. Smallbone was there to clear the ball out of play. It's a Liverpool throw level, the penalty area on the right-hand side, five-live. BBC sounds and we're also live on the World Service. Where it remains nil-nil. Lutentown are down to 10-men. Naismith has been sent off, they're currently drawing away at Burnley. Nil-nil remains at Turf Moor, but third place Burnley and beaten in 22 games. And Lutentown struggling third from bottom, and now down to 10 after that second bookable offense for K Naismith. As here is Sir Boss Lyle over the halfway line. Graven Birx ahead of him, but he's come to a standstill. Chris, certainly quite rightly said, the tempo at times can be a little bit slow from the league leaders, as Van Dijk to Jones. They've certainly been quick to win it back, however, when they've not had the ball, here is Diaz, shown on the inside by Walker-Peters. They doubled up on this left-hand side, they lose it, dibbling on the Southampton right, Ukechukwu now to Walker-Peters, passes the ball in field, laid off by Fernandez, Smallbone, nicely done, and worked out now by Grombe, out towards Sulimana. Southampton are attacking, Sulimana enters the penalty area, goes past one challenge, Alexander-Arnold comes through to the corner, Mill Nill. Yeah, brilliant from Southampton, actually, from deep in their own half, all the way up the pitch, Switcher played to Sulimana, who drives on the inside, and Alexander-Arnold's had to stay alert inside his own box. Smallbone, once again to Whippa Corner, and Liverpool will be keen on this occasion to get that first contact. Smallbone then places the ball down, it's another corner kick on that far side to the left, as Southampton played from left to right, attacking the cop. Midway through the first half, Smallbone, another in-swinger, met by Nunez, comes out to Grombe, hit then by Fernandez, and then Allison with the save, and he looks for that long ball over the top, as the Southampton shirts quickly retreat, Salah though to Alexander-Arnold, and the return ball to Salah, was just a fraction short, using that sending off Katie Smith. Now, Burnley-Nill, Luton-Nill, but Luton relegation, threat Luton down to 10, Calnay-Smith of the back line, sent off second yellow, sliding in on Josh Brownhill, Burnley-Nill, Luton-Nill. Doncaster-Rowes have got a second goal, Doncaster-Rowes too, Swindon-Town-Nill. Doncaster-Hoo were third this morning in league two. Here is Walker-Peters, ball in field, Ugochukku, lets it roll, and then he was, referees played a good advantage there, actually a referee, Lewis Smith from Lancashire. Only the fifth game in the Premier League this season, as Smallbone on that left-hand side of the penalty area, Manning tried to thread it through, comes to Sulamana, no way through, Grombate was there, Liverpool concede another corner kick. They only had a bit of defending to do, haven't made the last five minutes, Southampton growing in confidence, Sulamana, once again, good feet to try and get a shot off inside the box, and Southampton pushing, Liverpool back. Just for confirmation as well, that substitution for Bellacockchap, coming on for Bednarak is a concussion substitute, so Southampton will still be able to use five more substitutes if they so wish. But now will be Neil Bolton won as the latest scorer in the league, one year up today. Southampton have another corner, again it's on the left-hand side, again Smallbone to take it, goes deep this time, looks for Harwood Bellacke, clicked away by Liverpool, kept in play by Saboslai on this near side. Saboslai looks for a long diagonal ball, Fernandez was running back, and required Bellacockchap to go to ground, and prevent it from reaching the red shirt of Nunez, and then the referee, Lewis Smith, who last weekend, would you believe, was taking charge of Chelmsfield against Werving in National League South, and here he is, officiating yet again at Anfield, where remains Neil Neil. We'll go to the Amix, John Southall. There's Broughton Neil, Fullham Neil, very little between these two sides, opening for Brighton and Minntay on the right-hand side, pass Basset, Leono saved it as near post, Brighton, Neil, Fullham Neil. Did I interrupt you? Were you going to say something before I went to John? I don't know, so you don't rate Chelmsfield and Werving then? No, I was just talking more about the contrast from Chelmsfield to Liverpool. I do. He has shown 134 yellow cards in his 40 games this season, as the Lancashire official. Here is Gravenberg forward, Chris Sutton is with us, Neil Neil. As it's almost 25 past three on this Saturday afternoon on Merseyside, for it is a very pleasant day. It almost feels as if spring has arrived. We've got a little bit of blue sky, the sun is shining. It's a little milder. Neil Neil. And Luke Warb so far from the league leaders. Here is Gravenberg, opens up for him, checks back onto his left foot, still going Gravenberg, overruns it, Alexander Arnold is there, saved by Ramsdale. Closed him down, quickly went to ground and made the block save. Now the counter-attack for Southampton, small bone, releases Sulamana, away on the left-hand side, in field. Grombeke is going to shoot, no he isn't, edge of the area. Now he might shoot, he held onto it too long. Liverpool had too many red shirts and took it off him. I've got to say, brilliant goalkeeping from Ramsdale, end to end now though. Here is Salah running forward, midway through the Southampton half, out to Alexander Arnold, high at the pitch on that far side, the right. So Bosslite with his dark hair trotting into the Liverpool attack, and then he passes the ball to Canars, in every outfield player now is in the half away towards our left. As Liverpool attack the Anfield road end. It is still Neil Neil. Here is Simacas, one of those three changes that Arnault Slott made. Lewis Diaz has got to get past Walker Peters, Dibbling's doubled up on him too, and then Diaz passes the ball in field, Gravenberg looked for a shooting opportunity. And in the end he's snuffed out, but the ball will rebound to Simacas, in field now to Van Dijk, Van Dijk who made 80 appearances and scored seven goals in his two and a half years on the South Coast. Alexander Arnold out towards Salah, Salah running at Manning, enters the penalty area on that far side. So Bosslite has a go and it noongies with a header over the top, loops over, and it will go out for a goal kick as Swansea City lead Middlesbrough by a goal to Neil in the championship, and there's been a try in Ireland, James Burridge. The perfect start to the second half for Ireland. Dan Sheehan off the back of the driving mall from a five meter line out, dived to the right hand side, Prendergast knocks over the conversion from touch, Ireland lead by 13 points to eight. commentary continues on sports, extra no other goals to tell you about Chris. No, it's better from Salah pushing Manning back, and probing, Manning's got to engage I think. Maya up and further out, and let Mo Salah drive into the box and the ball eventually, just a little bit too high for Nunes who couldn't direct his header on target. We've got Chukwuk back in the St Side, he was one of the six changes, of course he was ineligible to face his parent club last time out against Chelsea, but unable to really make any headway on this near side the right, and it'll be a Liverpool throw with 28 minutes played. Let's get an update from Salah's Park, Chris Coles. Crystal Palace, Neil Ipswich, Neil, but the chances continue to flow for Palace and Ketya, and Ezzah linking up well, Ezzah's shot well blocked, and Enciso at the other end for Ipswich, a right foot shot, well saved by the diving Dean Henderson. Alice, Neil Ipswich, Neil. Alison clears long, he got a lovely ovation as he came out to to warm up, and the Liverpool crowd got a first sight of him inside the stadium today, after his performance against Paris Saint-Germain. As Liverpool get a free kick over on that far side the right, Monday night club from seven, Tuesday will have commentary of Liverpool Paris Saint-Germain the return, we're at Villa Park on Wednesday, Preston Miller against Bruges, and it'll trap it on Thursday, Manchester United against Real, so she'd had three more successive nights of European football. Yes, Southampton unhappy about the award of the free kick, but it's a long ball from Alison, Manning and Salah competing for it, and Manning went down, there was a hand in the back from Salah, not a strong hand, and Manning threw himself to the floor, gathered the ball up, and I think the referee and the assistant on the far side, thought the correct decision gave the free kick to Liverpool, simulation. That's Chris Sutton, this is BBC Radio 5 Live, 0-0, Canate out to Alexander-Arnold, plays it in towards Gravenbork, finds the space, Nunes gets the shot away early, and it was a comfortable save by Ransdale, one touch, hit it low, left footed, Rumsdale low, low down, comfortable save, 0-0. Yes, the quickness of pass from Gravenbork, well 30 yards out, just feeds Nunes, just hit, he can't, he takes a quick first touch with his right foot, swivels, and tries to drive the ball with his weaker left foot, doesn't catch it cleanly, and Ramsdale makes a very comfortable save. 15 minutes to go to the break, there will be at least five minutes of added on time for that head injury to Bednarek, as Van Dyke gets it back from Gravenbork, and then just strokes it to Simicass, forward ball from Simicass, back with a Liverpool left back, ex-City leading Shrewsbury Town by a goal to Nill in League One, Van Dyke now will spread the ball out to Alexander-Arnold, off the chest, hits it early, hits it low, cut out by Manning, Sulimana back there on defensive duties now, gets away from Alexander-Arnold, who's struggling to keep up with Sulimana, his ball in field, Fernandez then just touches it, and it breaks down quite easily. Lewis Diasto wasn't alert, walk of Peter's wasps, steps out of defence and continues the run, Simicass brings him down, and that will be a Southampton free kick, and a yellow card is shown to the Liverpool left back Costa Simicass. Yeah, just not quite on the same wavelength at times the Liverpool players in this first half, and Walker-Peter's ends up with a ball and gets the other side of Simicass, and it's a rash challenge, it's a yellow card challenge every day of the week, Southampton breaking on Liverpool, you could say a good foul from Liverpool's perspective, 30-odd yards out, a little bit too far out to shoot in my book, not going to beat the goalkeeper of Allyson's quality, are they from there Ian? You wouldn't have thought so, it is fractionally right of centre, but Chris has called it in terms of the distance, 30-35 yards out, small bonus. The goalkeeper, the form he's in. Could be the quality of the strike from small bone, in the end he chips it, down with header by Harwood Ballas, Nunez was the one, don't think he heard the shout from Allyson because there was nobody running behind him, he's conceded a corner. And do you know what he did the right thing? It was a nervy clearance and maybe Allyson was there, didn't call early enough, but had a few corners Southampton, I think this is maybe their fourth, is it? I think you're probably right, fourth or fifth, small bone and all from that far side to the left, we're going to turf more in a moment, where there's been a goal, remember Lutentown were reduced to 10 men, they're at third place Burnley, small bone, with this corner kick for Southampton, nil-nil, 13 minutes to go to half time in the Premier League, small bone to take it, in it comes now, Van Dijk heads it out, Fernandez tries to guide the header back out towards small bone and then it's followed away by Alexander-Arnold and Grunbeck has to get there before Salah and he can't, Salah has gone past him, Salah now with a cross from the right hand side and Fernandez is there and he should get the ball away for Southampton, so to turf more, Katie Smith. Burnley won 10 man, Lutent, nil and it feels a bit cruel, an oom golfer sent back McGinnis, brought on to replace Cal Naysmith, he was sent off for a second yellow across him from the right hand side and he stabbed it home by accident, Burnley won Lutent, nil. Salah Malera has carried the ball forward to Uga Cikhu, Southampton are just starting to grow incompetence. Yeah they are but gotta say, what a recovery run from Fernandez there when Salah got away to the byline and pulled the ball back, right place, right time, to clear up the danger. Uga Cikhu, short diagonal ball, divelling, Walker-Peters on this near side, the right has to get away from Simacas and Diaz, helped out by dibbling, right corner of the area, runs in field, looks for the left footed shot, block, comes back to dibbling, just tried to prod it into the path of Fernandez, it's dug out by Gravenberg and Liverpool have the ball and then there's a foul there, small boat on Lewis Diaz, pre-kick to Liverpool, we'll go to find out what's happening in that title decider, Ireland-France, James Burridge. And France have taken back the lead, albeit controversially, Bordenhofer has borrowed over from five meters but the crowd in sense because they felt that Pietro Amani was taken out in the process, Ramos converted but Ireland have also lost Calvin Nash for at least 10 minutes as it's been referred to the bunker for a head-ahead or collision with Thomas Ramos, France have the lead back, 15 points to 13. commentary continues on Sports Extra, Diaz looks for the run of Jones ahead of him left-hand side of the penalty area, Jones plays it to Simacas, level the box, Jones now makes the run behind him so he's 25 yards out from goal in field to Gravenberg, back with Van Dyke, Van Dyke to Simacas, Simacas in field to Diaz but they're playing in front of those luminous yellow shirts of Southampton, Canate didn't control the ball, it runs past him and through to Alexander-Arnold, coming back into a central area midway through the Saints half, then Van Dyke along the ground, Simacas sends over the cross, Nunes climbs, small bone, clears it right footed, Tramir Rovers nil, Bromley 1 is a ladies' score in League 2, Tramir Rovers struggling in the nether regions of League 2, the two results earlier incidentally, Wimbledon 2 knocks County Nil, so Wimbledon go fourth and Walsall the leaders lost again, they've only had two wins in their last 11, Grimsby Town doing their playoff hopes, the world of good, winning 3-1 at the Besscott Stadium and they were the two results in League 2 and the two results in League 1, Crawley 1, Reading 1, Stockport County Nil, Charlton Athletic Nil, they've only lost one of their last 11 have Charlton under Nathan Jones, they're on a really really good run of form, there's been a goal at Brighton, Johnson out all. Brighton nil full and one, Raoul Hemdener has got the other side of Van Hecker who should have done better the centre half and finished it off, Brighton nil full and one. We've got under 10 minutes to go to half time, it remains nil nil, it's also goalless at South Hurst Park between Crystal Palace and Ipswich, later on we've got commentary of Aston Villa at Brentford for that 5-30 game in West London, as Dibbling picks it up now for Southampton and then in field to Fernandez, little touch then the cross and the stretch there was Albert Grombach, the Danish international just lacked the height to get on the end of that with a connection goal kick. You just peeled away didn't you on the diagonal from Canate, actually the longer this game has gone on Southampton, we're fancying this now Fernandez who's playing as a false nine so is Grombach but being more prominent Fernandez. Haven't won in the last eight visits to Anfield since a shame long goal in the League Cup semi-final back in 2017, they've failed to score in seven of those eight visits, it's nil nil here, we've got nine minutes to go to the break but the St supporters are in good voice in that Anfield road end away towards our left, Subosla in field to Alexander Ronald, 30 yards out from goal, his ball will go over the top of Bellacotcha, it'll be kept in play by Simacast with his quick cross, Bellacotcha heads it away then to Dias, turns outside the area, he waits, faces goal, Liverpool remember playing from right to left, Simacast on this near side, infield now to Gravenberg they go over League leaders, Southampton have everybody back behind the ball, they're being patient, Simacast goes down the line, Dias runs onto it, left hand side of the box, back with Simacast once more, just passes the ball, 10 yards infield to Gravenberg, Alexander Ronald now is in possession, Salah creates the width on that far side the right and he runs at Manning who backpedals, they've doubled up on him, Alexander Ronald joins Dias, he's back into the area, his shot left footed, blocked, will go to Pat Murphy at the Hawthorns in the championship. Still 0-0 here, QPR getting into this game, Dunn has just hit the side net and Johnson over the bar for West Brom after great work by Fellows, West Brom nilled QPR-0. Alexander Ronald's low cross, that'll be cleared by Manning, MK Donz who sacked Scotland, he is their manager last weekend, Ben Gladwin is the interim but MK Donz has fallen behind, MK Donz nil, Morkham 1, that's in league two, there are no other goals to tell you about as we have seven minutes to go to the break on this Saturday afternoon. Yeah and every Sassampton player you mention behind the ball, defending the box when Manning walled it, walled it at Sassampton left back, there's nobody up the pitch but he hooked it forward anyway, there's Liverpool straight back on the attack, there goes Dibbling. Referee has played the advantage as Dibbling will run forward but Gravenberg just running back and just easily takes it away off his toes and Liverpool see it back to Alisson, another try in Dublin, James Burridge. An outstanding counter-attack try from France, a second for Louis Bielbari after Penno, counter-attack from within his own half, Bielbari raised down the left wing for 30 metres, kicked the ball back inside somehow, managed to win the race to grind the ball down, Ramos has converted Ireland down to 14 still with Nash in the bin and it's France leading by 22 points to 13. Commentary continues on Sports Extra, England, Italy tomorrow incidentally there were commentary from three on the BBC Sport website. Salah enters the penalty area, Salah tried to thread it back towards the boss line, small bone there with the interception, Fernandez holds on to it, passes the ball back to Walker Peters inside his own box, Fernandez once again. Got a look of Catino, hasn't he? Mateus Fernandez. He has actually, I mentioned him a couple of moments ago, he's been good on the ball, he's been very composed. Fernandez signed him from Sporting in the summer, the Portuguese midfielder, that diminutive in statue like Philip Catino. Tramlia Rovers have equalised at Prenton Park, Tramlia 1, Bromley 1 is a latest score in League 2. It's 0-0 here, this is the Premier League, Fulham are leading at Brighton and Crystal Palace 0, earlier Forest beat Manchester City by a goal to 0, they moved within three points of second place Arsenal, Hugo Chukwu forward for Southampton, passes the ball out towards Dibbling on the right hand side, penalty at the Hawthorns, Pat Murphy. To West Brom, Adam Armstrong is about to take it right footed, disputed, Cook, the captain of the Queensborough Rangers has been booked for descent, looked in the innocuous challenge to me, West Brom won't care, it's 0-0, what a time to get a goal just for half time, here comes Armstrong and this nephatic goal, right foot finish to the right of the keeper, West Brom 1, Rangers 0. Thank you Pat and straight to Derby, there's been another goal, Lee Blatman. Blackburn have got one back, Derby 2, Blackburn 1, ball in from the right, picked out Mac Targay on the penalty spot and he blasted it into the roof of the net, five to go until half time, Derby 2, Blackburn 1. Adam Armstrong then with that goal for West Brom a Chalbion, on loan from Southampton, he just shy of 150 appearances for the Saints. Yeah I think that's a smart piece of business actually, that West Brom, Adam Armstrong scores goals at that level. Yes, proven. Newport County are leading at Chesterfield, Chesterfield 0, Newport County 1 is the latest scoring league too, the ball is at the feet of Allison as there's been a goal at Burnley in the championship, Katie Smith. And Burnley have doubled their lead over 10 man, Luton, Burnley 2, Luton 0, Lyle Foster this time the ball ricocheting around on the right hand side of the box, it comes in towards the back post and there's Lyle Foster to stab it home, Burnley 2, Luton 0. Liverpool really haven't progressed very far as Van Dijk now gives it to Gravenberg, they are on the halfway line as Van Dijk just jogs his way to join the attack and now it's with Gravenberg once again, Plymouth Argyll 0, Sheffield Wednesday 2 and it was Breitner Hobalby 0, Fullham 1 but you've seen another goal, John. Yeah, Breitner equalised, Breitner 1, Fullham 1, Freak it on the left hand side, met by Jean-Paul Van Hecke with the header off the left post and it went his first with the club, Breitner 1, Fullham 1. Simicast as a shot was blocked by Dias, Simicast and Gravenberg contrived to give the ball away, Liverpool win it back though, here is Jones just outside the penalty area, little ball in for Alexander-Arnold, there comes the cross and diving and sliding with Manning and it goes behind for Liverpool corner as we have three minutes to go to the break. Yeah, it's just that final ball for Liverpool, I've got to say Summer Southamptons last ditch defending has been first glass, firstly Ian Belikotch, I think got the block from Dias' effort and then Manning in that near post space position, you expect better quality from Alexander-Arnold but he's in the right place, right time to pop it behind Liverpool corner. So under three minutes to go, corner kick, we'll be going to Sunderland in a moment but let's just see what happens with this corner, it's Chesterfield have equalised at home to Newport now 1-1 and it comes from Simicast, two Southampton players go for the same ball, Howard Bell is downward header from Jones and then hooked over the crossbar and hooked high by Nunez, MK Don's 1, Morkham 1 is a latest score in League 2, now at the top of the championship Sheffield United Niel, Preston Niel, Burnley leading the 10 men of Luton Town by two goals to Niel, Sunderland against Cardiff City, Sunderland were ahead, John Bennett. Equaliser for Cardiff City, Sunderland won, Cardiff City won, Isaac Davis with the goal across, wasn't dealt with by the goalkeeper, fell to him back post, low finish, Sunderland won, Cardiff City won. That's fourth top against fourth bottom, Plymouth are Gail are next to bottom and not going too good for them this afternoon, John Acres. Sheffield Wednesday have done really well in this first half, it's Callum Patterson with the goal to make it 2-0 to potentially keep their season alive, Plymouth Niel, Sheffield Wednesday 2. Sports report at five will have all the results and all the reaction before Brentford against Aston Villa at 5.30, Connor McNamara and Matt Upson and then Chris Sutton and Robbie Savage will take your calls at around 7.30 on 6.06, 08, 08, 05, 9.09, 6.93, we've got 90 seconds to go of normal time, still expecting quite a bit of added on time here at Anfield, but it remains 0-0 and as predicted we will be having five minutes as the ball goes over the head of Suboslai, Salah tries to win it back, they do succeed in getting the ball back, in fact Nunez is a judge to have handled that ball by the referee Louis Smith. James Burridge watching Ireland France. France are bossing this second half, two tries and now Thomas Ramos has just knocked over another penalty, 25 points to 13, France lead. Commentary on Sports Extra as Ramstell takes his time, there is quite a lull in the atmosphere now here at Anfield as Ramstell hits that so long. He's meant to do that. But no, that was a good 30 yards ahead of every Southampton player, one bounce and it was out for a goal kick. That was absolutely ridiculous and he's had a little look over to the bench, I think that's saying we'd take a point here, isn't it? Stevenage won Mansfield, they probably would take a point to be fair. Chesterfield two Newport County ones, so Chesterfield have quickly turned that around with two goals in the space of three minutes. Will be very soon going into that official five minutes, a minimum of five minutes here at Anfield as Alexander-Arnold goes towards Nunez. But Bellacotcha was tight behind him, Smallbone helped out, they released the ball to Sulamana and Alexander-Arnold runs it out of play for a Southampton throw, so into stoppage time we go, goalers. Yeah, Sulamana has actually been a good ball carry of the Southampton, got them up the pitch, driving there, wins his team, a throw in Smallbone, winning the ball back initially, he's given that backline of Southampton good protection and it's turning out to be an awkward afternoon for Liverpool, you've got to earn titles, maybe people looking forward to Tuesday. Nobody's picked up the run for Smallbone and Van Dyke leaves it for Allison, Allison comes, doesn't get there, Smallbone slots the ball in, confusion at the heart of the Liverpool defence with Van Dyke and Allison and Smallbone took full advantage, he slotted the ball into the cop end, what a surprising scoreline here, the league leaders Liverpool, Niel, bottom of the table, Southampton won. I don't think anybody saw that coming, I mentioned it had been a nervy afternoon for Liverpool, so far, Allison having a word with the referee, I think he thought there was some sort of foul in there but it's just a simple throw in left hand side, Smallbone drives into the box, Van Dyke lets it run through to Allison, Allison doesn't use his hands, he just prods the ball out with his right boot and then Smallbone from the angle, left hand side of the box looks to square it back but instead reverses it back into the goal, it's a brilliant finish, it's a clever finish, Allison suggesting there was contact, I think it was Fernandez on him but not enough in that, I don't think and he actually not makes Allison Smallbone, it's a clever finish, brilliant finish and Southampton stun, Liverpool. Who for you was at fault, Allison or Van Dyke? I think Allison should come with his hands, just pick it up, he didn't, he went with his foot and it's the softest of goals and now Liverpool, I think Liverpool fans rocking up today would have thought this is going to be a formality, they're going to have to work at it now. Lake Norrion, Nill, Northampton Town 2 and there you have the perfect illustration of how life can change very very quickly for a goalkeeper, when you make the saves this hour he's expected to make those saves, oh that was a crude challenge by Nunez, he has just kicked out and side down Walker Peters, that was extremely crude. Well what's he doing? I think he'll see yellow but as one there's no attempt to win the ball and he's just a careless kick out Walker Peters who had got beyond him the other side, yellow card out, referee's hand, I think that's right but what's he playing at? Got a control himself in Liverpool, losing control, before half time here. So days after the performance of his life against Paris Saint-Germain, Alisson and van Dijk break down in communication and the fact that they actually haven't had a look at this would suggest that VAR would be maybe looking at a potential red because the free kick hasn't been able to be taken, again you wouldn't have a clue inside the stadium that VAR are doing that but I'm only surmising. But are they looking for serious foul play? Maybe so I think. The VAR incidentally is Matt Donahue in the VAR. I don't know how far away from the ball Nunez was but it was such a reckless, staff challenge. In your opinion was it serious foul play or violent conduct? Because they're the two elements that would ultimately warrant a straight red. Yeah they are now looking at, we've got confirmation of the VAR. Let's get an update from Pat Murphy at the Hawthorns. No, Daniel Furlong, I'm told, has been sent off to West Bromwich Arbyn, West Brom 1, Queen's Park Rangers 0. If that we can go to Pat now. As I was saying, Daniel Furlong sent off straight red card, elbowed, Koki Saeed to the winger, no doubt told the referee's mind, West Brom curious, they'll now play, Cutlery Mears and the next second half with 10 men but the leading 1-0. Thanks Pat, so after that VAR check it's just the yellow card. Yeah and I just wonder whether there was, you know, looking at the replay, whether they'd say well Nunez did make an attempt to win the ball but it's just stupidity from him. I don't think he did, I think he's gotten away with one there but Liverpool lucky to have 11 on the pitch. And so Hampson with Sulamana, it's a bit of a live wire, passes the ball out towards Dibbling, Simacast there with the interception, gets there first, Simacast over the halfway line, Salah stays out wide, Simacast can't release the ball, he's all on his left foot, couldn't get the angle to switch it with his right towards that right hand side towards Salah. Alexander Arle now runs forward, the league leaders are behind, Salah who's been quiet, comes in field, continues to come in field, blocked by Small Boat, falls to Van Dyke, we're in stoppage time, where Liverpool are behind, here is Dias, Dias now goes on the outside of Walker-Peters, just about keeps the ball in play, left hand side of the penalty area, Simacast with the cross, Salah lets it run through, Alexander Arle, doesn't hit first time, now the good block comes in from Manning, just through his body in front of it, Subostlai keeps the ball in play on that far side, Canate, that goal has certainly sparked Liverpool into life but they give the ball away through Fernandez, let's go to Dublin, latest from James Burridge. And France are blowing Ireland away, they've scored their bonus point try, replacement forward, Oscar Gershw, docks the ball down, Ramos kicks it through, that's three second half tries from France and the score line, 32 points to 13. Wow commentary on sports extra, Subostlai, here is Salah, excellent challenge made by Manning, it looked like it was going past him and then a last ditch challenge by Manning, just carved it away from the path of Salah, there is the halftime whistle and nobody expected this score line, started the commentary by talking about a potential home banker, anything but Liverpool, Nilsalhampton won. Yeah, just hasn't happened for Liverpool and Salahampton have shot them with a small bone, goal, an error I think from Alisson, maybe Van Dyke as well could have done better to try and ask for a ball back to Alisson, but Alisson wasn't decisive, and all of a sudden says Anton find themselves in front, they've defended deep, they've defended brilliantly at time, last ditch blocks but Liverpool have got serious work to do in this second half. Yes they do, because not many expected this score line, it's Liverpool Nilsalhampton won. Worth the petrol money? I knew you were going to play there. So I was praying that the small bone goal would be real bad. Can I just say if you're claiming expenses, I'm giving you a lift back to Salphord, it's my petrol. Thank you very much to you both, second half on the way to Liverpool Nilsalhampton won, remember in the early game, Nottingham Forest won Manchester City 0, only three games at three o'clock in the Premier League next to the Amex all-square at the break, John Seathal. Yes Brighton won, full-on-one, we had 35 minutes of mediocrity, then the full-on goal, lovely cross from a rope, Wobby on the right hand side, Jan Paul van Hecke, missed judge, Dier Raal Himmenes didn't, and he smashed it in at the back post, tenth league goal of the season, equalised a seven minutes later, free kick, met by van Hecke, who headed in off the left post, his first goal of the further club, good finish as well, Brighton won, full-on-one. All-square at Salherst Park as well, Chris Coles. But no goals in this one, Palace 0, Ipswich 0, it's had its moments, particularly in the opening 10 minutes, both sides creating their best chances early, Wharton's through, Baldwin Kettier, denied by a smothering Palmer save, Philogen for Ipswich on the end of a cutback, Henderson diving low to save, the chances that followed not of the same quality, Lermer from range, and Ancizo shooting at the keeper from an angle, a bit more care needed from both in the final third, Crystal Palace 0, Ipswich 0. Into the championship earlier, Coventry 3, Stoke 2, and Watford 1, Millwall 2, as far as the three o'clock's are concerned, we'll start at Bramble Lane, Julia Boldt. It is Sheffield's United 0, Preston 0, Chris Wilder went down the tunnel at half-time, shaking his head because he knows his side have had more possession, and some good chances to go in front, but we yet to see a goal here, Tyrese Campbell and Gustavo Harmer both being clear on goal, but have shot wide. Preston have been defending with all they have, and they did have a penalty shot, Bradpott's looks have been brought down by Vinnie Souza in the box, the ref waved it away, half-time Sheffield United 0, Preston 0. Three red cards in the championship already this afternoon, one of them's come at Turfmore, Katie Smith. Burnley 2, Tenman, Luton 0, and with that score at Sheffield United, Burnley up to second in the live table right now on goal difference, game burst into life after 90 minutes, Cal Naismith of Luton sent off for a second yellow, then Mark McGinnis brought onto proper Luton's back line, only five minutes later his botched clearance giving Burnley the lead, Lyle Foster adding another side-footing and a ball from the right, Luton sitting deep, this second half could be pretty horrible to come from there, five points from safety, and they're trailing 2-0. Sunderland one card if one at the break, details from John Bennett. Yeah, frustration for Sunderland following a dream start, in form Elisa Mayenda with an emphatic finish on two minutes, Patrick Roberts played him in after winning the ball back, Sunderland were in control at that stage, Romain Mundall the winger, a constant danger but they didn't get the second and Cardiff equalised, Odouda's cross not dealt with by the goalkeeper who thought he was fouled the ball fell to Isaac Davis who scored on his first start of the season, Mayenda then hit the side netting but at halftime it's Sunderland one, Cardiff City one. West Brom another side down to 10 at the break but they do lead Pat Murphy. Two controversial decisions by the referee, Adam Herk said just for halftime he ruled that Morgan had tripped Malumbi, pounded it at Armstrong, converted and then Furlong, West Brom's full back sent off straight red card allegedly elbowing Saeto in the face, we'll see how West Brom hang on to that lead, the lead QPR 1-0. And the third red card of the championship afternoon has gone to Hull but they lead as well at Bristol City, Ohain Gwyneth. Yeah Bristol City 0, Hull City 1 after dominating the early stages Hull took a deserved lead with a well taken goal by Giao Pedro but a minute later the Brazilian-born Italy cap striker unnecessarily lunged into a tackle with George Tanner just inside the Bristol City half and was shown a straight red. Bristol City have pressured Hull's defence with plenty of crosses, centre forward Sinclair Armstrong missing the best one headed over from close range, Bristol City 0, Hull City 1. Going well for John Eustice against his former club, Lee Blightman. Great game, this has been marked, Derby 2, Blackburn 1, Derby 2 up inside the first seven minutes, Forsythe with the first, Adams with the second, Blackburn got one back through, McTarget, great finish, five before half time, it's been wide open for the most part and as things stand, Derby are off the bottom of the table, Derby 2, Blackburn 1. Replaced by Plymouth, John Acres. And as things stand, Plymouth fans around me feel like that's it, feel like that if they don't have a miraculous comeback in the second half that could be their season. Plymouth-0, Sheffield Wednesday 2, Ogbetter couldn't deal with a cross from the left hand side and put it through his own goal and then Patterson with a really cool finish, they've been undone down the left hand side twice Plymouth, it's Plymouth-0, Sheffield Wednesday 2. Just one championship game that we're not at this afternoon and that's at Swansea in the home side, Lee Middlesbrough by a goal to nearly on G-Song. With that, in the early games in League 1, both finished all square, Crawley and Reading 1 all, Stockport 0, Charlton 0. Goalless is also the scoreline involving the leaders this afternoon, Birmingham, they're at home to Lincoln, Adam Cotier. They are having to play the patient game, Birmingham City here, lots of possession, they've had the best openings to, Emil Hansen curled wide just before half time, that's probably the closest they've come, Taylor Gardner, Hickman also had a left foot volley saved by Wittings in the Lincoln goal, Lincoln playing well, Birmingham 0, Lincoln 0. Good news for Birmingham is that the size behind them aren't taking advantage as yet, second place Wittings behind Adam Witty. Yeah, they've been poor, they trail Peterborough by one goal to nil, Posh have been in total control, Malik Mothersill's penalty the difference, but Bradley, Eovian and Mothersill came close to adding a second, Posh going eight points clear of the drop zone as it stands, Wickham's hold on an automatic promotion place which seemed certain six weeks ago might just be slipping, Peterborough 1, Wickham 0 at the break. Third place Wrexham being held though as well, Mark Webber. They are Wrexham 0, Rotherham 0, the keepers are each ended in their corner this half with a super save each to keep it goalless, audible groans from the Wrexham fans as they fluffed multiple chances, Sam Smith with two, they came close after some early Rotherham pressure, Rotherham Malik Wilt had a point blank shot of the Wrexham keeper who made himself big to block and then towards the end of the half, Rotherham keeper Dylan Phillips diving low to his left to stop a goal going in from Matty James to make it Wrexham 0, Rotherham 0. Elsewhere in league one it's goalless between Barnsley and Blackpool Bristol Rovers, lead Huddersfield by a goal to nil, Rool Satiriou with that five for the season for him, Burton Nill, Bolton 1, Exeter who have got just one win from their last 12 in the league, lead bottom of the table, Shrewsbury by a goal to nil, Leighton Orient could be on course for a fifth straight defeat in the league because they trail Northampton by two goals to nil at the break at home, Cameron McGee and getting the second of those goals for Kevin Nolan side and he's now got nine for the season, Stephen Isley Mansfield by a goal to nil, Jamie Reeds 10th of the season, the difference between the two sides there and it's goalless between Wigan and Cambridge in league two, AFC Wimbledon 2, Knotts County nil and Walsall 1 Grimsby 3 is how it finished earlier and because of Walsall's defeat Bradford could go top this afternoon if they win at Jillingham, Charlotte Richardson. It's Jillingham nil, Bradford nil, Bradford enjoyed dominant spells throughout the opening half, had their best chance when former Jills player Jules Lapsley pressed the ball, winning possession for Jamie Walker to feed Tommy Lee in behind, he was supported by Jills keeper Glenn Morris, quick off his line to close the angle, make himself big and block the shot, the visitors looking the more likely to score, it is a massive second half to come for them, if Bradford can break that deadlock take those three points home, as you say Mark, they will finish the day at top of league two at the break though it's Jillingham nil, Bradford nil. Elsewhere Barrow 1, Akrington nil, goalless between Cheltenham and Colchester, Chesterfield were a goal down at Holmton Newport but they turned it round very quickly to lead by two goals to one, Doncaster 2, Swindon nil, Rob Street getting the first of their goals, seven for the season for him, it's goalless between Fleetwood and Port Vale and between Harrogate and Carlisle, NK Donnes 1, Morkham 1, Sulford nil, Crew nil and Tramir 1, Bromley 1, Michael Cheeks 18th of the season putting Bromley ahead there, Josh Hawks of Tramir getting the equaliser, earlier in the National League leaders Barnett beat Dagnam and Redbridge by a goal to nil to go 12 clear of York at the top of the table having played two games more, in the three o'clock games AFC file nil, Braintree 1, Aldershot 1, Gateshead 1, Boston nil, Woking 1, Eastley 1, Hartlepool 1, Halifax 1, Joville nil, Maidenhead nil, Sutton 1, Rochdale lead, Wildstone 1 nil, Solihull Moors 1, Ebb's Fleet 1, South Ender 2 upon Ultrigam and it's Tamworth 1, Oldham 1 in the no Scottish Premiership Games this afternoon, Scottish quarterfinal weekend, earlier Aberdeen beat Queen's Park to join Hart in the semi-finals, in the championship this afternoon, Aedrionians nil, Hamilton nil, leaders Falkirk are a goal upon Dumfermling, Morton nil, Air 1 in League 1, Allewa nil, Arbroath 1, Anand nil, Stenhouse Mjoln, Covranges 2, Queen of the South 1, goalless between Dunbarton and Inverness and Kelty Hart and Montrose in League 2, Bonnymary Gros nil, Edinburgh City nil, the leaders East 5 for a goal upon Clyde, Elgin nil, Forfar nil, Elgin down to 10, also goalless between Spartans and Sterling and Stranra and Peter Head. Back to the Aviva Stadium where France have absolutely annihilated Ireland in the second half, James Burridge. And you know Mark, Harry talked about the bench and the importance, my goodness Fabian Gautay's got its spot on, it was risky, it was a gamble, but the heft, the ferocious power that he has unleashed in this second half, Ireland have had no answer to it at all as they try and throw some seven minutes until halftime, 35 points to 13, one of France's biggest ever results, potentially coming here in Dublin, three tries in this second half and actually Ireland started brilliantly, they came out and scored within two minutes, Houdan, Sheehan, France looked to sleep but my goodness, they then woke up big time, three tries, Biaburi has been brilliant and as Ireland desperately try and get a try, they're trying to get within a bonus point because points are going to make such a big difference as we go into the final weekend, they've got to try and get a bonus point to get the game within seven as they're coming back for a penalty, but it has been all power and they've had no answer to it. And James, if it comes down to actually points differential then France are way ahead as well aren't they? Well because they're completely thumped Italy two weeks ago as you'll remember in Rome and so Ireland are desperately trying to get something out of this game, they've got six and a half minutes to do it but the writing is on the wall and we talked all the week about statement victories, in fact you know France have now intercepted from five metres from their own line and they're going to try and race this one home, has Damien Panno got the legs on Prendergast, yes he has, that is the clinching score, it is shuttered Ireland's grand slam dream and this sixth nations title is there for the taking, France have produced an outstanding second half here in Dublin, one of their biggest victories under Fabien Gaultier and my goodness me nobody saw this result coming, France 40 with the conversion to come, Ireland 13. And that conversion right in front of the post so you would expect them to go 42-13 up, back to Anfield shortly where Liverpool trail southampton by Goulton they'll let the break after John Barnes in the news.

At the conversion lens, so it's 42.13, some of the second halves underway in the football Dmitri Mitchell with his sixth of the season as double dexter's leading league one at home to Shrewsbury and Wrexham have scored earlier at the start of the second half. I've won in their last four at home in the league but they lead rather than by a goal to know thanks to Sam Smith, three minutes into the second half. Once Ireland France is over, Scotland Wales takes over on Sports Extra. Jamie Lyle. Well I think the complexion of this game has changed markedly over the past few weeks as Scotland's hopes of challenging for the title wailed and withered for another year. Wales looks to be renewed and reinvigorated by new coach Matt Sherrod. Remember still in an unprecedented 15 game losing streak but imbued with such hope, such positivity having run the Champions Ireland so close in Cardiff. It's a fascinating psychological dynamic and it all kicks off in around 40 minutes time. 445. Thank you, Ireland have just gone over in school to try Healy with it and I think they've converted that virtually immediately as well so that now takes the score to 42 points to 20. You're about to get back underway at Anfield. Chris Sutton and Ian Dennis. Thank you Mark. Yes we're Southampton are leading by a goal to nil and Arna Slott who of course remember is suspended. He's in the stands for this second of his two match. Dutch line Bant has actually made a triple change at the start of this second half. So Robertson has come on for Simicast at left back. Harvey Elliott after that smash and grab raid the pick pocket from Paris. He has come on for Jones in the midfield and McAllister has replaced the boss line. Liverpool all in red playing from left to right as we look. They're unbeaten at Anfield in 18 games where they have scored at least two in each of those 18 fixtures as Nunez tries to win the ball back. Southampton haven't made any alterations at halftime but they did use that concussion substitute during the first half. I'll run through the two teams for you as Wrexham are leading rather in the United by a goal to nil and Exeter City two Shrews. Brinella's a latey score also. Liverpool win a corner kick. Allison Alexander-Ronal van Dyke, Canate Robertson, Elliott Gravenberg, McAllister, Diaz Salah and Nunez. Southampton, Ramsdale, Walker Peters, Bellacock, chap the substitute, Harwood Bellison Manning, Dibbling Smallbone the goal scorer, Uga Chukwu, Fernandez, Silamana and Grombe. Southampton defending the Cop in their luminous yellow shirts and Navy shorts are playing from right to left as we look. Swindon have got a goal back at Doncaster. Doncaster over's two, Swindon one. We'll get the thoughts of Chris Sutton at the start of the second half after this corner kick where Ramsdale jumps up and down on his goal line. It's an in-swinger, plenty of lock, plenty of height towards the far post. Salah leaves it for Elliott, drives it in! Ramsdale superb save. Yeah, what a save this is from Ramsdale. It's a corner deep to the back post. Mo Salah picks the ball up and feeds Elliott who right foot and hammers the shot and is heading into the far corner. Ramsdale down to his right hand side, tips around the far post, sensational goalkeeping. Excellent reflex save, two handed down to his right, in comes the corner kick again, it's from that far side. Headed back out towards McAllister, level the penalty area on the left. Ball is hit forward, diagonal ball, running, manning, tucked in the left back. Elliott goes over the top, commits himself, Dibbling now picks it up, the counterattack is on for Southampton. Suleymano now has the ball midway through the Liverpool half. Suleymano does a little step over, cuts inside, shoots, blocked by Elliott, Nunes with a flick on. Salah trying to get in between the two, two Southampton defenders, couldn't get the touch and there was better, Cotch up to see it back towards Ramsdale. Have you just sense the atmosphere inside the stadium? Ian has gone up a notch and Liverpool decides to have substitutions from Arnazot at half time, three-foot-long to bring extra energy, couldn't figure, and you feel that they're going to come out in this second half and play with the desired intensity to try and get back into this game. Setback for Doncaster Robes and their automatic promotion hopes in league two, they work two-nil up against Swindon, but Swindon with two goals in a minute, equalised, it's two-two. DS running forward, DS, edge of the D, leaves it for Salah, Salah, shot blocked by Howard Bellis, and then it's Alexander Arnault who touches the ball back inside the centre-circle all the way back to Allyson, three minutes into the second half. The noise inside Anfield there was so loud, actually couldn't hear the studio instruction as to where we were going to go next, but it will be to Salah's park and Chris Colts. Where Crystal Palace have just hit the post, still nil-nil with Ipswich, Everett, Eze shot from the edge of the area, took a massive deflection, sent it spiralling into the sky, beat the keeper, dropped against the frame of the goal, still Palace nil-nil, which nil. Robertson's just dropped across in from the left and Manning wasn't sure where Salah was, and he's followed it behind for a corner. Well, I tell you where Salah was, he was outstanding on the edge of the box, and he's got to attack that area, that back post, the brilliant ball in from Robertson, blind ball in, but into a good area, Manning taking no chances. Liverpool are now certainly playing with a greater tempo as they trail. McAllister with a corner kick right hand side, it's an out-swinger, Ramstell's got something on it down towards Alexander-Arnold, scoop goal was by Robertson, and scoop wide off the left boot, and it goes behind for a goal kick. Full-time now in Ireland in the Six Nations, James Burridge. A thumping victory for France, 42 points to 27, one of Fabien Galtier's best ever. Their power was unrelenting and Ireland had no answer. Four second half tries for Le Bleu, and Ireland's Grand Slam Dream is in tatters. We are set for a fascinating final weekend. France go top for now, two points clear of Ireland. England play Italy tomorrow, three o'clock commentary, that'll be live on the BBC Sport website. Scotland Wales gets underway at 4.45 at Murrowfield, commentary on sports extra, as Burton-Albion have equalised at home to Bolton-Wanderers in League One. Burton-Want, Bolton-Want is a ladies' score in the Premier League. Brighton and Hobalbion-Want, full-on-Want, Crystal Palace, Neal-Lips, which Town-Neal, earlier not even Forest Peak Manchester City by a goal to Neal, and Southampton leading here by a goal to Neal. Alexander-Arnold with the throw, reaches Nunez, cut out by Bellicottcha, only as far as Harvey Elliott tried to play Alexander-Arnold on the overlap on the right-hand side, bobbling ball, and Manning can clear it for Southampton. Going to be back to the wall for the Saints. It is, we saw one from Manning in the first half, nobody up the pitch for Southampton, everybody behind the ball, and Manning just punting the ball into touch there, and Liverpool is not a tech-fee defence, isn't it? And that's the way it's going to be in this second half. Bonsley-Neal, Blackpool-Want is the latest scoreline in League One, Robertson to Diaz, Diaz on his toes, running in off that left touch line, goes towards the byline. Diaz to the finish! To Red New Year's! With the goal from close range, right-footed, pitted early, pitted hard, pitted low, but it's Ramstill. The roar inside, unfeeled, will tell you the lead lead is 11-on-1-1. Different Liverpool in the second half, direct from Diaz on that left-hand side, driving it, Walker-Peters, shifts the ball, gets to the byline, pulls it across the city-line, and Darwin-Muniz on the move, gets the vital touch, Ramstill in a sensational save at the start of the second half, no chance with that one, Liverpool level. They might have the small matter of a League Cup final next weekend, they might have an enticing Champions League midweek tie against Paris Saint-Germain, but you speak to any Liverpool supporter, the one trophy they crave the most is the Premier League title, and their level at 11, from Elena Sina-Gold, Julia Bold. Is Sheppield United won Preston Nill, the ball came in from the left-hand side, and it was a diving header by Tyrese Campbell to eventually break the deadlock, Sheppield United won Preston Nill. Diaz with a shot saved by Ramstill, Liverpool at the moment, it's all Liverpool, this is loose Diaz, penalty, Liverpool a bit of a penalty, Darwin-Muniz was fouled inside the area, the referee tried to let the game flow, brought it back, Liverpool have an opportunity now to take the lead. Well Southampton players surrounding the referee, they're not happy with this award of a penalty, let's have a look, is there contact? I think it's a soft one in truth, Darwin-Muniz gets his body in on small bone, but the fact he's awarded the penalty, the referee, I don't think they'll overturn it, but it's as soft as can be, Munoz has played for that. Thing is, earlier in the season you heard the referee's call, it would take a lot to change the referee's call. Absolutely, but it's so minimal, for Nuno to hit the deck as he does do and stay down, I can understand Southampton's frustration, you know, really can, but what a turn around from Liverpool, start with their second half, they've gone through the levels, haven't they? Up a gear, two gears, three gears, and there's Salah placing the ball on the spot. The penalty stands, Liverpool have scored all seven Premier League penalties this season, it's Mo Salah, 30 goals already to his name for this campaign, he waits, Ramsdale is on the goal line, Liverpool won, Southampton won, there's the referee's whistle, Salah takes his time, runs to his right, runs up now, left-footed, and scores, Mo Salah, our right third in Liverpool's all-time list of goal scorers with goal 242, and it's the second goal of the afternoon that puts it in front by two goals to one. Did we expect anything else, it's a brilliant penalty. Goes to Ramsdale's right-hand side, Ramsdale gets this correctly, but he can't get near it, emphatic from Salah, and Liverpool, this second half, Blimey, they've been hungry, they've played with the intensity, and now they're in front. Only Roger Hunt with 285, and Ian Rush with 346 goals, have scored more than Mo Salah, Bristol City won, Hull City won, killing of a leading Bradford City by a goal to Nils, a Bradford City might miss out on an opportunity to go to the top of League two, and there's been another goal at turf four, Katie Smith. Burnley three, ten-man, Luton, Nils, top scorer Josh Brownhill getting the final touch, Sammy at home, the ball brought in on the right-hand side from Edwards, taking it from the by-lan, I've got to say from my vantage point, it looked like the ball had gone out, but the goal stands, Burnley three, Luton, Nils. And Liverpool also with that second goal from Mo Salah, have once again scored at least two now, in each of their 19 games here at Anfield, unbeaten in the previous 18 by doing so. late Norian have got a goal back, late Norian won, Northampton down two, but that change of attitude, application in the second half has reached its rewards, what, 11 minutes into the second period? Yeah, and you know, just greater intensity, they're running harder, they've put Southampton under pressure, they've suffocated themselves, Hampton haven't been able to get out, and it's a totally different Liverpool performance we've seen in their second half, didn't take them long, did it after half time, they now go in front, and they know what it means, you mentioned their desire to win another Premier League title this season, they want to win as many trophies as they can, but that's the one Liverpool fans want to win, and there've been Noisyri and in their second half, haven't they? Oh yes they have, they've played their part too, and they will be noisy on Tuesday night, not my words for the visit of Paris-Azhamat, but now in one, Bolton Wanderers two as the latest scorer in League One, Southampton, who were leading at half time, and now just having to hang in the game because Liverpool were looking to try and release Lewis Diaz, but it went and reached Ramsdale who bowls the ball out towards Manning, but Liverpool have certainly pecked things up in the second half, and now lead by two goals to one, back towards Ramsdale it goes, who floats it out towards that far side, on a slot making that triple change, McAllister heads it on, Southampton get a free kick, I wonder where we'll go next then, news of the Bristol City goal it is with the Oanguini. Bristol City One, Hull City One, Anis Mehmeti scores his 12th the season from the penalty spot, sending the keeper the wrong way to put it in the bottom left, Sinclair Armstrong winning the penalty, Bristol City One, Hull City One. Well Bradford City second in League Two against a Jullingham team who only have won one win in their last 15, however they are leading, Charlotte Richardson. Jullingham One, Bradford, Neil Connor, Masterson gives the host the lead from a corner, Masterson with his back towards goal able to turn and powerfully strikes the ball through a busy six yard area into the back of the net, Jullingham One, Bradford, Neil. Good news for Walsall supporters, their team have been faltering of late, only two wins in their last 11, losing today at home to Grimsby Town by three goals to one, it's all Liverpool now isn't it? Oh it is, I mean they're totally on top, but they are the noticeable difference Ian, is that they're really running harder, Southampton not getting a moment's peace, a chance to any of the Southampton players to get on the ball and get the heads up and make your pass, Liverpool are smothering them, dominating them. You've played in big European games and when you know you've got one on the horizon as Liverpool have against Paris Saint-Germain, as a player how hard is it not to look too far ahead? I sort of get it and I think it was a case, no disrespect to Southampton before this game where maybe they're going into it and Southampton's record they've been particularly poor this season, bottom of the Premier League by a distance where you're just expecting something to happen rather than players going out and making it happen and that's been the difference in what the first 12-13 minutes in this second half, greater desire, intensity and they've got the rewards. Passing the ball as well, a lot sharper quicker in this second period, Barnes and Neal Blackpool too. Team news now from Brentford for our 5-30 commentary, Connor McNamara. Thomas Frank makes one change from Brentford's draw against Everton, 10 games to go, Christian Norgaard has recovered from concussion, he comes back into the midfield in place of Yarmalook, Vila 1 in Bruges of the Champions League on Tuesday, two changes here, one of them in goal, Robin Olsen back for Ennie Martinez who's a back injury, Jacob Ramsey replaces Marcus Rashford is on the bench. Matt Upson will be alongside Connor for commentary of that game at Brentford after sports report will bring you the results and the reaction. DS running forward and running hard on that far side the left, again they double up on him but he looks to try and squeeze in between the two Southampton players, pulls it back, Robertson has a shot that was blocked, comes to the Van Dijk, Van Dijk will pass it to Alexander Arnold who shoots and shoots wide, right footed, off target, goal kick Liverpool now lead 2-1. Yeah that low back lift from Alexander Arnold, all sorts of movement on the ball but as well wide I think of Ramsdale's right hand post, goes for power, new is I tell you, middle of the goal, wasn't far off getting a touch there. Said before that we're entering the final straight for Liverpool before today, 10 games remaining, six of them at home and they're looking to use their home advantage to full effect as they lead by two goals to one, to the south coast, John Southall. Brighton 1, full on 1 really tightness, Brighton had a goal disaligned, Metoma tucked it in but Minte was offside when he crossed the ball, he played 64 minutes, here come Fulham cleared away by Brighton, Brighton 1 full on 1. Salah almost got Nunez in, stopped by Harwood Bellis, plays it short to Uga Chukwu, back with the England international Harwood Bellis who then hits the ball over the top, Ivan Ureich who 49 year old Croatian patrol in that tiny technical area down below as we sit in our lofty position here in the main stand on this bright afternoon on Merseyside, he's lost nine of his 10 games in the Premier League. Ivan the terrible you could say but it's not all on him this season is it? It's not, I mean you consider the poor start that they had, that was a terrible start, one point from 27, nine without a win, they were always behind the eight ball with a start such as that, here is Alexander Arnold and even regardless what they may have dreamt of today, still destined to go back to the championship Southampton when you've only won two out of 27 games all season. I mean the fact they've lost 22 I mean is an incredibly poor record isn't it but I tell you it's afternoon first half, they more than competed didn't they? Yes they did. Arnold in there, blocks in and around the box frustrated Liverpool but they have been blown away in this second half and they have barely been in the Liverpool half. Only Sheffield United in top division history have had fewer points at this stage of a season when they had eight in the 75-76 campaign. MK Donns have come from behind, they now lead more combined, two goals to one in league two for Ben Gladwin as their interim after the departure of Scott Lindsay. McAllister strokes it towards Diaz, Liverpool after that tempo now you can, the way that they're playing there's that element of control, they've reasserted themselves in this game as they've come from behind, here is Diaz who passes the ball behind the referee Lewis Smith in his ultra blue referee's jersey, Manning cuts it out from reaching Salah, Manning then lifts it away from Elliott, it'll touch with his head, Salah, Fahjie's running over, it'll be a free kick to Salahampton, he wants to take it quickly but there's nobody there. We'll go now to South London Chris Coles. Crystal, Palace, Niel, Ipswich, Niel, the chances continue to flow, the goals do not, Henderson unconvincing from a corner, luckily Sar just behind him cleared off the line and Eze at the other end for Palace, a shot well saved by the backpedaling Palmer, still somehow Palace, Niel, Ipswich, Niel. Sugawari is going to come on for Dibbling and Archer is also going to be coming on Cameron Archer and he will replace Albert Grombeke the Danish international, double change being made for Salahampton in an attempt to try and get back onto level terms as Liverpool lead by two goals to one, Chris. Cameron Archer will go as a central striker, play up top in Southampton, maybe more of a focal point, a target type and someone who'll play higher up and occupy the two Liverpool centre halves, they didn't set up in the first half in that same sort of system and style, they played two up top but they were withdrawn to Grombeke and Fernandez, it's a little tweak there. 64 minutes play, Archer had made the run, that was cut out by the Liverpool defence, now it's with McAllister, Nunes, here is Dias, Van Dijk just over the halfway line, left of the centre circle playing from left to right, attacking the cop end, no other goals to tell you about elsewhere around the country, BBC Radio Five Live, BBC Sounds and the World Service, later Brentford against Aston Villa, 606 to come as well with Chris and Robbie, Dias stopped in his track, Smallbone who gave Southampton the lead, then hit the ball up towards Archer, Van Dijk glides back and then on the run heads it towards Gravenburg and Liverpool are once again on the front foot with McAllister going forward, low to the feet of Dias able to turn, Dias enters the area, crosses the ball, Elliott on the rise and his header dropped over the top for a goal kick. Dias has been much more lively, as most of the Liverpool players in the second half and Elliott's brought a little spark hasn't he? Maybe expected that after his goal in Paris, good run into the box, just can't direct the head up on target and just looking at Southampton set up, Chukavarra has gone into that right back position and Kyle Walker-Peters just playing up one. As Ramsdale bides his time in his all-purple goalkeeping outfit and hits it right footed downfield. But Canate comes a long way out of defence to head that on this near side, the right, Salford City have just taken the lead at home to crew by a goal to nil in league two as Alexander-Arnold ties up in the midfield to Van Dijk, Gravenburg caught in possession by Fernandez and Sulamana can come forward, Southampton still remain in the game as McAllister though stops the run of Sulamana on the edge of the area, they try and hoisted away downfield towards Diaz, a goal at Plymouth, John Acres. Sheffield Wednesday season is still alive, it's Plymouth-Nil, Sheffield Wednesday three, super finish from Gassamer, Plymouth-Nil, Sheffield Wednesday three. Another Sheffield Wednesday fans don't like to hear it but Danny Roll is somebody who has been linked in the past with Southampton and is being talked about once again as a potential Southampton manager as they are leading three-nil at home park Birmingham City and Lincoln, a penalty at St Andrews in league one, Adam Cotier. For Birmingham City and to be taken by Kieran Dowle, a water foul by Sam Cluchas, the Lincoln sub, so Dowle about to step up here, he'll take this left footed, the referee blows his whistle, it's Dowle and he scores, puts it in the top corner, Birmingham one, Lincoln-Nil. A reminder that second place Wickham are behind at Peterbury, united by a goal to Nill and with Wrexham leading, Rotherham United, Wrexham would go into that automatic promotion spot without a win in four home games as Blackpool have rattled a third at Oakwell, Barnes and Nill, Blackpool three in league one. We're approaching the midway point of the second half and Liverpool leading by two goals to one, it's almost as if the normal order has now been restored, even within the crowd, the atmosphere, the feeling around the place. Absolutely, I think everybody inside the stadium understood what was needed in the second half, the crowd responded, the players responded to the crowd and Colin Nunes is now getting a huge ovation, he responded with that goal and then winning the penalty and I suppose there's that argument about his misdemeanor in the first half, should it have been a red card, he stayed on and he has made his mark. Well Jota has come on to replace Darwin Nunes and it was a lovely ovation for ever Darwin Nunes, that lack of discipline did result in a yellow card, VAR did have a look at a potential red, you never thought they would give a red though, would you? It was a kick out as the ball eventually rolled in the weak spring sunshine towards us. What it was, it was it was Darwin from Darwin, wasn't it, to even give the officials an opportunity to send him off, it was careless and clumsy really as much as anything but Liverpool could have been in a real pickle had he gone. Ultimately I think the yellow was the right decision, Liverpool two, Southampton one, Robertson's early cross in, left corner of the area, Howard Bellis heads it out. Liverpool though have the ball back once again with Robertson, now with Van Dijk, left of the centre circle, mentioned the visit of Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday night, there'll be commentary here on BBC Radio 5 Live as they will from Villapark on Wednesday, Mastin Villa against Bruges, Manchester United against Real Sociedad in the Europa League commentary on Thursday from Old Trafford. Elliott gave Liverpool that priceless lead from Paris in midweek, Canate to Van Dijk, Salah little touch towards Elliott and gives him space to run into on this near side, the right ten yards in from the touch line. Alexander-Arnold's first time cross from the right and arriving was Dias, Southampton get it away, Walker-Peters running back to Fernandez, skips out of the challenge and McAllister runs forward but Liverpool will quickly close down the avenue and Fernandez has to retreat back inside his own heart. You know what though, Archer had made a run, he's one on one with Canate and I think Fernandez has got to try that pass, take a chance, take a risk, try and put Archer through, it wasn't an easy pass to make but I mean how many opportunities at Southampton going to get in this second half. Geltland Festival next week, all 28 races covered for you on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra, the commentary on Tuesday on Sports Extra will be from 1 o'clock Mark Chapman presenting from the course on Friday on Gold Cup Day as Geltland actually have fallen behind to Colchester United but Archer's away here, Archer enters the penalty area right hand side, Archer saved by Allison, stood inside his six-yard area and beat the ball away with both hands. Yeah it's another warning for Liverpool, Archer through right hand side of the box and Van Dijk actually just steadied himself, slowed himself down and said well you try and beat Allison from the angle, I'm backing my goalkeeper and that was a good decision and a comfortable save in the end from Allison down to his right hand side. You'd expect Archer to hit the target but he couldn't beat Allison, it's Liverpool in the penalty area, this is Lewis Diaz, creates the space with a cross and Salah couldn't get the conversion, he was a little bit off balance, he was just outside the six-yard area right footed and it went wide, goal kick Liverpool still lead 2-1, had that been his left foot, I think we would have expected a different outcome. Diaz I wondered whether he could have got a shot off on the corner of the six-yard line, he was unselfish and stabbed the ball up to Salah, he couldn't direct his effort on target. Well this is going to be a really strong ovation for Adam Lallana who comes on for a World Small Vote because he was a £25 million acquisition for Liverpool, six years here, 178 appearances and extremely popular, Adam Lallana comes on. Wonderful footballer, Adam Lallana, stellar career and one thing that Salah's Hampton have missed in this second half is that bit of creativity, cleverness, Guile and we know Adam Lallana has that in spades. 18 minutes remaining, still we have that weak sunshine, Colchester incidentally, when I mentioned that they've taken the lead at Cheltenham, they're unbeaten in 10 in League 2, they're on a really really good run of form with Colchester United, Liverpool lead by two goals to one. It would take them 16 points clear of Arsenal, albeit Arsenal would have two games in hand and one of them will be in five lives Premier League Sunday from midday tomorrow, 430 commentary at Old Trafford, Chelsea Leicester before that at two, Spurs, Bournemouth will be on the BBC Sport website but it's been by and large one-way traffic in this second half, DS from McAllister, stabs it into the path of Robertson, Robertson marauding his way forward, Harwood-Gullis catching out behind for a corner kick. There's a wonderful crossfield ball from Trent Alexander-Arnold to Diaz, must have been 40, 50, 60 yards and then Liverpool are on to them, little ball inside to McAllister, releases Robertson, bit of a heavy touch inside the box and eventually a corner. The corner has worked out to Elliott, enters the area, shoots headed away by Bellacotcha, it was Ramstell who was already diving away towards his right, Wigan Athletic leading Cambridge United by a goal to nil, they dispensed with the services of Sean Maloney last week, did Wigan, so taking temporary charge is Glenn Whelan and they are ahead, Wigan won Cambridge United nil, Robertson, lovely touch out of the air on that left hand side, high on the pitch he wins Let's get an update from Brighton, it's not a corner kick, it's a goal kick, update nevertheless from the Amex with John. Brighton won full-on-one, game just dipped into a bit of a lull but Brighton have brought on March and Wellbeck, and Wellbeck scored the winner in his last two games, he's got about 13 minutes to do it again, Brighton one full-on-one. Tramirobas have come from behind, they lead Bromley by two goals to one, it was a shake of the head in disagreement with Andy Robertson. I thought that was the correct decision, I tell you what is interesting in the sort of ruthlessness from Anna Slott at half-time saying, do you know what, not good enough in the first half, that lack of intensity, I'm going to be positive, make the substitutions and that has proved a really clever decision. Despite that touchline, Vanny is allowed to talk to the players during the halftime interval, that's when he made that change and to good effect as well. So we've heard from Brighton Crystal Palace, it switched Chris Coles. It's still 0-0 but Alex Palmer has saved Ipswich and saved Leaf Davis, woefully short back pass, Daniel Munoz on to it, Palmer out to make a really good save to keep it at Palace, near Ipswich, 0. Here is Ramsdale in the Southampton goal, chipping the ball out towards Manning, Harwood Bellis, eventually will clear for Southampton, Fernandez couldn't get hold of it, McAllister just touches it with the outside of his right group to Van Dijk in the centre circle to stride forward, Barrow 2, Akrington Stanley Nill is the latest score in League 2, we've got about 15 minutes remaining, we'll probably start to rattle through the divisions, of course nothing in Scotland, it's Scottish Cup weekend, Hearts beat Dundee 3-1 last night and Aberdeen beat Queen's Park in the early game by four goals to one, the other two quarter finals, Celtic Hibs is tomorrow and Livingston St. Johnston is being played on Monday night, but the latest scores in League 2, well the two results, Wimbledon 2-0, County Nill, both sides looking still for automatic promotion, Walsall 1, Grimsby Town 3, so the leaders lost, good for Grimsby in their playoff hopes, these are the latest scores, Barrow 2, Akrington Nill as I've mentioned, Cheltenham Nill, Colchester 1, Chesterfield 2, Newport County 1, Doncaster Rovers who were 2-0 up, now drawing 2-2 at home to Swindon Town, Fleetwood and Portbell is goalless, Bradford City had a chance to go to the top of the table but they're losing at Presfield, Jillingham 1, Bradford City Nill, Harrogate Nill, Carlisle United Nill, Carlisle who were bottom of the table, Mark Hughes his team are 4-1 beaten, MK Donnes 2, Morkham 1, Salford City 1, Crew Nill, Tramir Rovers 2, Bromley 1, goal at Sunderland, John Bennett. A big goal for Sunderlanders, they look to cut the gap to the top two, Sunderland 2, Cardiff 1, it's Chris Meppam tapping it in across from the right hand side, right place, right time, Sunderland 2, Cardiff 1. One turn too many by Lewis Diaz, he fell to the floor and Southampton saw it back towards Ramsdale, Mansfield Town have equalised at Stephenage, Stephenage 1, Mansfield Town 1, that is a latest score line from Broadhall Way, the latest scores in League 1, just keep my eye on Archer on that right hand side for Southampton and in the sunshine Gravenburg wins the ball deep inside his own half, the two results incidentally were Crawley 1, Reading 1, so Reading and beaten in 8, Stockport County Nill, Charlton Nill, Charlton who've only now lost one of 11 under Nathan Jones, Barnsley Nill, Blackpool 3, Birmingham leaders 1, Lincoln City Nill, Bristol Rovers 1, Huddersfield Nill, Burton 1, Bolton 2, Exeter leading Shrewsbury 2, Nill, Lake Norrie 1, Northampton Town 2, Peterborough leading Wickham by a goal to Nill, Peterborough looking to go 5 and beaten, Stephenage 1, Mansfield 1 that scoreline I've just mentioned and Wigan 1, Cambridge United Nill while Wrexham lead Rotherham by a goal to Nill, so Wrexham will go second in the table as it currently stands, Chris. Yeah and I think this is how, this is the difference between Arnav Slott's Liverpool and Jürgen Klopp's Liverpool who were brilliant to watch but it's just kept the ball haven't they in sort of recent times trying to draw Southampton onto them, playing at their own pace, slow, slow across the back and then quick whereas a little bit more direct under Klopp and so they go for the kill but they're trying to draw Southampton players out onto them and put them under pressure and then using their superiority to play through them. Crew have got an equaliser at Salford in League 2, Salford 1, Crew 1 is now a latest score but Liverpool are in control leading by two goals to one and Southampton at the moment, Lalaarna is the one who decides to go and press Canate who passes the ball out towards Van Dijk, he hits it forward, Robertson, Howard Balles commits himself with a header, goes out of play from that far side. Frank Lampard, before I give you the championship scores, Gola Crystal Palace. Finally, Ian, finally a chance has taken, Crystal Palace take the lead, Ismail Asar takes this really nicely, bursting into the penalty area, lifts it over Alex Palmer to make it, Palace 1, Ipswich Nill. McAllister forward, looks for Jota, goes behind him, Southampton able to bring the ball clear through Fernandez, so one little at Selhurst Park, Brighton 1 full and one is still a scoreline, Fernandez continued to run, there was no foul there as is the referee, Southampton is bent for a test but Liverpool come forward as the crowd whip up the atmosphere once again inside Anfield with the red and white scars being swung around their heads as they're in the cot, the Saquenidau Gleesh down the Anfield road end, both bottom and top tiers away towards our left hand side and we just 10 overs remain, 10, 10 overs? It was the cream of the sunshine, it fooled me, 10 minutes remaining. Yeah, I've got to say the recovery run from Diaz hands on hips at the moment to get back and make the challenge on Fernandez, sums him up as a player, always had great desire, ability with the ball, without the ball, he's first class as well. That was a googly, almost tripping myself up there, here is it. Full toss. Here is Elliott, Jota gives it back and Alexander Arnold, Southampton again defending very deep, Fleetwood 1, Portbale 0 is the latest score line, here is Salah, stopped by Lallana, dived on by Ramsdale, so earlier on the two results in the championship, what a wonderful job Frank Lampard is doing at Coventry City, they beat Stoke by three goals to two, they've won nine of their last 10 now of Coventry as they consolidated playoff position, Watford 1, Millwall 2 was the other result in the other early game as Bellacotchup steps out of defence for Southampton and chips the ball out towards Sulamana, doesn't reach him, headed forward by a stationery Alexander Arnold, Elliott comes forward, links up with Salah and Elliott shoots, and it was a floated effort off his left foot that was drifting wide, Ramsdale at full flight away towards his right, out for a goal kick. Yeah, always drifting wide I think, 25 yards out, why not take a shot, he just cuts across the ball and Ramsdale flings himself to his right, but as well past five yards, past the right tempo, so the only danger for Liverpool is Cameron Archer picking up a position in between Vanduiken and Robertson and those balls into the right hand channel. The excellent Graven Burke is coming off and Wataru Endo comes on to replace him in the midfield as we go to the Amex and John Southall. Bryton 1, full and one, Bryton pushing for the winner here, Danny Welbeck with a header seven yards out, just drifted wide, great chance that Bryton 1, full and one. And at long last I can give you the latest scores in the championship, Bristol City 1, the 10 men of whole City 1, Burnley 3, the 10 men of Luton Town, Nill. Darby County 2, Blackburn Rovers 1, that would be a first win in 13 for John Eustace against his former club. Plymouth Argyll will go to the bottom of the table as it currently stands, Plymouth Nill, Sheppard Wednesday 3, Sheppard United 1, Preston Northend, Nill, that would take Chris Wilderside level with Leeds United at the top. Sunderland 2, Cardiff 1, Swansea 1, Middlesbrunnell, West from a Chalbion, a down to 10 men, but they still lead Queen's Park Rangers by a goal to Nill. Saller, that thing's way in towards the penalty area with the cross, Bella Cutchup tries to clear, closed down quickly by Jota, Elliott picks it back up for Liverpool, cross from the left-hand side, Harwood Ballas is the one now to run it out of the penalty area, with eight minutes remaining, but it's behind Sulamana, it's a Liverpool throw to what they lead. He was Harwood Ballas who's actually had a pretty decent game, off centre half for Southampton, looking for the runner. There's a good pull in from Mo Saller, looking for the run in behind of Sulamana, he didn't move and eventually tried to play a short ball and it went out for a throw in. Here is Van Dijk, back out towards Lewis Dias, they might have thought of an improbable victory at halftime, the St supporters have made that long journey up from the south coast, but Liverpool came out a different animal altogether in the second half, and as they win the ball again with Jota, Harwood Ballas tries to shield Jota away, and there was a foul on Harwood Ballas, three kicks out Hampton. That is defended well, Harwood Ballas, yeah, fair play to all those Southampton fans who have made the trip, I mean that is absolute loyalty. This season they have seen a pile of dross, haven't they? Let's get it right, but that's absolute commitment from them, and today first half their team actually did them proud. Jo Aribo and Paul Anuatu are the two players coming on, as the two players going off Ugochukwu and Manning. Yeah, they're risking now gambling, two central strikers who will play up against the Liverpool centre-backs and leave them wide open in the middle of the park. Even Urochukwu only had 12 games before he departed Roma last autumn, signing the 18-month deal in December. It is another sinking feeling for Southampton who are rooted to the bottom of the Premier League. 13 points adrift of safety from the start of play, and with Wolverhampton Wanderers against Everton at eight o'clock tonight at Mollinieu, Wolves might have an opportunity to pull further clear. It's which town remember, five points adrift of Wolves are behind at Crystal Palace. Ball over the top towards Diaz. Sugawara, Diaz tries to get there, oh, and then Harwood Ballas has gone on for a 50-50 challenge with Lewis Diaz. The ball has been kept in play, but Lewis Diaz hasn't moved. That really looks about challenge for Lewis Diaz. He was at full pelt going into it with Harwood Ballas. Both players went to Groundy and these are always awkward situations because they're both making a genuine attempt to play the ball. It's good that Diaz has actually sat up. But first of all, I wondered whether there's a handball. I think it is a handball from Sugawara who moves his arm towards the ball. Liverpool should be awarded a penalty. This will go to VAR. And then the challenge from Harwood Ballas, he's really committed. So is Diaz. But I'm pretty sure a penalty will be awarded here. It should be awarded. It should be. But then that collision and you're just thinking about Diaz. They need him fit, don't they? Deliverpool, the threat he carries, whether it was a central striker. Yep. A wide player off the left-hand side. Good to see both sets of the two players on their feet as the referee, Lewis Smith, has been ordered to go across to the screen by Matt Donahue, the VAR. But there was a movement of the arm by Sugawara. Yeah, it's a nudge with the right elbow. It's really stupid defending because he's inside Diaz. He doesn't need to do that. He could let the ball bounce and there'd still be an awkward situation to deliver. Paul to score from there. This will be 100% awarded as a penalty. If it's not in, I'll leave my hat. Well, if that is the case, I'll help you easy. That's it's brainless defending it is. It's needless. Doesn't need to move his arm towards the ball. It doesn't need to take this long to look at it either. As soon as you see it once, you know that that's a penalty. Incidentally, Paris Saint-Germain are away at red and at half time, it's red-nil Paris Saint-Germain won. That's the opposition for Liverpool on Chief United. As the penalty has been awarded, he's already scored from the spot once today, has Mo Salah. His record from the penalty spot, incidentally, for Liverpool, he's missed eight of 51 spot kicks. And this season, after that one earlier on, it is 10 from 11 as he places the ball down. Liverpool lead to one. VAR quite rightly giving a penalty. Sugawara has been penalised with three minutes remaining. This has an opportunity to wrap it up for the league. What do you do? Do you go the same way and what would you do? I did it. I probably miss it from him. Here is Salah. Straight run-off against Ramsdale. This is a chance to go. Level with Sergio Aguero, joint fifth in the all-time Premier League scoring charts. Once again, makes that movement to his right. It's emphatic. Mo Salah rarely misses. Left foot, it covers the ball past Ramsdale. Another goal from the spot for Salah and another step towards the title for Liverpool. Three-one. Blimey. He meant that, didn't he? Three goals. Three points for Liverpool. 16 points clear. Ramsdale thought he was going the same way. And he wraps his foot around it into the top corner to Ramsdale's left-hand side. Liverpool in this second half, Blimey. They've been outstanding and they have blown the Sorrey Saints away. What a penalty that is. Hammered in. You can hear the cries, Ian. The Liverpool fans. I don't think they're wrong. Are you going to believe us? We're going to win the league. A Salah breakery field inside Anfield. Mo Salah moves onto 184 in the Premier League. Level with Sergio Aguero. Only Andy Cole is a matter of three goals away from Mo Salah, as Quonset is going to be coming on for Liverpool as well. As there's been a try at Murrayfield, Jamie Lyon. And it belongs to Scotland. Throwback, Blair Kinghorn bursting down the left-hand side with the home team's first attack of the day. They lead Wales in the Six Nations match by five points to three with just six minutes played. commentary on sports. Extra console replace Trent Alexander-Arnold. It's Liverpool leading by three goals to one as the empty spaces start to appear a near way end for a league of Southampton. Brighton full of John Southall. Can't get to John just at this moment. And no of the latest scores to tell you about, but it's one-one there at the AmEx. Crystal Palace lead, Ipswich by a goal to nil. Cometry to come. Brentford-Aston Villa at 5.30. Sports report on its way with Mark Chapman on five live. We're also live on the World Service and BBC Sounds this afternoon. There might have been an Arsenal supporter at half-time with Southampton leading thinking, okay, 13 points behind, two games in hand, still to come to Anfield on May the 10th. Liverpool now though have turned it around second period, 16 clear. Yep, absolutely decisive substitutes. But half-time raising the level of play second half. This has been the Liverpool we've been accustomed to this season. We shall not be moved is now the latest chance for the Anfield crowd. Arsenal reeled in Manchester United in 97-98. Liverpool will take some stopping. They're leading by three goals to one as we go to the AmEx and John. Well, it's Brighton one full and one. We've got one minute left to play here. Brighton pushing forward for this winning goal, but they're running out of time. Brighton one full and one. We're not running out of time. We've got another seven minutes remaining of added on time. So a minimum of seven, which will take us close to five o'clock in sports report on BBC Radio 5 Live. Reminder that India-New Zealand champions Trophy cricket final will be on Sports Extra at nine in the morning. Cheltenham Festival all the racing next week on Five Live and Sports Extra. A coverage on Sports Extra starts at one o'clock on Tuesday as Liverpool, with some defending to do now here. With the exception of that archer effort saved from Allyson, it has been all Liverpool second period. Oh, that's happened on a penalty here. Walker Peters left-hand side of the box. Quanta. That's it. Walker Peters goes down. I feel this contact. Obviously, VAR will be looking at this. Mark Hughes, Carlisle United and beaten in four since Mark Hughes, that's four games. Harrogate Town, they've got an injury time winner in North Yorkshire. Harrogate Town one, Carlisle United nil. So bottom of the table lead to Carlisle. Four behind. Here is Salah. He's on a hat-trick. Ball played by McAllister to Van Dijk now towards DS. And Sugawaro, who gave away that penalty with that needless handball, kills another play for a throw. Much more like Liverpool second half. Yep, absolutely. They know what they wanted to do, know that they slipped under the level in the first half, but the second half they've been excellent. They've been slicker, faster, sharper, braver, and they're press braver in the play. Certainly got the rewards. They've blown this Southampton team away. Looking to go unbeaten in 25 in the Premier League since the only defeat of the league campaign against Nottingham Forest when we were here together back in mid-September. You think that Liverpool have dropped five points against Nottingham Forest? They've dropped 12 points in the other 27 games that they've played in the top flight, leading by three goals to one. Aribo will run forward on that far side for Southampton. Looking for the run ahead of him. Gathering it in with Alisson. Port Vale have got an injury time equaliser in league two. Fleetwood one, Port Vale one. Swansea City have beaten Middlesbrough. That's a blow to Michael Carrick and their playoff hopes. They were only two points off the playoffs, but they've lost in South Wales. Sunderland have beaten Cardiff by two goals to one, but there's a late penalty at the Amex. John Southall. We are in the 97th minute of the game. Brighton one, full of one, and Brighton have a penalty. Jowell Pedro, just nicked by Harrison Reid, went down by the far post, and Pedro will take the penalty. Seven goals so far this season, two from two in the league. Burn Leno, the hero at Old Trafford in the penalty shootout awaits. There's a hush that just goes round the stadium. Remember Brighton have never beaten Fulham in the Premier League. This is their 10th chance to do so. Jowell Pedro just waits, steps up, and he puts it into the bottom right hand corner. The keeper went the right way, and the Amex erupts. Brighton have pinched it. Brighton two, full of one. And Brighton looking for a fourth successive win in the top flight as Wickham Wanderer, second in league one, have got an injury time equaliser at London Road. Peterborough one, Wickham one. Southampton attacking on the edge of the area, and Virgil van Dijk will get the ball away. So two late goals. Now the last we heard, Wrexham were leading, still leading Wutherham by a goal to Nill, but at the top of the table, it means that Wickham remain second. And there's been another late goal. It's at Turfmore, Katie Smith. And it's Burnley four, Luton Town Nill. They put four past them in the reverse fixture. They've done it again today. This one for Ashley Barnes slamming into the roof of the net. Burnley four, Luton Nill. Low cross comes in from the left hand side. On that you just couldn't get the touch. It'll go out of play on that far side. Bristol City one, whole City one is how it's finished, and Jillingham have beaten Bradford City by a goal to Nill. So Bradford missed out on the chance to go top of league two. Just a slight worry for Liverpool. Virgil van Dijk hobbling. Well, he is, isn't he? Yeah, that's not a good look. Hopefully it will be nothing from Liverpool's perspective that maybe just took a little knock in the box there. Yeah, just keep an eye on that one. Paris Saint-Germain to come on Tuesday night, live on five live. League cup final next Sunday against Newcastle United, live on five lives. So much live football to look forward to as we'll get news of that. Wiccan equaliser from Adam Witty. Yeah, Richard Coney's got a nine minute hat check the last time the team's met. Might have stolen and in fact has stolen a draw for Wiccan full-time here. One all Wiccan, goes second on goal difference as it looked like. Wiccan might leapfrog them at one stage. Full-time, Peter will one Wiccan one. Yeah, Wiccan remaining second despite that leading for Wiccan as Canate leads the charge out of defence. Ono Akshu goes with him. And Ono Akshu is shown a yellow card as he gives away a free kick to Liverpool. It was a marauding run to the back by Canate. Ono Slott wants to see that centre back pairing in the 97th minute, steaming forward. It's the game's Liverpool have coming up, but he wins the free kick. Commentary to come from Brentford Aston Villa, then Chris Sutton and Robbie Savitz taking your call 08 08 5 9 0 9 6 9 3. Not just about the Premier League, but also in the in the championship League 1, League 2 or indeed Scotland. You set the agenda as always with Chris and Robbie. We're inside the last 60 seconds of the minimum of seven to be added on here at Anfield and this free kick in front of the Cop End where three second half goals have turned it around for Liverpool with a much improved performance, increasing the tempo and deservedly leading now 3-1. Elliott stands over the free kick, Elliott left footed, slides it in low and cleared by Sulamana and Canate will just take it on the chest and stroke it back towards Alisson. That's a strange free kick actually. It's just ended up side-footing the ball. Look at there trying to find a Liverpool player but sides putting it straight to the Southampton Defender and he made the clearance. Robertson at a nice gentle walking pace will take that throw in on the left hand side. So what are your thoughts then Chris for this game? Well thoughts are Liverpool is all about the three points hard work made hard work of it in the first half went behind surprisingly and Alisson error you don't say that very often. Second half changes made a half time decisive changes on the slot not messing around and it was a different Liverpool in the second half Darwin Nunes has an incident with him in the first half but we've got the the equalising goal and then two Mo Salah penalties three big points 16 points the gap now that is an enormous gap to Arsenal and Liverpool on course for the Premier League title still works to do though but an important three points. A sweet 16 for Liverpool small bone slotted Southampton ahead on the stroke of half time but in the second half Nunes and two penalties from Mo Salah mean that Liverpool the league leaders stretch their unbeaten run in the top flight to 25 games it's finished Liverpool three Southampton one",
