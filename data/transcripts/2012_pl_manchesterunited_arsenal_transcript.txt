 Then Nani on the right, Anderson Cleverly, Young, Welbeck and Rooney. And the Manchester United bench today includes people like Ferdinand Berbatov, Giggs and Hernandez on the Arsenal bench. Well, young men like Ozzy Yakup and Sunoo, who neither of whom has appeared in the Premier League. So Manchester United will play to Autiel Strepeden in the first half and right to left. Howard Webb is the referee, Arsenal in the chainstrip with Navy Blue and Turquoise. And we're about to get underway. Mark, final thought before the game? I just think Arsenal need to be really strong here, mate. I'm not sure they've got it in them, in all honesty. They've got so many inexperienced players, it's going to need the better players to play above themselves today to get any semblance of a positive result. Sam Alladies saying to us before the game that they need some possession. And they could really have done with Jack Wilshire out there today and Song in midfield, but they have to get on with it on what is quite a blustery afternoon. Totally misjudged the weather here, by the way. I thought it was August and it's freezing. As Clarence, a very nervous Clarence from Shejnay, is charged down by Danny Welbeck and it's going to be a goal kick to Arsenal. He just stumbled a little bit on his left foot and he thought, oh, Cracky, I've got to kick it with my left foot. And it just bought half a second for Welbeck to close the kick out down. So welcome to our coverage on Five Live of Manchester United against Arsenal. Arsenal yet to score in the Premier League this season. If they don't do it today, that'll be the first time it's happened since the 50s. Johnny Evans wearing number six this season. It used to be 23, of course. Now, Ashley Young near side, the Manchester United left. He's got three or four Arsenal players around him and he works it neatly to Anderson. Anderson running square with the ball at the moment, followed by Ramsey inside the centre-circle. Anderson checks and then he feeds Cleverley. The first time he's on the ball here. Cleverley into Welbeck. Welbeck's ball towards Rooney doesn't reach him. Juru clears, but it comes straight back to the home side once more. And the first touch in the game for De Haer outside of the penalty area. Just knocks it with his foot to Johnny Evans and United just hold. Ever is urging Evans to get rid of it. Now, Anderson back again to Evans. Evans back to goalkeeper De Haer. I think this Arsenal had sort of gone 4-5-1, which, I'm personally, would be the one, but on the wings, they're kind of going to push Walcott on the right forward and now Chavin on the left forward when they've got the ball to try and make it a 4-3-3. Anderson wants more, taking on Ramsey and doing well to hold onto it because Ramsey was determined in the tackle there and now Nani for Manchester United. Nani up against Cochaland, the youngster, looking to try and release Smalling. Smalling into the penalty area. Arsenal don't get it away. Shot from Cleverley just wide and Arsenal didn't deal with that and it was great running from Chris Smalling and it's a goal kick. Great running and strength, Mike, as well, which is very, very important. Also, when he got himself in the penalty area before he was stumbling, he saw that Cleverley was just hanging around on the edge of the penalty area where he played the ball back to him. He had to hit it early, Cleverley, and hit it with a little bit of pace, but no direction. It's very interesting. Smalling's looking the part at right back. Of course, they do have Rafael and Fabio as well, the young Brazilians. Gary Neville now having retired. The last time United played Arsenal this last season in the FA Cup, Fabio and Rafael both played as wingers in that game, I remember, in a 2-0 home win. Now, Jenkinson stabs the ball towards Van Persie, easy cut out by Evans and Anderson now into Welbeck. Good control from him. Good movement from Manchester United. Young back to Evans once more and Evans will give it to goalkeeper De Herre, just reminding you once again that Manchester City have won 5-1 today away to Spurs. What's the story of Anne Cochaland and the Arsenal holding midfield player? Do we know? Well, he's a player that Arsene Benga, he likes to do, sent out on loan to Lorion in France. And here comes Clevely... You're winding me up, by the way, aren't you? No, no, awesome! Here comes Ashley Young of Manchester United. You know that I was pouring over the research before the game. If you're really interested, I'll carry on. No, you're right. OK, thank you. It's Arsene Bynfour, Arsenal over on the far side, and he's lost the ball easily, cheaply really. Nani for Manchester United, Wellbeck, difficult control. Try to find Ashley Young on his left-hand side. Juru at full stretch, clears, into wall-cop, first time you mention him and he doesn't hold on to the ball. Wellbeck to Young. Rooney in good position down the left-hand side. Rooney cuts in and then tries a shot at the goalkeeper, and Shezny holds onto it and throws it out to Riziski. Yeah, well played, Ashley Young. He played the ball into Rooney on the left-hand side, then ran behind him, so he distracted the right back a little bit. Rooney comes inside and hits a decent shot, but comfortable save, certainly. Manchester United nil, Arsenal nil. Howard Webb's given Arsenal the free kick in the centre-circle. With great relief, they're about to take it. Riziski now, across the field to Traorey. The left back, now Riziski. It's very slow from Arsenal. Now Kokoland, just inside the centre-circle. Arsenal just trying to get a foothold here, just trying to get some possession. Juru, good ball, Kokoland slips it away from Anderson. Now Riziski to Van Persie. This is good play from Arsenal. It's Kokoland looking for the best option, calling for it. Arshavin over on the left. Van Persie in the penalty area. Here comes Arshavin, taking on Chris Smalling. Traorey's made a run. Arshavin's layoff. Traorey cuts it back, header away by Jones. Still not completely clear. Jenkinson tries a shot, charged down by Ever of Manchester United. Ball on the edge of the United area, and now Young clears, and that's the first real sign we've seen from Arsenal. Yeah, Arshavin did really well, actually. Just waited for Traorey to over that and played him a perfect ball where he didn't have to break his stride and just cross it into the United box. A problem for Arsenal, not enough whatever colour shirts they've got on in there. What are they, by the way? Well, I thought... sort of Navy and Turquoise. I thought when we were here on Monday night for the Spurs game, there was a big example of the contrast between the way United play and the way Arsenal play. When Wellbeck scored, I noticed when the cross came over, there were four United players in the penalty area. And that's always been Arsenal's problem, but now it's Arshavin. Looking to try and find van Persie. The door was closed by Evans, bit brighter from Arsenal, but it's Nil Nil at Old Trafford, and now Ashley Young taking on the full-back Jenkinson. Jenkinson just holding him, tight to the line. Young will have to get rid of this. Young now sweeps it across to the far side, smalling just inside the Arsenal half, into Nani, back again to smalling. United, Nil, Arsenal, Nils, smalling to Nani. Traorey didn't cut it out. Nani looking to work it in, and there are three United players in the penalty area, and it goes, Rooney jumps early but couldn't jump high enough, and it's gone behind for Golcic. Well, already, United are starting to test Arsenal at the back. Young was trying to run at Jenkinson before down, Manchester United is left. Nani there just cut inside Traorey, and he's clipped a ball with the outside of his right foot, which wasn't a bad cross at all. It really just couldn't quite reach. Threatening Sky ahead, it's going to rain in the next five minutes, I think. It's Nil Nil here, and it's Ashley Young of Manchester United. Ball play through! Wellbeck's onside, Wellbeck into the penalty area, and he shoots wide, should have done better. Kishelny tried to close him down. It's a fantastic ball to find Wellbeck, and he should have really had that one on target. Arsenal survived. Yeah, he didn't really take the ball well, Mike, when it was passed to him. He almost lost himself a half second, by the way. He didn't shape his body to take the ball. The other thing as well is, once he got in the penalty area, he could have had another touch, because Kishelny would have had to bring him down and foul him. That could have been penalty and red, of course. Has to make the most of his opportunities. Wellbeck, when he starts with people like Burbotoff and Hernandez, waiting to come on from the bench. Evans now looking to return it. No, he doesn't. He clips the ball over his head, tries to find Wellbeck. And Arsenal now trying to get hold of it once more in midfield. Ramsey, fouled by Ramsey on Wellbeck, given by Howard Webb, three-kick to Manchester United. Sorry, you'd also be extremely worried how there was that massive gap, the sort of right-sided Arsenal centre-back, but it was nowhere near. It wasn't as though Wellbeck had to make a clever run. Manchester United, Nill, Arsenal, Nill. A much-changed Arsenal, five changes, it's Rooney on the ball now for Manchester United. And it goes to Young! Ashley Young and Manchester United just has to hold things up, didn't take it. In his stride, Jura was there with Kishelny. Arsenal clear, but I tell you what, they were split again, Mark. They were split again, and I think Ashley Young's seemed to get the ball stuck underneath his feet, otherwise he'd have gone past the Arsenal defender. Now, Walcott, Arshavin, but no return ball from Arshavin. They could really do with the performance from him today, Arsenal, as the ball is thrown out by Deherre, and it's Chris Smalling of Manchester United. They've been saying he could do with the performance from Arshavin for six months. Nani now, looking to clip it over the top towards Rooney, headed away by Kishelny, and now Treyori to Rizitsky, one of the experienced players in this Arsenal team today. Lovely running now from Treyori over on the Arsenal left, and Percy trying to stay onside. Treyori still needs support now, and in the end, van Persie slipped, as the ball was played through to him, and Manchester United looking to try and counterattack now, with Nani over on the right. Manchester United, 0, Arsenal 0, 8.5 minutes gone. The ball fired down the right-hand side. Welbet will get the ball by the corner flag. Rooney's in the penalty area. Ashley Young's trying to join him. The ball with Nani now, on the edge of the area, right edge. Little reverse ball doesn't work, and Arsenal defend, and Rizitsky plays it early to Walcott. Walcott up against Everett. Everett's just holding him. Walcott now, facing the right way. Everett easily takes it away from him. Easy steal for Everett. And Manchester United now playing it through midfield. Cleverly looking to release. Welbet, great running for a Welbet. Welbet turns in the penalty area, lays it to the right-hand side. Young against... ...Coccoland. There was an appeal rather halfheartedly, I think, from most of the crowd, but not the players, for a push there. Wasn't given by Howard Webby. Waves play on. Get marked to talk about that in a moment, as Ramsey's getting in trouble here against Rooney. But the ball falls kindly for goalkeeper<|tr|><|zh|>ais Gesney, who clears to Treori Farseye. What do you think of that? I thought Coplan was just stronger, Mike. I thought his desire to get the ball was better than that of the youngs, in all honesty. Not only do we have the threat of rain, I think we've got the threat of a Manchester United goal here. What, a threat to another lanche at the moment. But it's still 0-0, and we've played nearly 10 minutes of the first half. On a day when Manchester City have beaten Spurs 5-1 in London with four goals from Giacomo and the other one from Aguero. Now, Ashley Young forward. A busy day for Kishelny up against Rune, fouled by Rune. I don't think he touched him. I really seriously didn't think he touched him. Howard Rebb obviously got a much better view than those in his ten yards away, there must have been some contact, but I never saw that. They're being overworked here as Ramsey's fouled by Cleverly. I don't know where he did that, really. Anyway, free kick is given to Arsenal just inside the Manchester United half. It just takes a bit of the pressure away from Arsenal. And Ramsey, who's really had to step forward into this Arsenal team now in the absence of Wilshire and Song and, of course, Fabricas and Nazary. And Kokoland now finds Troy Ori over on the Arsenal left-hand side. Back again to Kokoland. It's a little bit slow from Arsenal. Now, Juru, the Swiss international, 15 yards inside the United half, flips the ball into Van Persie. Van Persie's headed down. Rzitzki onto Wolcott. Wolcott inside the penalty area. Now, Van Persie takes over. Van Persie trying to get some space here on the edge of the penalty area. It'll drop to Rzitzki, and now Wolcott wants more. But the initial move broke down. Wolcott again, took it early and fires it easily wide. It was just a chance there for Arsenal, but it just didn't run for them. Yeah, this was a split second. Look, that numbers in a little bit of space in Manchester United's penalty area, but it pitted out. De Haer, who had a couple of dodgy moments in the second half, yet to be tested in this game. 11 minutes gone. Manchester United nil, Arsenal nil. Arsenal's only win in recent times in the Premier League. Was that one nil against United at the end of last season with Ramsey's goal? Rooney now to Wellbeck. Wellbeck surrounded by Arsenal players. Wellbeck too strong for Rzitzki. It was a very poor attempt by Rzitzki to win the ball. Clips in by Nani. Wellbeck with a flicked header. And that's going to be a corner. No, goal kick. I think it should have been a corner. I thought certainly Wellbeck just got in front of the defender. It looked like the defender might have had the last touch. I'll tell you what, we've got Terry Neil sitting down here, of course, who was a former Arsenal defender and Arsenal manager with Don Howe. And he'd have been watching on. And I mean, that challenge from Rzitzki was so hard-hearted, Mark, wasn't it? Powered up. It really was. And that really wasn't the Arsenal way, of course, under Terry Neil. And then George Graham in particular. Mike, Vieram Petty. Yeah. He obviously didn't want to get his boots dirty, did he? Throw into Arsenal. Jenkinson, who's really having to grow up quickly in the Premier League. Summer signing from Charlton. Jenkinson to take it. Not much on for him. Howard Wood wants him to get on with it. Throws the ball in towards his captain, Van Persie. Evera heads it out for another throw into Arsenal. Manchester United, Neil. Arsenal, Neil. 12 minutes gone. Van Persie's jumped under every high ball so far. And my count is four at the moment. Jenkinson into Van Persie once more. This time Evans takes it on the chest. Young, very tight for United near side. Wellbeck onto Ashley Young. Good movement from Ashley Young. Onto Wellbeck and now Rooney. Back again to Young. And back again to Young once more from Wayne Rooney. Now they need a bit of width over on the far side. Smallings there, United right. Nani, back again to Smalling. Cleverley wants to join in. Everybody from United wanting the ball here. Down that right-hand side. And now in field to Cleverley on the edge of the area. Cleverley shot is blocked by Kishelmi. And now Razitzki gives the ball away and United are back in business once more. Nani, it really is a seed here. Ball in from Smalling. Clipped away once more by Kishelmi. And the throw to United. And you can sense from the crowd here that they feel the first goal is not too far away potentially. Throw to United, 0-0. Anderson. And now Nani. Nani turning with Arsenal defenders. And now Smalling gallops down the right-hand side but this time won't get it. And it's a goal kick. But I don't think Smalling spent any time in his own half in these opening 30 minutes or so. Very, very little and quite right. He's making our chev, and basically have to run backwards towards his own goal while we can reach a 40-minute. Think about Smalling, Mark. There's often a product from him as well, isn't there, down that right-hand side? He's galloping forward and often... There's something at the end of it too, as... Jones, we haven't mentioned him yet. Climes and Beats van Persie in the air. Now here goes Kokoland. Kokoland against Cleverley. Really good defending in midfield by Cleverley. Anderson gives it back to him once more. The movement is better from Manchester United. Anderson now onto Nani, who's deserted that right-hand position. But no Smalling is there. Jones now on the halfway line. Jones into Cleverley again. Manchester United nil, Arsenal nil, Rune rather. And now Patrice Evera. Evera for Anderson. Anderson... Going through the centre-circle. They're singing Patrick Vieira's name around the crowd, for some reason. Anyway, Arsenal thought they were going to go forward, but there's a foul over on the far side. Jones has got caught on the ankle. Jones has been caught, and Howard Webb just moves across to see... What is it, a back problem? No, it's his ankle, I think. And it's Arshavin. The court seems to catch him. We've got a note, have we, from our producer here, Kokoland? Got a yellow, Arshavin. Oh, right, OK. Kokoland was discovered by Gilles Grimondi. OK. And he's a fullback, really, I think, isn't he, by trade? And... Oh, red. Yeah. And he's playing because he has to in defensive midfield today, in the absence of people like Frimpong and Son. Jones is not moving too well at the moment. Got Rio Ferdinand on the bench today, by the way. He'll be fine, Jones. It's just a kick, mate. Shorthabbie Gopelo, although he's been named in the other 21s, I'm sure Gopelo will perhaps fancy him for the senior squad when he announces it tonight. You'll hear that on Five Live. Later this evening with John Murray. Throw to Manchester United. And, er... Franco Baldini's here today. Javier Gopelo's right-hand man for a few more months, at least. Manchester United over on the far side. Nil-nil with Arsenal, but Arsenal are holding on here. The ball is with Nani. Nani now with a chance to witness one in, and he's won a corner. 15 minutes gone, corner to Manchester United, far side the right, Anderson to take. Yeah, Gopelo was at Tottenham's game, wasn't he? And he was at the Villa Walls game, suffering yesterday, I think, at lunchtime, too. So, corner kick to United, Nil-nil, Anderson to take. It's small, he's gone to the near post, and that was a flat by Chezny. He could have held on to that one, but he decided to punch it. Pat Rice is urging everybody out of defence as he stands down there in the technical area. And the ball breaks for Arshavin now. Counterattack from Arsenal, perhaps. Now, can Arshavin do something here? Lays it to the left. Van Persie up against Jones. We'll try and turn the defender. Van Persie's ball in, runs right across the face of goal, and Ashley Young clears. Into Cokaland, inside the centre-circle. Now, Rzitzki, as Anderson tries to come back to hold him up. The ball is with Jenkinson, the fallback. Jenkinson slips as he tries to deliver, gets another chance. In it goes, header up by Jones, poor though. Straight to Ramsey of Arsenal. Ramsey's surrounded immediately by Cleverley and Anderson. Still Ramsey, Van Persie waiting in the area. It's taken too long. Now it goes to the left. Troyor is in space. Van Persie, Walcott and Arshavin in the penalty area. Ramsey again, trying to unlock this United defence. He sees Rzitzki on the right unmarked. Rzitzki shoots, wildly. Oh, got a deflection. Yeah, Kemal Fandersen. Yeah, Kemal Fandersen, didn't he? But before, when Ramsey was on the ball, there was absolutely no movement for him whatsoever. He had nowhere to go for ages. Good noise from the Arsenal fans in the meantime. They may not make any noise at the Emirates, but they are here at Old Trafford. Four or five thousand of them away to our right. It's a corner kick to Arsenal near side of the field. Nil-nil and Robin Van Persie to take the corner. Juru's gone into the penalty area. In goes the corner kick. The header doesn't come for it. And it's headed away by Kishelny off-balance behind. And it's a goal kick to Manchester United. The header didn't want to know that. Well, he came a little bit. He came a little bit, came about three or four yards out, and then decided he wasn't going to get there, which was the right decision in the end. That was probably the most alarming thing, wasn't it? The game against Spurs, where he just completely failed in the air. Yeah. And they nearly scored. They hit the post, didn't they? I think we know we talked about... I think about being a goalkeeper for Manchester United. You've got to have massive concentration, Mike. Long spells in a game where your team has a ball all the time and all of a sudden break away. That's when you have to make the save. I wonder if it was a little bit down to that. They lost the great Dutchman, Van Desaar. The Dutchman that's been catching my eye in goal this season, has been Swansea's goalkeeper, who really has started the season really well. Now, we've got an injury problem to Everett, I think. Cleverley as well. Oh, Cleverley too. Everett's just going to have a drink of water, and Cleverley's got a cut. And he's right eye. So if you're joining us, 19 minutes gone at Old Trafford. Tottenham won Manchester City 5, was the big result earlier. Newcastle beat Fulham by two goals to one. Nottingham Forest won West Ham 4 in the championship. Celtic had a 2-0 win against St. Mirren. Rangers are one up against Aberdeen. Watford are trailing 1-0 at home to Birmingham City. Those are the latest scores, as Cleverley has treatment for a problem with an eye. A little cut above it, I think. It's one of those nicks that actually bleeds profusely. I don't think it's going to be that bad. Got the stick on it. We've played 20 minutes. It's 0-0. It's been mainly Manchester United. Arsenal had a few moments on the break, and now here come United. Lovely running from Nani at Trioeri in the end. Covers Nani. I think they're appealing that Trioeri got his boot in there, and they're saying it was a back pass, but it wasn't. It went to the goalkeeper. So United at the moment down to 10 men. As Jenkinson burst down the right-hand side, near side. Walcott and Van Persie are waiting. Goes to Rositski. Cleverley's still off the field. Rositski took too long there against Patrice Evera. Rooney doesn't cut it out, and it's Ramsey now. Into feet for Walcott. Walcott taking on Johnny Evans. Walcott slid the ball across, and it was too far away from Robin Van Persie, and it goes behind the flag over on the far side for Manchester United's goal kick. Yeah, I think because of his pace there, when he broke, I don't think anyone, even Van Persie, could have realised or could have probably got in there on the end of it. Balance of power at the moment in the game? Still Manchester United. Sir Alex Ferguson probably disappointed. Well, that doesn't get it. Yeah, Fisch played two or three minutes with ten men. The Hares kick out of the area to Anderson, gets it back again, and then gives it accurately to Jones, who's recovered from that injury, down the right-hand side. And a feel for handball, it's given, I think, against Arshavin. Free kick to Manchester United. Say you what, he's a lucky boy. He's been booked, don't forget, hasn't he? Yes, he has. Early on, wasn't he? Yeah, he got booked for the clash with Jones. Right. Now, great running from Evera, near side, United's left, Arsenal galloping back, Evera in the penalty area, slides it in behind everybody. And Arsenal clear it was Treore, who booted it to this near side. Mike, that was very quick from Evera, and in the end it was played behind them all. You didn't see Jenkinson's position, he was actually in midfield. I don't know what happened to him. Throw in taken. Ashley Young of Manchester United, little back heel from Young, got the call from Evera. Evera's ball in towards Rooney, good header away from Kisheldi, drops to Anderson though. Anderson loops it in towards Welbeck, Jiru struggling. Welbeck's header and the goal for Manchester United. It's been coming, 21.5 minutes gone. Kisheldi really at fault, should have cut it out. Welbeck scores and it's Manchester United one, Arsenal nil and another goal for Danny Welbeck. Yeah, well played, Danny Welbeck, because he got himself in there and he just bustled the Arsenal centre-backs out in the way it was just like a flick past edge of the box from Anderson, it bounced. As it bounced, Welbeck just attacked it and the two central defenders, Jiru and Vimal and almost were statuettes, never moved. And Welbeck, he's pinched the goal there. I think I read a stat that Welbeck's last five goals have all been headers in the Premier League, well, there's another one. Manchester United one, Arsenal nil. It was always going to be a really, really big ask for this Arsenal team. Here today, it's even more so now. Once more, the defence has been found wanting. Danny Welbeck's taken full advantage, it's one nil at the halfway point at the first half, and here's Alan Green. Well, I blame Kisheldi and Jiru. Well, more Jiru, Jiru just sort of got himself out of the way. At least Kisheldi then came and tried to challenge. Absolutely awful defending by Arsenal. Goodness gracious. They don't need a sense of that, though. It is terrible. Here's Evera from Manchester United, rushing forward, Bolzer in the penalty area, tries to regain his footing, also tries to block Jenkins' authentic clearance. Won back by Nani, he finds Evera and Arsenal a goal down. And very easily this could get into a right. Well, Jenkins in that... The play so badly, Arsenal. The right back looks and is playing as a very inexperienced player. Rooney towards Smalling, into the penalty area. Smalling in his right foot shoots across the physical wide. Well, you're brilliant to get himself in there, an engineer half a yard. And you know what he's done Alan, a classic defender in the opposition penalty area, he's tried to hit it too hard. Too many poor performances by Arsenal players, particularly in defence. Too many passengers further upfield, like Rosinski or Chavin, and I've got to say Van Persing. Walk-ups done nothing. Goodness. They are a complete shambles. A-Shaven though, sprints forward, can't find walk-up with a pass. It's played back by Cleverney, Dehaa. His clearance, not collected properly by Welbeck. Here's Ramsey, one of the few Arsenal players who doesn't deserve criticism at the moment. 24 minutes played here in five-live at Old Trafford. Manchester United won Arsenal nil after Manchester City won 5-1 at Tottenham earlier today. Oh. They are breathtakingly poor Arsenal. Ramsey. They're ordinary. Traorie on the far side of the field. Traorie now approaching the United Penalty Air, tackled by Smalling and the ball breaks kindly for United, and then the clearance by Jones wasn't collected by Nani's. It should have been, and it's out for an Arsenal throw-in. I think it needed to be Nani's feet. There's no... Jones had time to bring the ball down and pass it on the carpet. Throw-in for Arsenal goes back to Ramsey. And Ramsey towards the near side, and Juru probably most culpable for Welbeck's goal. Now, Kokolant is actually young quite well for young Clea. Out of position as a holding midfielder. Yeah. Gets the ball again. Just left of the centre-circle Kokolant. Whereas the win, there isn't any at the moment. It's with Rzitzki. Rzitzki now to the right full-back Jankensen. Midway inside the United half. Rzitzki wants more. Walkock and Van Persie central. Rzitzki goes to Walkot, who'd come off the United defence. Finds our Chavitt back towards Walkot. Walkot bull down. Pernaldi kick, surely. Evans was at fault. No question. Yeah, actually, Young's just gone to berate the fourth official. Furnace to him. His flag went across his chest straight away. Straight away. Theo Walkot got half a yard on Johnny Evans. It just looked like Johnny Evans just clipped him as Walkot was about to run onto the ball. What would be interesting to see, Alan, whether he was actually going to get that ball before it went out? Well, he pulled the player back. It's a penalty kick, without question. And now, completely against the run of play, Arsenal have an opportunity to level the scoreline. It's the new captain, Van Persie. De Haer in goal. Right. Big moment for the new Manchester United goalkeeper. Even more important for the new Arsenal captain. His side trailing 1-0 here at Old Trafford. 27 minutes play. Hard web, trying to make sure everybody's back where they are. Here comes Van Persie. Left for Chubb! Saved by De Haer. Terrible penalty. Yeah, very good save, though. What will that do to his conference, by the way? I just thought it was a weak penalty by Van Persie. Goalkeeper mix the choice of it. Which way to go, but you've got to hit it harder than that. De Haer save. Corner to Arsenal, played in from the left, and it skips over the head of Van Persie. That just sums up his first 27 minutes. Actually, the first 27 minutes for Arsenal. It remains Manchester United 1-0. Young, who was booked for descent after the penalty was awarded by the right, runs down the left side, he wins the throw in. Hustlin Jenkinson into a mistake. Young takes the throw to Anderson. Anderson strapped for the end of Old Trafford, running towards the penalty area, but his attempted pass doesn't find his target, and here's the errant Van Persie. With Ramsey to his left. Rzitzki available, too. Ramsey ignores Rzitzki, tried to find Walko, who had broken forward too quickly and was offside, three-kick to Manchester United. Listen to the cheering for the goalkeeper. It would be a big lift for him. I just think Van Persie made it quite easy. Cleverly back to Evans, who was certainly guilty of falling at the Arsenal player, leading to the penalty. Walko, not really down the left side, really. Hedge of the penalty across us, takes an affliction, headed away, purely by Arsenal. Young collects it, yard outside the penalty. On the drive-thru, great shot, great goal! Wonderful strike by Ashley Young, Manchester United 2, Arsenal 0. Well, we had the perfect view of that, didn't we? When he just moved the ball out of his feet, as he cut him from the left, some kind of 10 yards alongside the 18-yard box, and he just curled beautifully. You knew as soon as he left his foot, it was less than in the back of the net. Manchester United's goal! What's your money on? 4 goals, 5 goals? I think Manchester City's total of 5 could easily be scored by Manchester United here. Well, as you said before, there's quite a few very poor performances. Take nothing away from Manchester United, but Arsenal are absolutely all over the place. Object. The right bat, he should be excused. He's young, very inexperienced, he's getting absolutely no help whatsoever from in front of him, Alan. He's got a lot of experience, but never from in front of him, Alan. I can't read Mike's writing, sorry. Premier League penalties this season? Seven missed out of 10. Seven missed out of 10. Unless it said 24 Anadan three times a day or something. Hahahaha! I think that was a prescriptive note from Michael. But definitely well meant. Here's Walcott for Arsenal. Arsenal could have been level at 1-1, one instead of two nil died. And we've only played 29 minutes. Jenkinson down the right side plays it off the shins of Evera. And it's out for an Arsenal throw in a couple of yards in the corner fly. In the Manchester United half Arsenal right. Jenkinson to take the throw in. We're bringing use of the goal at Hartz in a moment through Brand McLaughlin but we'll do it now since Arsenal wasted the throw at Brand McLaughlin. Why not Alan? Yes it's a goal for Hartz. Coming six minutes before half time. Ryan Stevenson the finishing of a terrific move that involved Jamie Hamill and Ian Black. There was Stevenson just six yards out to hammer the ball into the back and it Hartz deservedly in front. Hartz won. Hibs Nell. Thank you very much indeed. Well we could have a scenario tonight where two huge north London clubs you know have a point between them at the start of the season. Arsenal would be eight points behind Manchester United. Chaviches De Haer spills the save. Van Persie shoots again. It hits the Spanier goalkeeper and he's lucky to get away with it. Well they set the second one because they hit him a little bit but the first one he shilled it way out to the right hand side. And it just happened to be that Van Persie was there but he was really quick in terms of getting his position again. De Haer. So he's been quite busy actually. De Haer. Manchester United two. Arsenal Nell here on five live in the BBC. Coverage in the Barclays Premier League. Smalling to Cleverley. Good ball by Cleverley. Quickly played to Rooney. Nanny with a run forward. Rooney crosses deeper. Looking for Waelberk who heads it wide when he should have been on target. Yeah should have scored. Great ball. It was a royal of the Robes diving had it wasn't it? Bottom corner. Great ball by Rooney. Lovely ball as well played into him. He's hit it on the run early. Curling away from Chesney and Waelberk should actually have scored. Should be three now. Without question. So Hernandez is warming up. Would you be? Remember me. Look I know I think Waelberk's got great talent but he's not a patch on Hernandez for me. Not yet no. Should have scored there. Should have been his second goal after the first one was presented to him by Shambolic defending from Kishelny and Juru. Was it he lost the ball again? Well there's a surprise. Nanny in the far side of the field. Into Cleverine in the penalty. Pulls it back towards Rooney. Just knocked up into the air by Kishelny and is properly cleared by Ramsey. At least away from the immediate danger area and then Kokola hustling Anderson and Anderson fouls him. Freaking to after. Yeah I'm not sure who said it on a Wednesday night about pay for an over the cracks with Arsenal's result in Udine. I said it this afternoon. Somebody said it straight away on Wednesday night and it might have been Darren Fletcher. How right he was. I'm really surprised at how limp this display is from Arsenal. And of course Ramsey's just taking part in it now by over hitting a pass beyond Van Persie straight out of play for a throw and he put his head in his hands. Haven't seen a clue of Arsene Wenger for a while. We've lost to his head in his hands. Alan. Oh Shavin. And Persie. Razitzki. Where's the time? Juru. Juru. Object at best. It's nearly half your outfield players. Repeat though. They've nine players missing. Three of them suspended. All of them would have expected to start today. Stepping off so getting this team. Terry Neil might get in the team as he is now. He's only got one shoe. That's enough. Jenkinson with a throw in to Juru. Back to Jenkinson. And here's Kachelny. On to the far side and Treore. We're seeing Arsene Wenger now. Who's looking pained, let's say. Leaning back in these comfortable coaching seats at Old Trafford. Did he really say that the season starts on the tenth? Yes, he did. Home to Sunderland. It's not the shooting season, is it? Walcott on the far side of the field. As our engineer enjoyed that crack. 12 minutes to go to half time at five live. Manchester United two are still 0. It could be far more than that. And I fear for Arsenal that it will be far more than that. Well, the thing is, Mike made the point before. Look at the bench. Yeah. And look at Arsenal's bench. That's what I mean. I meant Arsenal's bench. Oh, Arsenal's bench. Tell us what you know about Ajuku or Sunoo. Yeah, all right. Answers on a postage stamp, please. Young, caught there by a shavon, but Manchester United had the ball. Advantage play, Evans plays it upfield. Well, back to the hamstring. Done a hamstring. With that question, chasing after that ball, Hernandez, limber up even more, you're coming on. Yeah, that is absolutely amazing. After what? Almost 35 minutes. How someone's hamstring goes, I'll never know. I've done it myself. Why, Mark? I don't know. I really don't. He's warm. He's been running. He's been sprinting. I have absolutely no idea. While he's going off-dark, and Hernandez will replace him with that question. Wayne Rooney getting fresh instruction. That's really tough for Welbert, having started the season so well. Yeah, it's a real tough blow. Goal today. Manjeet Arson will be delighted, Hernandez is coming on. Oh, yeah, that'll make it a lot easier, won't it? So, Chikarito, I think that's what the name is on his back. Is there a 606 tonight? Yes, sure there is. We need a physio, don't we, to explain to us why that happens with your hamstring. Well, in the absence of physio, I'm sure Robbie Savage will be able to explain. Hernandez comes on, and unfortunately Welbert's gone off, of course. Well, we're out, just getting to know for the producer. Arson are actually at home to Swansea on the 10th, not Sunderland. So, if a quote from Arson was accurate, he's completely lost the plot. Oh dear, Sunderland at home to Chelsea that day. Oh, I don't want to think about it. That's not fair. That's not fair. Still in the name of the opposition, but the quote was definitely Arsenal's season starts on the 10th. Well, the other problem is three days to go to the deadline. If they're on the end of a three or four here, who's going to come to them, play for them? Razitzki, Devan Persi, left of the United penalty area, back to Arshavin, Arshavin, pulls off Jones. Arshavin turns away again, back to Razitzki. Arshavin once more, 25 yards out, shot is high and very wide. And it's half down with Hartz from McLaughlin. Yeah, Hartz won, Haberni and Nill, Ryan Stevenson with his third goal of the season, giving Hartz a deserved lead, saying that Matt Thornhill missed a glorious opportunity to equalise for Ibs just before the break. Half time here at Tye Castle, Hartz won, Ibs Nell. Here we play nearly 37 minutes in the first half in the Barclays Premier League. Manchester United two, Arsenal Nill here on five line. Smalling to Jones, into cleverly. I haven't noticed any real alteration up front. I don't know what the instruction Rooney was receiving, but he's still roaming and always dangerous though he's lost the ball there to the youngster at Cockleland and then he wins it back, Rooney. Back it goes to Anderson, Rooney, Evera, the captain in the absence of Viddic and Evera moving in fear. Finding Nanny, Nanny is smalling, breaking forward on the right side and accurately, oh I thought he had played the pass accurately, but it was a little too strong and it's out ahead of smalling, out of play for Thoreau. Mind you, our shavin look bothered, like he was going to track him back. Oh yeah, not. You can count on that, not. Throw into Arsenal who trailed two Nill at all, Trafford and it could be worse. They've got another throw in, Midway inside their own half. Traore operating it left back, gives us one of the absentees and my goodness, they're missing Vermeelen, who's probably one of the very few players who's actually impressed in the opening weeks of the season for Arsenal. Jones to Rooney for Manchester United, a young who was clattered into by Jury and fouled twice by Jury as if the first time wasn't enough. You made the point quite rightly, Alan, about Arsenal missing so many players, 11, but if Manchester United had 11 players missing, they'd still have a formidable team. That's the point that everyone's trying to make to Arsenal Venger about the depth of squad and the quality of those players in the squad. He's stubborn. Can't think of any other explanation. He's stubborn. Free kick to Manchester United, nearly 30 yards from goal. Nani might have a pop. Rooney's a round. Anderson's a round. Nani clearly suggesting it's his. Seven minutes to half time. 2-0 to Manchester United. Hardwerbs got the wall back the full 10 yards. And Rooney comes forward, leaves it for Nani. Nani should try to put it in his dipping, but not quickly enough. And it's over the crossbar. Yeah, it was a little bit of a nothing, wasn't it? Is it with the in-step, trying to curl it? He's having a beat, she says. Still thinks he's Ronaldo. Goal at Watford for Steve May. Yes, it's an equaliser for Watford. Watford won, Birmingham City won. The scorer, Marvin Sodell, it's been coming, I can tell you. But a wonderful individual goal. He lashed it in from 20 yards into May's far left-hand corner. It's Watford won, Birmingham won. It's a blustery afternoon in Manchester. Quite chilly, threat of rain in the air. But nothing but delight from Manchester United fans so far in this usually titanic game against Arsenal. So far it's very straightforward. That looked like a foul and young. Now Jenkins has got a problem. He's going to be at least a yellow card. Young was approaching the penalty area. It's going to be a yellow and the ball was going away from the goal, surely. Well, you hope that Hardweb's only producing yellow and it is. Just a yellow card. I think that's the right decision. That's enough. Why they're arguing with the referee, Lord alone knows. What is their problem? Pull them down. And this free kick is in an area that surely Wayne Rooney will take charge here. And tell Nanny to back off. I just wonder it might be a little bit too near in terms of getting the ball up and over the wall and down in towards the goal. It's only a yard from the edge of the penalty area. Slightly to the left of the D. Aniston's across there. So too is Ashley Young and Nanny still in the vicinity. But Wayne Rooney sort of standing up, scouring the ball from others as if... Look, I've seen Anderson. I'm going to take this. See what Anderson's doing. Look. What is that in front of the goalkeeper? Oh, dear. So they can't see. Do you see it? Yeah, I do see it. Now, if the ball goes straight into the net, why is he not in an offside position? I wonder what being too fair in one end of the stupid rule. Anyway, the free kick is a vote to be taken by Manchester United. Four minutes to go to halftime. They're leading too near. Teed up for Rooney. Rooney shot! Into the net! Rooney scores again and it's an emphatic first half for Manchester United. Manchester United three, Arsenal nil. Great free kick. Great free kick. Just played into the man who just stopped the ball. Rooney just moves a yard to his right-hand side and just curls it into the top corner. Brilliant. Anything City can do, Manchester United will try to do. City won 5-1 at Tottenham. And you do fear worry for Arsenal the way things are going here at Old Trapper. Well, one of the reasons you'd worry not just the fact it's 3-0 is because four to five of them don't look as though they're bothered. I mean, I find that unbelievable. Well, United I think are probably looking better for the poverty of Arsenal's display. Yeah, but even so, you've still got to beat the team that you play against. Ramsey coming forward from the kickoff now. Ramsey plays it to Arshav and Arshav and into the penalty. The shot takes a couple of defection. Ramsey has an opportunity. Can't squeeze room for the shot and it should be cleared by Smalling and he's out of play. Goes for throwing. Ramsey was unlucky because he actually worked himself half yard and when he went from right to left about to clip it left foot toward goal, I think he started to slip. Throw in taken by Traorio in the far side of the field and then he, having taken the return pass tries to make progress. Foulters, Rooney the latest goal scorer back to Anderson. Anderson couldn't find Danny Koshelny to Jenkinson near side of the field and the young man comes forward and stabs it to Wolcott. Where's Wolcott been over the last 10 or 15 minutes? He's tackled there by Ashley Young. Well, he's not been thrown to Jenkinson. That's for certain. Paul Bregs-Rosinski, Jenkinson then crosses too deep. It's behind for a goal kick. I wonder what he says at halftime, Venger. I'd love to know. Apparently he doesn't speak for the first five minutes, does he? Did I think about it? Well, yeah, no. And that's some guy coming to you and maybe chasing the boots and the strip. And he says because he thinks 15 minutes is too long. Maybe 19 minutes is too long to have to play. You better know what he means. He said if I speak to him in the first five minutes, I have to tend to have forgotten what I said. Anderson streets the ball away towards the right side towards Nani, headed away by Traorio. Collected by Smalling, well done, Smalling. Finding Nani. Nani's crossing towards Hernandez, intercepted by Kishelny behind for a corner. Yeah, well done, Kishelny, this time, certainly. But again, it's Manchester United players in that final third, Alan. They just deliver all the time, don't they? If the ball's on, they just play it. Goodness, we're not even out of August yet, but it feels like the surrender of North London this weekend. Have you seen where Rooney is? What is really doing 30? You know why? He's only got 10 yards to walk to the... Completely unmarked. The corner came in and it's caught easily by Mr. Chesney. What's the period behind Rooney being out there? I think you thought ref might blow for half time and he was straight in, wasn't he? Into the dressing room. It was in for a pie and mushy peas. Or a visit to a little cubicle, I don't know. But I think we've got some time to be added on until we see how quickly Rooney makes to the dressing room. He's scored one of three Manchester United goals here so far in the first half. And they're not flattered by it. Actually, Young chips the ball behind Smalling and straight out of play it goes. You tend to say sorry. Well, you tend to forget about his goal, don't you? Great, wouldn't it? Excellent. Manchester United three Arsenal nil and we're about to be told by the fourth official how much extra pain Arsenal will have to endure before the five minutes of silence from Arsene Wenger. Jones heads the ball back. We've got three added minutes to the end of the first half. Just what you need. And of course, Dehaa also saved a penalty, remember, from Van Persing. That could have altered things. I don't think Arsenal are playing well enough to have deserved a 1-1 score line. But nevertheless, the lift that would have given them as it was Van Persing's soft spot kick was easily saved. Arsenal three kick. Kishelny to take it plays it to Juru. Juru onto Jenkinson near side of the field Arsenal right back to Kishelny. Kishelny takes it on his mid-drift and on to the far side and Treori. Treori now to Walcott on the left flank for a change. Walcott into Rositski onto Ramsey. Ramsey chips the ball forward. Oshavan heads it back to Walcott. Ockler from Walcott to take. But it's poofed in the air by Jones and then Young only beltered the ball back into his penalty area. Smalling headed it clear. Then Nani did enough to put off the Arsenal challenge and United still keep possession with Anderson. De Cleverie. Two minutes of added time still to go. Now Rooney spots the Chesney office line. Ships from long range. The Chesney gets back and saves. Yeah, good vision but Chesney knew James. He was always going to save it. You would hope for his sake or he would never live it down. Rositski over the halfway line left of the centre circle. Flicks it back to Oshavan onto Ramsey. Ramsey to Jenkinson. Jenkinson up to the edge of the penalty area and then his first touch was poor Evans plays it back to the hair and the hair's first-time clearance towards Rooney. He's been pushed in the back by Juru. Juru got away with it. Ball breaks to Ashley Young. Young feeds it through the middle towards Nani. Chesney out of his penalty area and he wax it up to the centre circle. Chesney down by Rositski to Kokolant. Kokolant to Rositski once more and then it's given away straight to Jones. Van Persie kind of touched the ball all that often in this first half. His most memorable touch was the penalty. The penalty which wasn't memorable at all. Anderson drills it forward. Rooney after it. Rooney is offside. Hard to spot there. A few stewards in yellow on that far side and I'm trying to spot the yellow flag of the assistant. Got it in the end and Arsenal got the free kick in the end. That would be the checkered flag though, wouldn't it? Whatever it is. You know what it is. Well, it's... Hold on a second. There's a checkered. It's white and red. Would it give you a chance? I think you'll find it's yellow and red. Yes, yellow and red. OK. And what more do you know about Sunoo? Me think there lies a problem here. I'm not too... A cup. A shavin'. Terrible cross. Only half cleared. A shavin' gets it back. Edge of the D. Ryzynski, end of the penalty. Walk up with a chance. Schitt's brought all the legs up to here. The hair felt again and Arsenal have a go back. Manchester United 3, Arsenal won. Yeah, well done, Walkup. Just passed through. Real sort of tight angle. He's hit it at the goalkeeper. He's gone down a bit like Bambi. His legs are all over the place and it's actually gone straight through his legs as well. 3-1. Well, it's as well he's got such a contribution further upfield from Manchester United because that was definitely a goal keeping him at stake. Just a strange way he was Alan, the way he set himself. Oh dear, oh dear. Just seeing the replay, which is even worse than the first sight. We've had our added time. Referee hardware blows his whistle and reflect, Mark, if you will, on a 3-1 scoreline which could have been 6-1, 6-2. Yeah, it could certainly have been 6-1. And I think, you know, quite a few of the performances of some of the Arsenal players have been very, very poor. At least four of them. Manchester United have been at the most rampant, they started high tempo. But in saying that, after the first goal, well-capitalised on a mistake by the two centre backs, you know, honestly, that Van Persche had a great chance to make it 1-1. And then the next thing is, Manchester United go down the other end of the score. Two sensational goals afterwards. Goals two and three from Jung and from Rooney. A reply by Wolcott, but I have to say that this scoreline could be anything in Manchester United's favour. As it is, it's Manchester United 3, Arsenal 1. And they'll have to win by five clear goals if they're to join Manchester City at the top of the table. Manchester City beating Spurs, 5-1 at White Heart Lane earlier today. Reaction to come from that and Newcastle's 2-1 win over Fulham. West Brom against Stoke is still going on, but the deadlock has been finally broken. Alistair Bruce Ball. We're into four minutes of added time. Stoke scored in the 90th minute of the game. There's a volley here from Malumba, which goes flashing wide. So it's West Brom nil, Stoke 1, which if West Brom lose, will mean three straight defeats at the start of the season. It is a goal that will have to be watched on match of the day 2 tonight. There is some controversy about it. A long ball came bouncing through to the edge of the West Bomb area. Gabrielle Tamas was trying to shepherd it back to Ben Foster. Ben Foster came out, put his hands up, and he claims he had the ball in both hands, and it was kicked out of them by Ryan Shotten, who came in with a challenge with his foot up. I don't think Foster ever had the ball under control, and I think the reason he is claiming that he did is basically to make up for an embarrassing mistake by himself. I don't think he had both hands on it. I think he could have been braver. It's West Brom nil, Stoke 1. It's been an awful game, I have to say. We've got two minutes of added time to be played, but I think Ben Foster, former Stoke keeper, by the way, that was where he started his career, was at fault for the goal. Ryan Shotten has scored West Brom nil, Stoke 1. Well, they are specialising in late goals, aren't they, Stoke? With equaliser at Norwich not so long ago, with Kenwin Jones scoring in the 94th minute. It was, last time we heard from Steve May at Vicarage Road, Watford 1, Birmingham 1, but there have been two goals, Steve. Yes, it's Watford 2, Birmingham City 2 now. It looks as if we're looking at Watford's first home point of the season. They've scored their first home goals of the season, so they'll be quite delighted about that. And in fact, Martin Taylor, big Martin Taylor, formerly, of course, of Birmingham City, has just equalised with a header after Mayhill failed to hold a shot. And that was just after Chris Wood had put Birmingham back in the lead. Terrible defending from Watford on the right-hand side. They left Wood completely out on his own, Wood cut in and placed it past Loach. That was a second goal for Birmingham, and then the equaliser, as I say, from Martin Taylor. We're still playing here. It's Watford 2, Birmingham City 2. In the Clydesdale Bank Premier League today, two goals from Gary Hooper in the first half, gave Celtic a 2-0 win at St. Mirren. Rangers hoping to go above them playing Aberdeen today. Ian Turner. We're into stoppage time at the end of the game. Rangers won Aberdeen 0, and Rangers will be going back to the top of the league. And it looks as if they will extend their unbeaten home record against Aberdeen to 37 games. Stephen Davis expertly put Rangers in front in 15 minutes. The only highlight of a terrible first half. Doing much better in the second, Aberdeen have pushed at every opportunity. Ricky Foster really should have made it 1-1 with a diving header after Alan McGregor had pushed out a Scott Vernon shot from 20 yards. But he only hit the bar with that, and over it went, and there went Aberdeen's chances, of at least, if not a victory, a famous draw. We've got about one minute of added time to go. It's Rangers won Aberdeen 0. How Hibbs could do with a bit of luck, or just a goal at heart today? Hibbs bottom of the table, Brian McLaughlin. Yeah, and they need a goal, certainly, to get back into this game. They trailed by one goal to now, we're just a minute now, into the second half. Ryan Stevenson scoring the only goal so far, just six minutes before half time, but it was a deserved half-time lead for the home side. Hibbs though, came out strong in the second half, and already had one shot and goal. Ivan Sprill from 25 yards, testing Marine Kello. But they just can't get through. Hearts won Hibbs now. Well, it sounded like Rangers were cruising to victory towards the end of their game against Aberdeen, but there's been another goal who's got it, Ian Turner. Yeah, Rangers have it, it's now 2-0 Rangers. It's Stephen Naismith with his fourth of the season. It was a free kick from 20 yards, fired in. A terrible fumble by Aberdeen goalkeeper David Gonzalez, and there was Naismith from two yards to prod at home, and it will now be Rangers three points. They lead Aberdeen 2-0. If you missed it earlier, all sorts of shenanigans at the World Athletics Championships, with Usain Bolt being disqualified for a full start in the 100 metres, and also Mo Farah getting silver for Great Britain in the 10,000 metres reaction to come from there. More on the world-rowing championships, and obviously reaction to the Formula One Grand Prix won by, who else, Sebastian Vettel. But before all that, let's get the latest news from Lucy Gray. Online at bbc.co.uk slash 5 Live. This is BBC Radio 5 Live. The Libyan opposition say they're urgently searching for nearly 50,000 prisoners captured by Colonel Gaddafi's forces before he went on the run. It's feared they've been locked in secret underground bunkers and have been abandoned by their captors. A man's been arrested on suspicion of attempting to murder two police officers during the riots in London. They were hit by a car while trying to stop looting. Another man was arrested and bailed earlier this month. 60 mile an hour winds have been battering New York, causing flooding in parts of Lower Manhattan. The whole of the city's transit system has been shut down. The cost of the damage caused by the storm across America's east coast is expected to reach billions of dollars. A man's died in a crash at a dragster race at York Raceway, the driver who's described as very experienced, lost control at the finish line and the car rolled over several times. And hundreds of extra police are on duty at the Notting Hill Carnival in London. They've been given extra stop and search powers because of the recent riots. In a quick look at the roads, there's been an accident on the M50 in Gloucestershire. One lady's closed on the westbound carriage between junction one at Tewkesbury and junction two at Leadbury. Traffic's easing on the M8 in Renfrewshire, broken down vehicle on the westbound carriage at junction 26 has been moved. An earlier accident has now been cleared on the M6 Northbound in Cumbria, that's at junction 37 in Kendall.

Should also say match of the day two tonight should be fantastic. So many goals from all the games today, particularly from Manchester. 10.30 with Colin Murray on BBC One. Alan Hansen is one of his guests. OK, full time at Vicarage Road. Steve May. Yes, Watford two, Birmingham City two. Very exciting finish for the Watford fans at the end of this match as Martin Taylor had a free header into Bowers-Mihalds' goal after Milad failed to deal with a 20 yard shot. Moments before that, Chris Wood had seemingly given Birmingham the win. This was after Marvin Sadell had levelled Adam Rooney's first half goal, probably in the end the right result for both sides. And certainly for Watford, it was their first home points of the season and their first goals at Vicarage Road this season. Watford two, Birmingham two. In the Clydesdale Bank Premier League, anything that Celtic can do, Rangers can do two, both went out of Europe and both won 2-0 today. Here's Ian Turner, what's Rangers Aberdeen? Yes, as you say, they have beaten Aberdeen by two goals 2-0. This was not a good Rangers performance, let me stress that. But it was good enough. Steven Davis gave them the lead on 14 minutes after being set up by Nikita Jalevich. Ricky Foster really should have equalised in the second half when Alan McGregor pammed a ball right into his path. His diving header, however, hit the bar and went over. And then right at the death, Steven Naismith was first to pounce on a mistake by the Aberdeen goalkeeper after a free kick. He tapped it in from close range. Rangers go to the top of the lead by beating Aberdeen 2-0. Now, earlier on this afternoon, the Barclays Premier League, Manchester City put in another really strong performance. Nasri went straight into the side. They're so much more threatening up front than last season. Today they won 5-1 at Tottenham to go to the top of the Premier League. Four of those goals came from Eddin Jekko, and he's been speaking to Jonathan Pierce. Could you dream about a start of the season like this? No, I have to say no, because it's something fantastic. You know, with the team to have after three games, nine points, and I scored six goals, and it's amazing. Have you had a goal scoring spell like this? I think I never scored six goals in, I don't know, maybe first 10 games, or maybe 15, and now it's six in only three games. What is the difference between you, the start of this season, and when you first came to English football last January? Yeah, when I came, everything was difficult for me, because I was the new in the best league in the world. And I said, OK, from the beginning it will be difficult, but then I didn't have a pre-season with the team, and now I feel much better, much stronger, and after pre-season, everything is different, and I know the league better, and the players against us, we play, everything is different. How easy is it to play when you have Nazary, Silva, Aguero? Yeah, of course. I think we played today like a team, fantastic game, and I think also that Nazary will be fantastic for us. Is it near perfection playing football like this? I think today was fantastic, but it's just the start of the season, and we have nine points. It's perfect, I can say, but it's a lot of games to the end of the season. Eddin Jekyll with Jonathan Pierce, Jekyll scoring four goals today. When Harry Redknapp became the Spurs manager, they were right at the bottom of the Premier League when he took over from Juan de Ramiz, and that's exactly where they are now, not a great start to the season, bottom of the league after losing their first two games of the season to both Manchester teams. It's been difficult, two obviously, two very good sides, but today, again, for 35 minutes until they scored, we had as many chances today. I mean, we were opening them up, and they were, it was an end to end game. It was a very open game, but it was always going to be an open game because of the way they set up today, and the way we played today. I ended up with two wingers, two midfield players who had not defensive minded, Rafa and behind the striker. Really, we almost played with six forwards because we haven't got any defensive minded midfield players or defensive players that I could even fill the team up with if I wanted to. So that's how we went about it. We were going to slug it out a little bit today, but unfortunately for us, they got the first goal, and they were a threat. I mean, they've got world-class players, forwards, there's no doubt about that. It's only a start, it's two games into the season, and when the end of the season comes, we'll be banged there again. I've got no doubts about that. You like the defensive midfield players today. Is there any movement to bring people into fill those holes? That the window is coming to the end? Oh, we're looking. We've got one or two options, you know, and we're hoping to do a couple of bits of business if we can. You know, we'll have to wait and see. The biggest problem for us has been that, I think there's been too much talk about our players leaving. I think it's been a really unsettling pre-season. It's probably the worst pre-season I've ever had since I've been in football. I've not enjoyed it one little bit. You know, it's Lucas staying as he goes, and every day non-stop. It's all we ever get talked about. We've really had, you know, he's the main player for us, and he's been linked every day, even this morning on drive, and then suddenly there's a £40 million off of coming in from Chelsea. You know, he's supposed to be playing today. I speak to him at Barse 11. He tells me whether he's right to play or not. It's not been the ideal preparation, you know, and then suddenly Crouch is supposed to be going to Stoke. Is he going? He's in my team. We're talking about him going today. I mean, it's been a difficult time. Is there any truth in those things, or will things progress in the next 24 hours? No idea. I don't know. Whoever Chelsea have made a £40 million off, I wouldn't have a clue. They wouldn't... They're dealing with the chairman with that, and the chairman stands all along. It's been... He's not going to sell him. So if he sells him now, he's going to leave, you know, he's going to leave us a little bit up the swanee, and it really would be about three days to go. If you're going to sell him, I'm sure he would have sold him two months ago. Well, they are up the swanee at the moment. Bottom of the league after losing five-one today at home to Manchester City, Edgian Zecker scoring four. Elsewhere, Newcastle won 2-1 against Fulhamuts and James is partly on bests, scored both Newcastle goals. West Brom lost a stoke by a goal to Nill at the Hawthorns. In the championship, West Ham won 4-1 at Nottingham Forest. Vicarage Road, Watford and Birmingham drew 2-2, and in the SPL, Rangers won 2-0 against Aberdeen. Celtic won 2-0 at St. Mirren in the Edinburgh Derby. Hearts lead bottom of the table, Hibs by a goal to Nill. And at half time, in the final Barquese Premier League match of the day, Manchester United lead Arsenal by three goals to one. What could happen in the second half? Let's rejoin our commentary team at Old Trafford. Mark Lawrensen, Alan Green and first, Mike Ingram. Welcome back, it was an eventful first half. The Manchester United revised lineup. Remember, Welbeck got a hamstring injury. He scored the first goal, he got a hamstring injury after 35 minutes and was replaced by Hernandez. So the Manchester United team is the hayering goal, Smalling, Jones, Evans and Evera, third in hands on the bench today. Then Nani Anderson, cleverly young, who scored a terrific second goal, United and then up front, Hernandez and Rooney, Rooney who got the third from a free kick. The Arsenal line-up in a moment, Manchester United playing from left to right in the second half. Good challenge coming in from Juru. What will that goal do for Arsenal just before half-time? Van Persie doesn't collect it and Evans knocks it out for throw in the other side. The Arsenal line-up, very unfamiliar line-up, Shezhenin goal, Jenkinson, Kishelny, Juru and Troyori, Kokolan who did okay really, the youngster in midfield, Ramsey, Rizitski, Walcott, Van Persie and Arshavim. What happened in the first half was that after Welbeck scored for Manchester United, Howard Webb gave a penalty against Manchester United at Old Trafford and Van Persie missed it. Oh rather, Dehaet saved it. So Arsenal failed to equalise, Young made it 2-0, Rooney 3-0 and then right on half-time as Juru seems to be holding onto it, it was the other way round. Reckless given the free kick to Arsenal. No, at first it was the right way. Rooney held Juru before Juru held Rooney. And then right on half-time, Walcott beat Dehaet very easily. It was a poor goal for the keeper to let in after saving a penalty earlier. Rizitski now into Ramsey in the area, awkward bounce for him and it just wouldn't come down for him and Cleverley now bringing the ball out and he gets away from Aaron Ramsey. Still Cleverley, Hernandez wants it near side and he finds him. The Mexican, Hernandez on the ball. Cleverley wants to return pass, goes from Nani to Hernandez. Should have gone through to Cleverley but Arsenal block, it's Cochaland there. Of course the news of Wielbeck's injury means that he's out of the England squad. I'm sure he would have been in it tonight for the matches against Bulgaria and Wales. Now it's André Archevin on a yellow card remember, looking to release Jenkinson, not a bad ball. Evera comes in with a great challenge and it's out of the penalty area and Evans is there now to try and complete the clearance. Evans into Young, Young's scooped ball into Rooney. Rooney against Juru, the ball drops to Young and now Rooney once more. The lines are open for 6-0-6 with Mark Chapman and Robbie Savage. That comes after the game, a benthful day, I'm sure Spurs fans in particular, after the 5-1 home defeat will want to speak to 6-0-6. Nani now for Manchester United, good run into the penalty area. Rooney just couldn't stretch but Arsenal fail to clear and Ashley Young has a chance. Young saved at the near post by the keeper, comes out again and Ashley Young was almost in for a second time and I'm not sure if I'd hit the post as well. It's come to this near side and it's an Arsenal throw in and they were all over the place there defensively. Oh my, the number of times when Manchester United had been in there and had space in which to decide what to do, Rooney, Young, all those kind of players has been amazing. Manchester United's 3 Arsenal 1, so at the moment it's Manchester 8, North London 2 today in the two games. Earlier Spurs won Manchester City 5 and now Evans for Manchester United and a feature for me of the first half is we saw nothing of Arsenal venga at all in the technical area. He's led it to Pat Rice today completely and Pat Rice is there again as Young goes forward and now Young's gone over, hobbled down and he of course is another player who can expect international duty next weekend. I think he's just been caught across the shin mate. I don't think it's a muscle injury. I think he's caught across the shin by Jenkinson. Right, free kick to Manchester United. Howard with the referee then. Manchester United 3 Arsenal 1, at least Arsenal have managed to avoid going through three games at the start. As a welcome world service I was just making the point that at least here today Krumm of comfort for Arsenal, at least they've avoided. It's not a free kick by the way, it's going to be a throw in over on the fast. At least they've avoided going three games at the start of the season without scoring. Had that happened today, it would have been the first time since the early 50s. Walcott's goal right on half time is Arsenal give the ball back to Manchester United because the game stopped so that Young could receive attention and now it's Jones. This highly promising centre back, full back as well, midfield if necessary. Manchester United and Nani and Smalling who had an excellent first off. Great return ball now for Nani. Troyor is out of position, Nani into the penalty area, Rooney's waiting and Nani goes for glory. Selfishly really, nooks the ball over the bar into the crowd and Rooney just gives him a look at the far post. I think it's a glare more than a look. The other thing is under pressure from Troyori, Nani could have gone down in the penalty area, that would have been a penalty and then secondly he had to pick Rooney out once he got into the position where he was. The angle was just so tight. Jenkinson, header down to Young Cockaland in midfield. Cockaland now lifts it towards Arshavin on the near side and Smalling just takes it away from Arshavin and Dehaire clears towards Nani and Nani can't control it and it's a throw to Arsenal just in front of Pat Rice down this near side. This is five live and BBC World Service, Manchester United three, Arsenal one, United went into a three-nil lead inside 41 minutes, Arsenal missing a penalty to Hairst saving from Van Persie and now Arsenal with a goal on half time and Wolcott was fouled by Evera. I mean the clearest foul it Howard Webb flattened him, absolutely flattened Theo Wolcott who hasn't moved since then. Webb is just standing over him and I think he's going to be okay. As there's a moment of a break here just for the World Service in particular just to sum it up what you've seen so far. Well men against boys is probably the best summation I could give it Manchester United by far and away and much better than Arsenal in every single department maybe apart from the goalkeeper had a number of chances in the first half, converted three of possibly six, replied from Arsenal after a missed penalty was from Wolcott very very late but it's I think this game's turned into a matter of how many can or how many do and how many do Manchester United want to score here? Ashwin, poor Arsenal they're playing from right to left and he loses the ball so easily to Nani and Nani almost got that through to Rooney. Nani will go in again though you think United were trailing three-one Rooney's on side early ball into Watson and there's Juru takes no chances and can seize the corner. Sorry mate it looked as though for me as though Rooney was just off anyway he's gone now but again and you've touched on it the easy way in which Arshavin just lost the ball yet again himself and Rositski have been disgraceful in that department. The hungar ear of the two sides here are leading by three goals to one. Manchester United want more goals corner kick to them, header behind by Jenkins and it's still in play and it's scraped away by Kishelny again unconvincing at the back from Arsenal Evans keeps it in and finds Cleverley the young midfield player. Cleverley cross the field to Evra. Evra as Manchester United move forward once more. Ashley Young the score of the second goal finds Rooney the score of the third goal they're all calling for it. Rooney's ball to Nani on the edge of the area challenge came in from Troyori and now it's Rositski of Arsenal three-one to Manchester United. Arshavin and now Ramsey just held up by Jones on the halfway line now Cochalin the young French player gives the ball away no Arsenal have still got it but they're not progressing now Ramsey wants more Ramsey feeds Rositski three-one to Manchester United Pat Rice claps his hands down there in the technical area and Walcott takes over but there isn't great ambition here from Arsenal Troyori van Persie's in the area Rositski back to Walcott is playing on the left hand side at the moment square ball to Rositski van Persie's calling and it goes towards van Persie saved by De Haer at the near postal was no offside and van Persie could have scored yeah he could have scored and he hit it first time it's a very good save by De Haer but he could have actually had another touch mark and then put it from his right foot to his left I think that would have been three two. Arsenal fans still trying to get behind their team here three-one down they're still giving plenty of support away in the right corner there three-one though to Manchester United and now Rositski getting away at Ashubin getting away from Ebra Andrej Arvishan. Ashubin runs a long way with the ball United defend it van Persie chases across to the far side he's got two United players who's never going to get through there Ebra bringing the ball out now for Manchester Anderson bringing the ball out and cleverly now just got a bit sloppy Manchester United three-one to Manchester United as Kishelny steps in and cleverly's in the way still Arsenal they must score the next goal if they have any chance of getting back into the game as the move breaks down danger for Arsenal here as they push forward getting caught on the counter by people like Nani who's on the ball at the moment might feelings come out to try and urge his side to concentrate three-one they lead cleverly for Manchester United young available down the left hand side and it goes now short to Hernandez good noise around old Trafford at the moment as the balls played down the line to Hernandez over on the left hand side Hernandez up against Cockalan Ashley Young now takes over dribbling skills from him goes past Jenkinson fuzzled in with too much pace Rooney won't get that it's a throw in near side for Arsenal yeah a great ball you know you had to fire it in with pace because he got round the back of everybody and defendants starting to catch him up Rooney just couldn't quite get there nearly 10 minutes gone in the second half I'll remind you of the other scores a rare appearance right sorry yeah of arson venger on the train for the first time in the game and we played nearly 10 minutes of the second half he's down there alongside Pat Rice now having sat really and watched almost a resign look on his face in the first half and now Jenkinson for Arsenal into Aaron Ramsey is that the character in the arsenal side to get back is that the leadership from van Persie loses the ball to Smalling and with great long strides Smalling brings the ball and nobody comes towards him and Smalling's run a long way with it and he fired it straight at Theo Walcott and he'll have to get back inside his own half now as very crisply Ramsey sends Arshavin on his way Arshavin inside Jones still it Arshavin Arshavin shoots wide it's a corner though for Arsenal yeah and I think Jones he's just saying too small and you know you went forward which is fine and you gave the ball away somebody has to fill in for you and he's absolutely totally right which should have been nanny in that particular instance Arshavin should have done better earlier today Newcastle 2 full on 1 Spurs 1 Manchester City 5 with 4 from Jeco West from it Javier Niel Stoke City 1 those are all Premier League results today it's a corner to Arsenal it's taken short by Arshavin to Rizitzky Rizitzky in and a good catch from De Haer nobody to give it to at the moment he's cleared it down field there's only Hernandez downfielders offside in the championship nodding the forest one West Ham 4 West Ham brilliant on the road Watford 2 Birmingham City 2 in Scotland Celtic 1 2-0 awaited St Mirren Rangers beat Aberdeen 2-0 and Hartz are leading 1-0 with not a lot of time to go against Hibbs in fact I think there's another goal there here's Brian McLaughlin yeah maybe through the second half it's no Hartz 2 to Aberdeen Niel in Blacks corner in from the right hand side headed down by Webster cleared off the line but only to Egert Jonsson who 8 yards out and he hammered the ball home Hartz 2 Hibbs Niel Alex Oxlade Chamberlain is coming on in a moment for Arsenal Youngster of course they signed from Southampton so he's coming into the game in a moment on the 15 just getting fun that's why some Venga came out just to talk to him really so Oxlade Chamberlain is coming on soon for Arsenal they trail here by three goals to one the ball is with Van Persie there's nobody in the penalty area Van Persie's got it and he just plays it square into Cochalan and Cochalan was caught in possession by Hernandez but Cleverley has to give it back to his goalkeeper and De Haer's high clearance to the halfway line should be headed back by Juru he's decided to control it and then finds Ramsey Manchester United 3 Arsenal 1 that was the half-time score here it's Andrei Arshavin tried a little reverse pass towards Walcott and now smalling to bring the ball out for Manchester United gives it to Jones Arshen Venga jumps up and down John Cleese Stahl again down there not happy he's speaking to Andrei Arshavin at the moment Oxlade Chamberlain about to come on Manchester United building down the left hand side Young cuts in against Jenkins and Jenkins does well on this occasion though and the Manchester United players have to regroup in midfield Anderson holds it and finds Cleverley back again to Anderson all the Arsenal players apart from Walcott now back inside their own half as Evans floats one to this near side smalling controls it well just down this near side in front of us smalling on the edge of the lovely ball into Nani smalling has gone for the return Nani going wide down the right and still Nani Nani can't get the shot in delayed it Rooney frustrated once more Paul Clarets by Arsenal though as Anderson finds Cleverley Cleverley looking for a one two for the Nandes should have scored it's it's straight in the goalkeeper Mike he did the really hard thing which was getting himself in the penalty area two yards of space and just and just passed the ball really to the goalkeeper just he says no more than anything just about another touch well all the goals so far in this game from English players that should have been another one from Cleverley as now Arshavin shoots weekly the goals have come in from Wellbeck Ashley Young Wayne Rooney and Theo Walcott four English players scoring in this Premier League game it's Arsenal clearing by three goals to one the ball refusing to go out of play here so that Oxlade Chamberlain can come on and it's back again with the hair in United's goal in the yellow away to our left Jones back again to the hair 14 minutes gone in the second half you're listening to five live BBC World Service and Austin Venger suddenly now has become more animated down there as he looks to get Oxlade Chamberlain into the game it's interesting to see who he takes off he's had a little bit more from Arshavin in the second half mind you he needed to the ball is with Cleverley darts forward for Manchester United and finds Hernandez Hernandez gets away from his markers Jones into Anderson back again to Jones and now for Hernandez once more in a deep position early ball to the far side of the field neatly brought down by Evera Young goes on the outside Evera coming forward for Manchester United another goal and it really will be all over Hernandez linking up with Young and now Anderson comes in finds Rooney Rooney to Nani lots of passes is there anything here at the end of it as Nani now takes on triory Nani's ball in away by Juru and the clearance complete by Ramsey but Jones meets it with a firm header Arsenal can't get out of their own half Evera's there once more tracking back on the half wayline and Evans finds Jones great piece of skill by Nani the way tricked to triory wasn't it Jones coming forward and then overrunning it as triory clears very weakly to Smalling Smalling and Jones whenever they can love to come out of their own half Nani now a run from Hernandez diverts a couple of Arsenal players Rooney now oh great ball from Rooney to release Hernandez early ball will find Young Hernandez though decides to chip and hangs it high and easy for the goalkeeper Nani did the exact same thing in the exact same position when Rooney again on this occasion pulled away to the far post completely on March Anderson for Manchester United leading by three goals to one and they've grown again in the last few minutes Manchester United Anderson again in the move Anderson on to Ashley Young Young shot saved by the keeper comes back to Young Nani should have got it in he was inside the six yard area and didn't get anything on the ball at all Arsenal still haven't cleared it's Wayne Rooney of Manchester United three one they lead into Hernandez on the edge of the area squirted forward by Hernandez and an offside is given Hernandez even then can't put the ball in the back of the net and it's a free kick to Arsenal now they can make the change yeah I think in the end first saved by Shezny but when the ball came to Nani it's almost though he stood on it didn't he was it was a Zoe's reaction surprised that the ball came to him it's a fantastic position to score well they've let them off the hook a bit in the second half Manchester United and it looks it cock a land I think coming yeah it is yeah so cock a land comes off and Alex Oxley Chamberlain makes his way where to the far side I think maybe this means Walcott down the centre does it know at the moment Walcott's going to play on the left so perhaps Arshivan's going to go in behind van Persing yeah so Oxley Chamberlain on down that right far side three one to Manchester United all the goals in the first half and now it's Cleverley the hard-working midfielder into Rooney lovely return Cleverley now onto Hernandez back comes the defender and Koshelny did really well there had to get that right otherwise it would have been a penalty if he'd brought that uh ascending off if he brought him down he was the last defender uh Arsenal lose their way completely and the ball now is collected by Dehaer so Walcott's in the position now where he scored of course for them in midweek in Italy against Duneze on the left hand side scored in the last three games hasn't he yeah and a throw out by Dehaer who had a very mixed first half saved a penalty let one in easily right at the end of the first half from Walcott Nani now Nani great ball to Rooney let's it run on to Hernandez and then as Rooney went for the return he was caught by Zuru and it's a free kick to Manchester United and a yellow car for Zuru yeah I'm not sure whether the referee actually saw that I think he reacted to the crowd as much as anything and he's and he's given a yellow in fairness to Howard Webb Zuru's not made a moan about it whatsoever he definitely had his hand on his back Zuru on Rooney's back well Rooney's already scored with one free kick this one is to the right as we look at it it's three yards maybe outside the penalty area Nani and Ashley Young in conversation with Rooney Duheshne in the Arsenal goal away to our right United score now and it really is game over Manchester United three Arsenal one on five live and well service 18 and a half minutes gone in the second half and deep in conversation and thought Rooney Young and now they're trying to distract the Arsenal defenders by wanting them back another yard or so it's touch to Rooney and Rooney scores for the second time from a free kick Rooney to Young and then a little carler from Wayne Rooney finds the back of the net for the second time in this game and wraps it up here at Old Trafford Manchester United four Arsenal one Mike I'm not sure because you're concentrating on the take of the free kick which was Rooney whether you saw the goalkeeper he gambled he thought once the ball came back to Rooney he was going to stick it in the top right and corner as we look and Rooney just very cleverly just dinked it over the other side and I won't say it trickled him but it just went in really really easily the goalkeeper completely hoodwinked well he's in very good nick at the moment isn't he Rooney very good nick which is good news with Fabio Capella and England a way to Bulgaria on Friday night you'll hear that on five live Manchester United four Arsenal one and to be honest there could have been many more goals as well for Manchester United here today if the final ball had been a little more convincing at times so four one they lead and it's all up now for Arsenal four one to Manchester United five one to Manchester City against Spurs north London one and truly drugged today by the city of Manchester nine two at the moment on aggregate and it's not all over here yet great noise around Old Trafford 20 minutes gone in the second half and the thing was Mark even before Rooney made it absolutely sure there weren't really convincing signs that Arsenal were going to turn this around no they'd had a little bit of the ball and our shaving our shaving had a chance but apart from that they saved from Dehaire from Van Persie which was good but no United look like it could score at any time and our arson vengour has sat down now as the corner kick is taken for his team and it's a good jump and header away by Chris Smalling Rosicki very half-hearted from him in the first half and now it's Van Persie down the right hand side looking for a one two we're going to have changes here now Park is coming on in a moment for Manchester United it's a sort of game this United Arsenal that normally Park would start but of course he's coming back from injury he got the only goal in the Premier League game here between these two sides before Christmas last season and now what a great ball from Ashley Young from left to right to Smalling and Jones is galloping on the outside of Smalling Smalling gets a little bit tangled up but now he finds Wayne Rooney Jones calls for it he goes to Nani he should be 5-1 and Nani just slots it distinctly over the line to make it 5-1 to Manchester United it was 5-1 to Manchester City against Spurs here it's 5-1 to Manchester United against the other half of North London Arsenal and Nani's goal is celebrated by All-In-Sundry here and it's a thumping home win I tell you what Mike I've watched that goal on match of the day two tonight started by Manchester United's corner flag and they just played the ball out and a great change of play ball from Young and in the end the ball threw to Nani I think it came from Rooney and he just dinked it over she says and he just committed himself absolutely brilliant well now they're going to really take the foot off the gas here Manchester United by making two changes and bringing on two players who started the Champions League final Ryan Giggs and Park that was Nani's last kick of the ball in this game he's been replaced by Giggs Anderson's going off as well we are at the halfway point at this and the other thing Mark just before we go to Alan in the build-up to that game we had both Jones and Smalling as well breaking out of defence in his options to attack so who's to say that's the end of the scoring yet still a corner of the game to go it's Manchester United 5 Arsenal 1 and here's Alan Green and I feel quite sorry for Sir Chesney who's made some outstanding saves for Arsenal and hasn't had a prayer with any of the goals that have gone past him I think Mike's right the scoring isn't finished Manchester United 5 Arsenal 1 listen to 5 live at the BBC covers in the Barclays Premier League and too many of those Arsenal players out there aren't cutting it Rositski or Chavin van Persie and I have to say too Wolcott not done a lot here's Rositski to Ramsey Ramsey onto Jenkinson on the far side Jenkinson into Oxlade Chamberlain Jenkinson once more and now Ramsey still at 22 minutes left for player remember here at Old Trafford van Persie to Wolcott left side for Arsenal level to the edge of the United Penalty here just dink the ball in carelessly hoping to find van Persie find a red shirt instead and here's Wayne Rooney who scored two sumptuous free kicks plays at Fulton Hernandez who's on side good anticipation by Sir Chesney well out of his penalty area to make the clearance gigs from Manchester United and to Rooney gigs again back to Jones Alan there are too many Arsenal players when they lose a ball he wants it not bothered here's Park right side Park just checks inside Traore finds Rooney 25 yards out tries to chip to Chesney hit the post goalkeeper beating so close to a hat trick we've been absolutely brilliant on it brilliant I think the overwhelming supporters inside Old Trafford are enjoying this apart from the Arsenal bunch unfortunately we made a great racket early in the second half not that they expected a comeback from their team but just trying to show their support here's Jones from Manchester United 20 minutes left for play here on to Park steps away from Juru finds young in the penalty area Hernandez waits back at go to Park on his left foot six one come back for the record books how easy was that how easy absolutely no pressure on any Manchester United player on the ball and you know what I say the Arsenal players are walking down so very very despondent Alan there's probably only four or five of them we've had a real go today they've come here they've been missing 11 players but they've also come here with half a team if they've been disgraced for one or two of them I mean van Persie is going around talking to the various players at the moment but if he had a hand mirror he could look at it as to his own display but United have been really good as well they've been rampant but uh and the quality of the goals as well as the exit but talk about contribute to your own downfall sixth one how many more are shavin to Ramsey in the centre circle and Ramsey moves forward the Vades Park plays it back to Rezitzky van Persie with movement up front ball goes towards shavin back to Rezitzky in the van Persie edge of the penalty tries to back heel it to Walcott didn't come off and it's cleared by Evra Jankensen to Oxley Chamberlain on the far side of the field back to Jenkins Jankensen into our shavin a yard outside the penalty now Ramsey's shot takes an affliction off of defender behind for a corner yeah Ramsey's one of the few Arsenal players actually kept going one of the very few and to Chesney yeah yeah I know I know a conceding six goal but actually played quite well mom he did he has corner the strat for then to Arsenal swung in left but he and Kishelny's header is wide relatively free header Jones jumped too early yeah sure actually at least hit the target Kishelny not good not good from an Arsenal perspective and he's got what many now one two three days of the transfer window and well you're not exactly inexplicable yeah if he doesn't make some substantial purchases Benger and not exactly looking at attractive outfit to come and play for at the moment no no one point awaiting you Castle having lost your two best players and some Arsenal fans at the moment just cannot bear to look and I do feel sorry for them balls in towards Ashley Young at Jenkins and got across and Jenkins and puts it out of play for Cohen you know this is the team a club rather that neutrals across the country love to watch playing Arsenal but they're in a terrible state at the moment they qualify for the Champions League group face would you bet on them surviving it cleverly being hustled by Ramsey but keeps the ball for United for the champions and then Jones takes it forward Ramsey intercepts it out for the throwing Rooney's been magnificent absolutely magnificent he takes the throw in depart back to Rooney Rooney anticipated the run from gigs that didn't materialize and it should be cleared by Arsenal our shower hustled by small the Russian runs away from him though the first time he's run all day and that's a glorious ball to the right side that's what our shower is capable of Jenkins and up from fullback crosses deep towards van Persie headed up and away by Jones Jenkins and headed back in there here's van Persie it's a goal for Arsenal Manchester United six Arsenal two you know when Jones made the original clearing head here Alan it was a decent header all the Manchester United defenders actually stopped and in the end it was a good ball through to the far post bounced lovely for van Persie left foot roof of the net and no don't tell me I've got 30 seconds for a match report it's only eight goals so far I'm good at 33 25 are being told by the producer right okay we still got 16 minutes to go north London fights back don't you believe it gigs on to park that was a lovely ball for the weltsman park perhaps reacted a little slowly Kishelny intercepted and now it's Rzitzky Rzitzky sprinting forward van Persie running through the middle the pass goes backwards though towards Ramsey Ramsey checks a few outside the penalty here under hits the pass to walk up smalling intercepts smalling gives it away not good from smalling now Rzitzky for Arsenal again to Ramsey Ramsey to van Persie just outside the United Penals area stopped or Shabani's inside the box now or Shabani then falls over far too easily it's gone behind for a goalkeeper yeah I think it's actually clear me not a foul he thought maybe a Manchester United player had the last touch but I watched when smalling just pinched the ball after the Arsenal attack there were five Arsenal players just started walking back towards their own goal Manchester United six Arsenal two has been really quiet afternoon in the Barkley Premier League Tottenham losing five one at home to Manchester City Newcastle beating Fulham 2-1 West Bromnell Stoke 1 and here's Walcott shooting from long range straight at the goalkeeper the hair who doesn't crumble he saved a penalty as well no made a better save you know from van Persie start to the second half there's a really good save low to his left the hairs clearance upfield Hernandez after it so Chesney out to the edge of his penalty that throws the ball out to Juru and now it's with Rzitzky again we're inside the final quarter of an hour here on five live coverage of the Barkley Premier League and here's another note Arsenal's worst ever defeat in the league was 8-0 to Loughborough in 1896 whatever happened to Loughborough Mark no I have the clue either Rooney into Hernandez he's onside can't bring another control first time no he falls over his inner penalty it is you know he's outside the box the assistant is where what the referee given uh-oh oh it's not a red card it's a oh dear poor Jankensen second yellow for him no red he's off and it's a free kick to Manchester United I was just to add insult to injury isn't it I thought as well when the ball was initially played that Hernandez might have been just offside obviously not given there's also Mengus shaking his head that was my initial instinct as well and then you know he wouldn't he wouldn't he never had control of the ball I know he does but Jankensen's put his arm across him and hit him and he's gone over as he which it's a foul so it's 6-2 for the champions against the 10 men of Arsenal who've got to go through another 13 minutes of torture here at Old Trafford and the free kick is only a foot outside the D of the penalty area what's our sharpen complaining about no he's looking at Rudy's already scored from two free kicks remember he's probably said don't give it to Rudy he's scored enough already yeah well will it be a hat trick of free kick goals for Wayne Rudy neither of the previous ones was a direct shot at goal it came from a tap and a tap back and that looks as if it's what's going to happen again so Rooney standing closest to the ball young is there I know very fools everybody shoots first time wide yeah should have had the tap you know I think it was it I think it was quite a bit wide wasn't it yes it was good advice jesney well relief for Arsenal I feel sorry for Jankensen now I feel yeah absolutely not good enough only joking I feel sorry for Jankensen really do here's van Persie the Arsenal captain van Persie onto Rezitzky van Persie runs through the middle pass goes to our Chavin who limply concedes possession and here's Evra onto Ashley Young on the far side of the field united left Rooney available down that flank as well but the pass goes back first of all to Johnny Evans who's that crossfield ball to Jones is chested down the past is smalling on it goes towards Park Park can't pick a possession and Kishelny for Arsenal busy little game hasn't it been only eight goals at least eight other goal chances well there's been umpteen that's an attempted pass by Ramsey to Oxlade Chamberlain didn't reach the target cleverly for united to to smalling are the champions going to take pettianese off we're going to look for extra goals you think with the um rival between these two clubs particularly in the years of the the Premier League they'll go for more I think they want to bury them united want to bury them young into Rooney great run by gigs Rooney finds gigs Park's unmarked into the Korean slips over didn't control the ball properly in the first place slipped over inside the day and Arsenal clear it in a strange way it was as almost as though he didn't expect the ball wasn't it then Rosinski gives the ball back to Manchester United back to Evans we still go over 10 minutes to go down Fletcher has been watching the game from the director's box makes his way out I'm sure he'll be hoping to get back into this team pretty shortly but he might have a struggle you know if you a park and gigs are going to be left on the bench as a matter of course Rooney certainly will be in the starting lineup cleverly to gigs in the centre circle now cleverly again gigs once more Rooney always available gigs to park Rooney again fourth time he's been involved in this move onto ever in the far side of the field the United fans taunting Arsenal into Everett in the penalty falls over a penalty oh dear you just knew didn't you you just knew Trolley was it they're not they're not even arguing Arsenal that is amazing well I'm afraid you know Wolcott's challenge it is Wolcott Trolley's involved as well but I tell it was soft from Avram but here's a penalty opportunity for Rooney Cecesney's complaining a 6-2 to Manchester United poised for 7-2 poised for Rooney Hatchek well this is now bordering on humiliation now ideally he needs the penalty kicks would have tapped to him if it was legal I'll have free kicks Perez-Honory however Cecesney arms aloft stretched out wide now and he's glaring trying to catch Rooney's eye trying to put him off hard work talking to the England striker but this will be the third goal for Rooney if he converts the penalty here he goes doesn't make Cecesney went to the right Rooney shot went to his left and it's Manchester United's 7 Arsenal 2 and it was just such a poor challenge in your own penalty area by Theo Wolcott I mean it was it was just such a limp challenge it just summed up Arsenal from four o'clock this afternoon I'm running out of scrap paper to write the notes on can I please have 35 seconds 30 seconds oh that's all that's enough that's enough that's almost you know four seconds ago I mean it well for Arsenal but they've been very very poor you know architects have their own defeat that and a blistering display from Manchester United juror it's full time at Hart's Bramichlockland I guess I'll let's finish hearts to Hipsnil goes from Ryan Stevenson and Nega Jonson ensuring this is the home fans who've been partying tonight in the festival city Hipsnil rooted at the bottom of the table with pressure mounting and boss Colin Coddwood at Tyncastle it finished hearts to Hipsnil I'm not sure it's finished here yet at Old Trafford Manchester United leading by seven goals to two and you know only midweek delight for Arsenal and getting past Udinezy getting into the Champions League group phase awful oh I'm told now can I have 35 seconds if I mention the penalty same this is taking the Mickey well Arsenal I've had the Mickey taken out of them today and it's hard to find any positives they're going to bring on two substitutes now Shamak how low has he sunk if he's only being brought on as a striker with seven minutes to go and land landsbreak two final changes van Persie is being replaced and so too is Walcott Walcott remembers to applaud the Arsenal fans some of which have already made their way out of Old Trafford so van Persie's day is over so too is the Walcott's and do you recover or how long does it take to recover from a defeat like this well you know the R11 players I know it's just three points yeah and the R11 players out so it depends on how quickly you can get the majority of those players back you know we keep saying they needed players before they even sold Nazary and Fabrikas so the question needs posing how much responsibility does Arsene Vengerhaven have for that he has a lot he has to have a lot of responsibility Alan and Graham Taylor I don't know if you've heard Graham but Graham said about the the soft muscle injuries that are suffered by Arsenal players yeah well too many of them I think the ground's got a lot to do with that though smally to gigs gigs right at the center circle to runny who's got his hat trick remember now back to cleverly gigs gigs flicked forward offside flag against Ashley Young yeah he was he was on is there any saving grace for Arsenal um no I can't I can't even think of one and I think Ramsey played yeah and the goalkeeper the goalkeeper and cockle over for his substitution and Sagesney faultless for the seven goals that have gone past him faultless the fact there's more reason to criticize the hair than there is Sagesney yeah Ramsey onto Chammak Chammak lost the ball far too easily was giving it back and lost it again he looked good when he first came in to the Premier League it's not just losing the ball Alan it's then not breaking into at least a jog he's that he's sort of trotting around the center circle and Bismol actually young from Manchester United on the far side of the field into Rudy yard outside the penalty here his cross wasn't great headed away and uh now Arsenal can counterattack if that's the right phrase uh for a situation facing them trailing by seven goals to do here at Manchester United or Chavin onto Ramsey Ramsey with Lansbury do his right cuts in onto his left foot second time under his left foot and should score was just right oh it was as well and a hair was flat footed he's almost sort of towed it right at the end for uh because he didn't change his feet it was in the middle of his feet and he thought i'll just toe bung it want to have a better description it was very close well it's been a stunning weekend in the Premier League i mean i know there's some there have been some boring games but Liverpool were very good yesterday Manchester City were exceptional at White Hartley and earlier today and now we've had this Manchester United display so what happens it's an international break also the number of goals that have been scored today i think match of the day two maybe limited contractually to showing 10 minutes of a game oh yeah there's no no there is a limit so yeah no there is yeah that'll be fun getting nine goals of a penalty you won't you won't want to be in the edit suite as we speak by the way cleverly uh back to Evra and we've got three minutes to go plus added time i'm not even sure that they can ask for more time Alan gigs rushing through and the ball just evades him goes through to Sir Chesney no they're just oh that's given away by Troy Orrey awful park forward edge of the penalty park back now to Ashley Young into Hernandez who slipped on the edge of the penalty area just as well for him last week she cleared but he was offside anyway Hernandez and it's a free kick to Arsenal yeah well think they'd probably look to extend the program but i'm not quite sure whether it would be allowed no that's it's good job for the editor rather him than me and then of course you've only got the six goals at Tom they are you're the you're the editor of match of the day which which match starts which match starts well i personally i would start with Spurs yeah against Manchester City that's and then go on that's about chest united i would guess that's what i would guess but i'm i'm not the editor of the program and they'll probably kick off with west brom stoke oh no they won't they won't oh shabbat it's a miracle he's still on the pitch actually he's been so abysmal lost the ball on the far side of the field then Rzitzki father united player in an attempt to get the ball back yeah it was a crude challenge on Ashley Young who felt it free kicks already been taken by Manchester United and now it's with Rooney Rooney short of the halfway line glides a glorious ball to smalling down the right Hernandez spending into the penalty there's the cross anyone to beck again he missed it and somehow suggest he got a hand to it well fantastic ball from Rooney overlapped and run from small then early return of the ball from Rooney into the path of an Anders who missed it could have been eight great cross from smalling and and Rooney again mcnivison ramsey over the halfway line running through the centre circle then spots a colleague down the far side and flicks it towards Oxlake Chamberlain early ball into the penalty air one bounce straight through to the hair reminding you that of course Jenkinson was sent off for a second yellow card one minute of the regular 90s still to go and with all the changes you've got to have at least three or four minutes of added time however painful it is for Arsenal Rooney a hat trick for him to gigs Rooney again Rooney then finds cleverly cleverly turn and is cleverly once more and now to Ashley Young Rooney just hanging back at the moment cleverly once more the United appear happy just to keep possession now and not to pile further agony on their north London opponents Evans chips it forward ever is offside yeah whatever's playing he's playing a striker at the moment he wants a goal doesn't he 75,413 I think that was what they said yeah you'd uh you'd pity those poor Arsenal supporters going down the m6 because that'll be down to 15 miles an hour but they've had a great day I pity them just getting out of old Chafford the the taunting that they will face here comes the fourth official um about to tell us how much extra time three that's really the minimum Oxlade Chamberlain backs it away towards the far side of the field good control low cross in towards our Chavin who slices his shot well wide of goal yeah I think he got stuck whether to actually control it or play and shoot at the same time and probably really didn't either the number of these players you wonder what they're still doing at Arsenal I mean our Chavin is has looked off off the ball for a very long period yeah but he had to play him they've got no one else no one else ever we're into out of time now Manchester United seven Arsenal two now you're not miss hearing things at five lives that is really the score line uh Rooney forward to Giggs Giggs sprinting down the left side Hernandez waits for the cross but it's pulled back to Ashley Young his shot eight two brilliant finish from Ashley Young and that just ends it ends it for Arsenal Manchester United eight Arsenal two I think Alan that was a replica of the goal he scored in the first half cutting in from the left one touch out of his feet bending it round to sesad into the far top corner brilliant a roof over arson venga watching on can I have 40 seconds please is there only chance of 40 seconds for the mic before and the producer just ignoring my field he's going off can I have 40 seconds yes he says at a minute and a half about a time remaining I wonder if the city players are on a bus coming back up to Manchester listening to this probably good I'm fine how good were we today yeah how good were we you're out here well United had been very very good but Arsenal have also been very very poor and look at shamak what has he done since he's come on no effort at all Kishelny get the ball away to Oxlade Chamberlain the former Southampton player with a mad rush into the United Territory and then he runs out of possession Evra on to Ashley Young he's not on a hat trick and we'll fancy it there's still time to get it on to Evra Hernandez front into the penalty area Evra pulls it back here's Park shoots over the crossbar he never fancied in video at all when the ball came back to him he's almost when he gets in those positions something happens to Park he never has that sort of cool head just to finish and just blazed it over the top how easy again did Manchester United get behind Arsenal hard web night having a private conversation with Wayne Rooney I don't think hard web's going to extend this unnecessarily the conversation will be Wayne will say don't forget the ball is mine well the ball is now with Wayne Rooney as the referee's whistle blew but I think it's for a free kick for a foul by Swalink on shamak or Chavin taps the free kick to Riziski hard web says give me the ball he gives it to Wayne Rooney and it's been a humiliating day for Arsenal and for Arsene Wenger yeah it's been an embarrassing day for Arsenal yes we know they were sure and have all sorts of players come here to play at Old Trafford but they never and for a minute actually physically competed in Manchester United if you've got players who don't normally play the very least is you have an effort you lose the ball which happens you get back behind the ball you make yourself difficult to beat I have to say apart from three or four Arsenal players today the rest have been an absolute disgrace not fit to wear that shirt I'm afraid I just think how much worse it would have been if they'd lost in Italy in midweek and the goalkeeper hadn't played so well well done to Manchester United some of the goals were absolutely breathtaking they've won this game far too easily I couldn't have imagined driving to Old Trafford earlier around lunchtime but I'd be giving this final scoreline Manchester United eight Arsenal two stay there boys because I want to reflect and digest what we've seen today 19 goals in four Barclays Premier League games here today's results Manchester United eight Arsenal two if it came up on the video printer it would actually be in brackets wouldn't it EIGHT Tottenham one Manchester City five Newcastle two Fullham one and West Brom nil Stoke one in the championship Nolingham Forest one West Ham four and Watford two Birmingham two goals galore there in the SPL all the games finished two nil St Mirren nil Celtic two Rangers two Aberdeen nil Hartz two Hibernian nil um look at this Manchester City nine points out of nine goal difference plus nine goals scored 12 so that's an average of four a game you'd think they'd be top it would have been absolutely identical but for that last goal man United nine points out of nine goal difference plus 10 goals scored 13 mark Lawrence and yes I don't know where to start really start start with how bad also okay first thing fine Manchester United played really really well Ian but but I really honestly you know triory van Persie or Chavin, Rizitzky, Juru I thought they were very very poor today and you know the very least from any professional football is you have to work hard everybody can be excused from not playing particularly well giving the ball away failing to miss chances giving chances to the opposition but really when you lose the ball and you you're not even got the inclination to run back and make a challenge I think it says a lot about you as a person and also the way the team is is arson venger's job in danger no no I don't think it is because don't put is he's got 11 players out today but the next three days are so so important because he's going to have to try and turn this round they just they need players in we've always known that they've that they needed players they've known for ages that they've needed players and if they don't get them in by Wednesday then he puts himself under even more pressure as a manager with all that money available why wouldn't you go out and buy players but he as you say he's got a money available we know he's got a little bit of money from last year we know he's made money from the two big sales you know one of the big shareholders or almost big shareholders mr uzvanov we understand is richer than mr abramovich well it's spend well it's yeah well yeah but you know we said before as well Manchester United have won eight two here today against arson they signed in the summer after being 12 points clear of arson winning the Premiership last year three players three top quality players arsonal have actually if you if you if you work it out is the sign javino who's obviously ready to play oxlade chamberlain isn't ready yet so that's one player signed and two the best players have left so that they're straight away the four players behind manches united who finished 12 points in front of them at the end of last season so where's the psyche behind that if you're arson man i just don't understand it what do you think about the fact that Manchester City have put down a marker today united have responded like that are we looking at a two-horse race or is it far too early no no it's far far far too early chart chelsea haven't started well in terms of performances but they've got seven points from three games no you can't discount chelsea and liverpool have also made a decent start i think what we do know is that arson will be nowhere near i'll be trying to win the league in terms of by the time we come to early may next year no no very good starts by manches united and manches the city i think i think what we've learned we don't learn anything new from manches united they're still the favorites but manches the city if they keep aguero silver nazi tevez if you want jecko all those kind of players fit in i think they're going to run manches united very very close indeed yeah well arson have got one point from all their games so far in the premier league and they are lying in 16th place i think i might actually might be 17th place now because fulham has probably gone above them after that absolute drubbing manches the city and manches united there just to repeat alongside each other united ahead by dint of the fact that they have got a gold difference of plus 10 and manches the city have got a gold difference of plus nine but they have been scoring an amazing amount of goals today in fact goals galore today and we haven't even spoken about new castles two against fulham they won by two goals to one and west brome nil stoke one um are arson looking like finishing outside the top four for you well at the moment with what they have and the way they've gone about the business or not absolutely absolutely are and there's most definitely i mean you know that top number will have two or three and by wednesday won't they i thought there's any doubt about that whatsoever so that they will get stronger libra pool obviously looking stronger we spoke about united spoke about manches the city and chelsea to a certain degree at the moment on what we've seen after what three games each you might argue that arson are going to do well to finish six uh i can confirm that arson are 17th which means they are one place above the bottom three and that's only because the bottom three haven't scored any points at all yet top num no points blackburn no points and west brome no points at all thank you very much to mart lawrenson to our other commentators today allen green and to my kingdom so just to confirm today's score lines if you can believe it you're just joining us at old trafford it finished manchester united eight rooney got a hat trick arsenal two and they had jenkinson sent off
