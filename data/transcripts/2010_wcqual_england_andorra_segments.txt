[0.00 - 4.96] P:2100.85 E:0.072750 |  Well good evening from Apuga to Wembley Stadium. We've just seen half a dozen
[4.96 - 9.00] P:2074.55 E:0.075193 |  young men with a banner, a yellow banner which said we had to walk to Wembley.
[9.00 - 12.48] P:2162.81 E:0.070726 |  Well they've got here, we've kicked off just over 10 minutes away. Let's talk
[12.48 - 19.16] P:2232.96 E:0.071207 |  about David Beckham for a bit. Mark, he's 34, he was 34 last month so he'll be 35
[19.16 - 24.08] P:2156.19 E:0.066886 |  next year if he can get to the World Cup. Could he play age 35 in Central
[24.08 - 27.88] P:2120.48 E:0.075220 |  Midfield? I noticed that Fabio Capallo said he played for me at Real Madrid in
[27.88 - 33.52] P:2103.01 E:0.063917 |  Central Midfield twice. Well that was not a mod of a re-endorsement is it? No, I
[33.52 - 38.00] P:1917.06 E:0.056935 |  don't think he can play there in all honesty. I think it's a case of needs
[38.00 - 41.96] P:1837.88 E:0.077244 |  muster. I think we see what will happen with Beckham presuming that he
[41.96 - 46.00] P:1978.76 E:0.069867 |  goes to the World Cup market. He will come on as a substitute. I can't put a
[46.00 - 49.68] P:1992.26 E:0.073890 |  life in me think that he will start any games and if he does it either means in
[49.68 - 53.80] P:1999.86 E:0.075234 |  the first group in the first two matches and decide to give him a game in
[53.84 - 59.40] P:2011.38 E:0.072739 |  the third. But no, I think he will be used as an impact substitute or lack of
[59.40 - 62.96] P:2029.21 E:0.075256 |  impact substitute, whatever you want to call it. Who should be playing there
[62.96 - 66.12] P:2139.26 E:0.082923 |  instead this evening Graham? Were there to be somebody else? Who should play in
[66.12 - 70.72] P:2014.04 E:0.075946 |  Central Midfield tonight? I think when you look it's the availability of people
[70.72 - 74.52] P:2024.25 E:0.077914 |  and what you don't want to do, I don't think at this stage, is to bring someone
[74.52 - 78.56] P:2006.42 E:0.076896 |  in because Carrick's missing, because Barry's missing, that you're never going
[78.56 - 82.04] P:2014.11 E:0.077146 |  to use that person again. Do you know what I mean? And that's why I can see some
[82.28 - 85.76] P:2057.07 E:0.070116 |  sense in what he's saying. Look, I've got the squad of players. I think it's
[85.76 - 91.80] P:2059.54 E:0.075869 |  pretty well near what he sees as his main squad. We moved Gerard about, so
[91.80 - 97.12] P:2057.17 E:0.064686 |  Beckham I think is impressed with Beckham's not only fitness, but what he
[97.12 - 100.16] P:1900.40 E:0.069421 |  did at Real Madrid when he buckled down and got back. And I think that
[100.16 - 104.12] P:2003.53 E:0.065664 |  impresses people like Capello and great credit to David Beckham. So I don't
[104.12 - 108.04] P:2080.11 E:0.074649 |  think it's a question of just bringing somebody else in. I just feel that if
[108.04 - 112.32] P:2059.04 E:0.065138 |  you're going to play him in Central Midfield, this is the game to play in.
[112.32 - 118.20] P:2055.41 E:0.063506 |  And it gives him a game. Mark, I have to tell you, against Andorra, they speak
[118.20 - 123.16] P:1941.93 E:0.070891 |  from the House of Commons could play in Central Midfield. Even if he's on his way
[123.16 - 131.84] P:2127.94 E:0.062696 |  out. Let's go and make a play. Alan, get on, Mike. What about Gerard
[131.84 - 135.88] P:2060.16 E:0.057172 |  Central Midfield and playing right Phillips out wide? Well, that's what I
[135.92 - 141.16] P:1848.71 E:0.061892 |  was saying earlier, Mark. Personally, I would rather have... I know he doesn't
[141.16 - 146.36] P:2021.05 E:0.065988 |  want to experiment until qualification is absolutely guaranteed. And that's
[146.36 - 149.96] P:1984.06 E:0.069886 |  fine. It's highly professional, the attitude. And you can't argue with the
[149.96 - 154.84] P:2087.61 E:0.059884 |  record that Capello has brought as England coach. It's exceptional. But
[154.84 - 161.16] P:2081.34 E:0.061308 |  tonight, this is a pub team that kicks. Andorra will not win the game.
[161.44 - 165.48] P:1958.59 E:0.071500 |  I think it will win the game. Ideally, it will be seven or eight. Probably, it
[165.48 - 169.88] P:2044.13 E:0.069307 |  will be two or three. But I would rather have taken an opportunity to see
[169.88 - 173.24] P:2095.66 E:0.070453 |  Ashley Young or James Milner, rather than David Beckham in the seven in
[173.24 - 178.36] P:2036.77 E:0.076492 |  midfield. I know who Mike was talking to me earlier about what Capello said
[178.36 - 182.04] P:2033.80 E:0.076857 |  about Gerard's role in the England team. And that's fine. It's what I sort of
[182.04 - 185.48] P:1994.99 E:0.072013 |  half-anticipated. It's actually a compliment to Gerard that he wants
[185.48 - 189.16] P:1980.58 E:0.064924 |  Gerard in a forward role. But tonight, I would have played him alongside
[189.88 - 195.00] P:1952.52 E:0.067265 |  and seen either Milner or Young. I think the only thing England have to
[195.00 - 198.12] P:1999.71 E:0.066757 |  guard against tonight is the fact that all these players go on the holidays
[198.12 - 203.64] P:2095.18 E:0.071609 |  in the morning. So sometimes, as Graham will say, if they've got that in their
[203.64 - 207.80] P:2042.46 E:0.073367 |  head and wanted to decide to stroll around, it might make it a little bit
[207.80 - 211.00] P:2017.19 E:0.069297 |  more difficult. Don't get me wrong, I think England will win. But it might just
[211.00 - 214.04] P:2037.79 E:0.070632 |  make it a little bit more difficult than we think it's going to be.
[214.04 - 217.24] P:2284.48 E:0.080362 |  Do you think, will the players be slightly concerned about the physical
[217.24 - 220.36] P:2133.43 E:0.074909 |  aspect of this game bearing the mind what we saw in Barcelona?
[220.36 - 224.44] P:2124.59 E:0.074792 |  Morgay, yeah, definitely. The other thing is, you know, I mean, you can play against
[224.44 - 229.00] P:1966.48 E:0.068941 |  good teams that can kick absolutely fine. But when bad teams kick, it's even
[229.00 - 233.16] P:1915.43 E:0.069464 |  worse because it's very, very blatant and it's very, very difficult to stop. But
[233.16 - 236.92] P:1819.24 E:0.070867 |  if the referee's not particularly firm in this game, it might be a real problem
[236.92 - 239.72] P:1936.41 E:0.058558 |  for England. And of course, the last thing is, that's why I made the point
[239.72 - 243.32] P:1954.14 E:0.062230 |  before about the players going on the holidays tomorrow. If the flag starts
[243.32 - 246.68] P:1927.15 E:0.066181 |  flying, you might get one or two of the players in can hold on a minute. I don't
[246.68 - 249.64] P:1826.68 E:0.072075 |  want to get an injury. I don't want to have to stay behind in this country when
[249.64 - 252.76] P:1824.72 E:0.065632 |  I should be on the holidays. And the last thing I'm thinking about at the moment
[252.76 - 256.36] P:1957.49 E:0.079956 |  is pre-season football. I'm thinking about being on a beat somewhere, wherever you
[256.36 - 260.92] P:1906.93 E:0.065575 |  want to go. I think officially, the dirtiest team in World Cup qualifiers,
[260.92 - 265.16] P:1973.98 E:0.066402 |  this time around, Andorra, they picked up more yellow cards than any other nation.
[265.16 - 269.64] P:2034.86 E:0.071023 |  I mean, I just don't know what the point is of Andorra. You know, I'm all for
[269.64 - 275.24] P:2049.43 E:0.068820 |  Minos and the romantic notion behind Minos. But Andorra are deeply unattractive.
[275.32 - 279.48] P:2080.34 E:0.064565 |  It's a beautiful little country, but as a football team, they're awful.
[279.48 - 282.52] P:2252.72 E:0.081435 |  Well, they were very physical. When I said in Barcelona, in case you got confused,
[282.52 - 286.60] P:2146.99 E:0.070339 |  that's where Andorra played England in the first game of this World Cup qualifying
[286.60 - 290.76] P:2210.41 E:0.075487 |  campaign. We've just seen on our monitor, Graham Taylor, what about 100 tubes
[290.76 - 297.00] P:2257.39 E:0.071158 |  parked up empty, which is why over on the far side, there are sways of empty
[297.00 - 300.76] P:2232.67 E:0.073758 |  red seats, which you don't see very often at all. The players are down in the
[300.76 - 304.52] P:2200.18 E:0.075829 |  tunnel. Would you, as the England manager tonight, be worried about players getting
[304.52 - 308.60] P:2098.65 E:0.071265 |  kicked as simple as that? I can see where Mark is coming from, but I think this
[308.60 - 315.40] P:2108.20 E:0.064285 |  manager in charge of the England team will expect a performance and a result in
[315.40 - 319.16] P:2011.79 E:0.076020 |  this particular game. And if he doesn't get it, I think he'll be upset. And that
[319.16 - 323.64] P:2151.77 E:0.069114 |  might be worse than getting a kick. Was he pretty upset? I got the feeling from
[323.64 - 326.76] P:2192.48 E:0.078695 |  missing to you obviously in Almaty when I was at Epsom, that he was pretty
[326.76 - 329.48] P:2235.53 E:0.078764 |  out, even though England were two up, he was pretty upset at half time, wasn't he?
[329.48 - 333.56] P:2032.85 E:0.079767 |  Well, I mean, I think, and he had every right to be, and you know, he was off
[334.36 - 337.64] P:2078.92 E:0.073352 |  into that technical area, the front of the technical area, in that first five or
[337.64 - 341.08] P:2183.53 E:0.077741 |  ten minutes, you know, and you could see him really expressing himself, whether
[341.08 - 345.24] P:2092.42 E:0.077618 |  they could understand. I think his English is still a little bit better than he
[345.24 - 349.72] P:2163.79 E:0.074794 |  lets us know. So he was expressing himself in some very strong terms there.
[349.72 - 355.16] P:2228.83 E:0.076665 |  Is complacency the danger here? End of the season, pub team, England six out of six,
[355.16 - 359.40] P:2184.83 E:0.073474 |  long season, picky about holidays. Graham and then Tomar, is this a danger
[359.40 - 363.72] P:2196.38 E:0.079116 |  complacency? Well, it always is. It adds up and says it is, but I'll tell you what
[363.72 - 367.96] P:2142.19 E:0.076662 |  it shouldn't be. If you're, call yourself a professional, get the job done, the
[367.96 - 372.60] P:2192.77 E:0.078979 |  season's over, boys, go on holiday. But before you go on holiday, win this game
[372.60 - 375.72] P:2146.06 E:0.084007 |  and get it done. Well, the teams are coming out, and this is a very rare
[375.72 - 378.92] P:2183.73 E:0.075640 |  sight, because it's actually quite a surreal atmosphere with the ground,
[378.92 - 384.04] P:2167.14 E:0.067454 |  well, we've got a sort of overhanging stand above our head, so we can't see how
[384.12 - 387.40] P:2206.55 E:0.073840 |  full it is above us. But certainly, I would have thought no more than about half
[387.40 - 390.76] P:2272.13 E:0.073628 |  full at the moment. Mark, do you worry about complacency, or are we beyond that
[390.76 - 395.16] P:2065.60 E:0.066843 |  with footballers? No, I mean to that complacency angle as well, most definitely,
[395.16 - 398.76] P:1968.24 E:0.073298 |  because it's always a day when you're complacent in football that you get
[398.76 - 403.00] P:1956.25 E:0.060526 |  injured, Mark, and that was the point I was trying to make before. So, Graham's
[403.00 - 406.76] P:1970.18 E:0.069843 |  absolutely right, of course, get the job done. You just might have one or two
[406.76 - 410.76] P:2060.83 E:0.063595 |  of the players who just switch off a little bit. Well, the subs this evening,
[410.76 - 414.68] P:2120.96 E:0.073448 |  Paul Robinson, Gary Neville, Wayne Bridge, Ashley Young, Sean Wright,
[414.68 - 420.60] P:2163.56 E:0.063871 |  Phillips, Jermaine Defoe, and Carlton Cole. Just to tell you a result from Kiev,
[420.60 - 424.12] P:2137.08 E:0.070285 |  where England still have to go to, of course, Ukraine 2, Kazakhstan 1,
[424.12 - 428.76] P:2049.46 E:0.068469 |  which doesn't really impact upon England tremendously, but Ukraine have beaten
[428.76 - 433.32] P:2218.58 E:0.065531 |  Kazakhstan by two goals to one. Hollander in action this evening, interestingly,
[433.32 - 436.12] P:2175.55 E:0.070188 |  against Norway. We'll keep you in touch with that, of course, because the Dutch
[436.12 - 439.40] P:2101.89 E:0.072036 |  have won their group already, but of course, they would have an impact if they
[439.40 - 444.28] P:2096.62 E:0.070386 |  were to beat the Norwegians on the Scots and their attempt, of course, to become
[444.28 - 448.28] P:2061.45 E:0.065997 |  runners-up. I was going to say, an important night for Robert Green, but
[448.28 - 451.16] P:2121.82 E:0.067157 |  actually, I think you probably tell me that I could play in gold this evening,
[451.16 - 454.12] P:2039.59 E:0.078750 |  and I wouldn't have to do a great deal. So, actually, probably from Robert Green's
[454.12 - 457.08] P:2120.07 E:0.073181 |  point of view, it's a bit frustrating. You might like a real match to get his teeth
[457.08 - 461.00] P:1968.71 E:0.066913 |  into. Yeah, but quite honestly, Mark, I think it is an important game, because I
[461.00 - 466.44] P:2011.14 E:0.073886 |  think any goalkeeper will tell you, when you don't have much to do, you must keep
[466.52 - 471.00] P:2037.91 E:0.068486 |  your concentration, because that's when you might just lose it. And I don't care
[471.00 - 474.84] P:2030.81 E:0.078309 |  what anybody says, you know, yes, making the save, people say this, he's not going
[474.84 - 479.16] P:2017.32 E:0.071708 |  to have too much to do, but he must keep his concentration all of the time. So,
[479.16 - 482.92] P:2143.49 E:0.070019 |  it is an important game for him. Well, the two teams are just being introduced to
[482.92 - 487.08] P:2134.31 E:0.075855 |  the dignitaries here at Wembley, and of course, that goalkeeping position, well,
[487.08 - 490.04] P:2078.21 E:0.074707 |  we've got a year to go, and an awful lot can happen in a year, of course, in terms
[490.04 - 495.24] P:2104.42 E:0.070581 |  of form, in terms of fitness, so who knows, as everybody here, those who have made it
[495.24 - 497.88] P:2002.40 E:0.048507 |  to Wembley stand for the national anthem.
[615.64 - 621.32] P:2124.94 E:0.083078 |  Well, there we go, then, we've had the national anthems and kickoff, it's just a
[621.32 - 625.08] P:2165.12 E:0.081743 |  couple of moments away. Just time to tell you, I was mentioning Scotland's group
[625.08 - 629.32] P:2111.79 E:0.080675 |  there, group nine, that Macedonia have moved level with Scotland in second spot
[629.32 - 633.72] P:2119.79 E:0.076798 |  after being Iceland 2-0 in Scotland this evening, it means the Macedonians are
[633.72 - 637.40] P:2139.98 E:0.074504 |  now on seven points, along with Scotland, who do enjoy a slightly better goal
[637.40 - 642.84] P:2074.22 E:0.064023 |  difference, and have a game in hand of September's match in Scotland. So, there
[642.92 - 645.72] P:2145.90 E:0.071222 |  we are, you're caught between this evening, we've got former England manager
[645.72 - 649.80] P:2140.29 E:0.069481 |  Graham Taylor with us, Mark Lawrence and Alan Green, and first of all, here's our
[649.80 - 652.92] P:2081.18 E:0.047116 |  Chief Football Correspondent, Mike Ingram.
[652.92 - 656.28] P:2000.08 E:0.079480 |  Thanks, Mark, good evening. I think I read somewhere today that the last time there
[656.28 - 661.40] P:1890.40 E:0.070585 |  was a tube strike, the attendance at the Old Wembley was 15,000. Well, there must
[661.40 - 665.16] P:1983.82 E:0.075423 |  be three times as many here this evening, and really well done to everybody who has
[665.16 - 669.08] P:1893.12 E:0.063223 |  made such a big effort to be here, probably around about 40-45,000 at the
[669.08 - 674.20] P:1842.10 E:0.062014 |  moment here at Wembley on a cool evening. And England have shown today that
[674.20 - 677.64] P:2044.82 E:0.060991 |  England have made three changes from the side which played in Kazakhstan. Gareth
[677.64 - 681.24] P:1901.92 E:0.076484 |  Barry was suspended, remember, having got his second yellow card. David Beckham
[681.24 - 684.92] P:2025.41 E:0.065136 |  starting his first competitive match since the World Cup quarterfinal against
[684.92 - 689.80] P:1910.71 E:0.070847 |  Portugal, 112 caps for him now. Peter Crouch replaces Heskey, and Lescott takes
[689.80 - 693.40] P:1909.20 E:0.072393 |  over from Upson, and neither Heskey nor Upson are on the bench this evening.
[693.40 - 696.92] P:1964.92 E:0.073632 |  The England line-up is Green, his first England international at Wembley, the
[696.92 - 700.76] P:1810.97 E:0.072632 |  back four, and it's the same back four that played against Andorra in Barcelona.
[700.76 - 705.64] P:1845.89 E:0.066668 |  Johnson, Lescott, Terry and Ashley Cole, then David Beckham, Lampard, Gerard,
[705.64 - 709.80] P:1897.85 E:0.072838 |  Wolcott, Crouch and Rooney. Andorra have also made three changes from the weekend.
[709.80 - 713.24] P:1844.40 E:0.074602 |  They lost to Belarus at the weekend. Their line-up is Kolder, who's playing for the
[713.24 - 718.84] P:1857.20 E:0.070584 |  last time in goal for them tonight, 78 caps. Ayala, the two Lima brothers, Tony Lima
[718.84 - 723.16] P:1804.24 E:0.073619 |  and Ildefonse Lima. Tony Lima's also bowing out of the international football scene
[723.16 - 728.52] P:1729.64 E:0.068908 |  tonight. Sonoghi, the captain, Zyke Jema, the left back, then Marino, Andorra,
[728.52 - 733.16] P:1696.75 E:0.066162 |  they have a player called Andorra playing for Andorra. Vieira, Jimenez and the
[733.16 - 736.84] P:1733.04 E:0.069460 |  lone striker Fernando Silva. The referee is from Holland,
[736.84 - 743.48] P:1831.65 E:0.065094 |  Hendrikus Nijus, and Pavia Coppalo has lost only two matches so far as England
[743.48 - 749.16] P:1732.88 E:0.059037 |  manager. Both friendlies await a France and Spain, and there is a country
[749.24 - 753.72] P:1717.81 E:0.075727 |  sandwiched in between those two nations. And they're here tonight, but Andorra,
[753.72 - 757.56] P:1740.64 E:0.068892 |  not so much a mountaintop, more a molehill in international football, but Mark
[757.56 - 760.68] P:1594.78 E:0.068756 |  Lawrence and 190th in the world, they still have to be beaten.
[760.68 - 764.12] P:1729.48 E:0.062868 |  Yeah, they have to be beaten, like just about setting off in the right way,
[764.12 - 768.04] P:1709.87 E:0.065402 |  starting at a very, very high tempo, England, then you can always drop down a gear.
[768.04 - 773.16] P:1697.94 E:0.061843 |  To do it the other way around is more difficult. England are playing all in white this evening.
[773.16 - 777.00] P:1694.44 E:0.069785 |  Andorra, predominantly in red, England will play from right to left in the second,
[777.08 - 780.76] P:1801.69 E:0.072306 |  in this first half. Peter Kraut, you've got a couple of goals. The last time England played
[780.76 - 785.16] P:1822.06 E:0.071941 |  Andorra in this country, the old Trafford, stands alongside Dwarfing, in fact, Wayne Rooney,
[785.16 - 788.84] P:1823.96 E:0.076316 |  who's had such a magnificent season of goal scoring in international football.
[788.84 - 792.20] P:1808.55 E:0.074740 |  And away we go, and Pavia Coppalo saying yesterday that really,
[792.20 - 795.64] P:1821.58 E:0.073654 |  bearing in mind, he expects all the Andorran players to get behind the ball,
[795.64 - 800.28] P:1810.93 E:0.074565 |  England do really need to strike an early goal here. They were frustrated in the two away
[800.28 - 804.52] P:1805.25 E:0.057440 |  matches against Andorra, both of them goalless in the first half, and England
[804.52 - 808.84] P:1873.63 E:0.068541 |  immediately getting possession, and it's with Frank Lampard, just inside the Andorra half.
[809.40 - 814.68] P:1691.47 E:0.055399 |  Lampard plays it along the halfway line to John Terry, and now Glenn Johnson.
[814.68 - 818.76] P:1815.97 E:0.068522 |  One of the England players on a yellow card, by the way, in danger of missing the Croatia match.
[818.76 - 822.12] P:1861.83 E:0.071313 |  Should he get another one tonight? David Beckins in the same situation.
[822.84 - 828.04] P:1769.19 E:0.061352 |  Lescott onto Steven Gerrard. Gerrard playing quite deep at the moment. No Andorran players
[828.04 - 833.32] P:1720.22 E:0.064393 |  had a touch yet. Ashley Cole drifts the ball in towards Kraut in the first Andorran to have a
[834.20 - 837.32] P:1739.27 E:0.069587 |  touch of the ball as the goalkeeper called straight into his arms. I think straight away,
[837.32 - 841.80] P:1660.12 E:0.065932 |  a rune is pushed up alongside Kraut, and we've got Walcott pushed down the right,
[841.80 - 846.52] P:1745.70 E:0.059440 |  and Gerrard on the left hand side. So there's almost a front floor for England. Lovely flick
[846.52 - 850.68] P:1815.11 E:0.073426 |  from Kraut to send Gerrard going. Here comes Steven Gerrard for England, attacking the Andorra
[850.68 - 855.48] P:1803.95 E:0.067582 |  penalty area. Oh, good challenge though, coming in at the back for Andorra by Sonagy. Then as
[855.48 - 861.32] P:1783.89 E:0.064322 |  Ashley Cole tries to take possession, he's fouled Marino, and Andorra have a free kick. Well,
[861.32 - 865.88] P:1757.95 E:0.075029 |  just for the moment then, it's Gerrard playing on the left. He was more effective in Kazakhstan
[865.88 - 870.92] P:1648.29 E:0.074104 |  when he got on the ball and went into the centre. But just at the moment, England are playing a
[870.92 - 875.64] P:1667.70 E:0.065409 |  pretty authentic 4-4-2 with Walcott on the right, Beckins and Lampard in the centre,
[875.64 - 878.60] P:1615.45 E:0.043976 |  and Gerrard on the left. Yeah, it was an excellent tackle, wasn't it?
[880.84 - 887.24] P:1717.43 E:0.066850 |  Free kick eventually taken by Caldo into the England half. Lescott against Silva. Silva gets a
[887.24 - 892.68] P:1683.43 E:0.065761 |  touch, but John Terry's waiting to pick up the pieces and sends Walcott now for the first time
[892.68 - 897.24] P:1639.22 E:0.066556 |  down the right-hand side. Fabio Capello is saying how important Walcott could be tonight to try and
[897.24 - 903.88] P:1678.94 E:0.073048 |  stretch the Andorra defence. Now Lampard with a beautiful ball, some 30 yards to this near side.
[903.88 - 907.72] P:1693.70 E:0.074439 |  Controlled by Ashley Cole, who takes a tumble. Gerrard plays the ball into Rudi. Lovely tip
[907.72 - 912.20] P:1708.43 E:0.079253 |  from Rudi. Rudi shoots, and the goalkeeper's just turned it over, and it's a corner kick to England
[912.20 - 915.96] P:1592.69 E:0.070273 |  over on the far side of the right. Good football from England. Well, as the ball was played into
[915.96 - 920.92] P:1690.46 E:0.075672 |  in a little bit of pace, Mike, he just shifted the ball and himself away to the left-hand side.
[920.92 - 925.80] P:1751.62 E:0.067319 |  It's all the goalkeeper out and tried to chink him. The first David Beckham corner of the evening,
[926.44 - 931.24] P:1744.25 E:0.069753 |  over on the right-hand side. Lampard's lurking on the edge of the penalty area. Lescott's gone
[931.24 - 936.92] P:1700.81 E:0.068235 |  forward. Terry as well, but it's headed away at the near post by Vieira for Andorra, only as far as
[936.92 - 941.08] P:1690.88 E:0.060761 |  Walcott of England. Walcott now to Beckham over on that right-hand side of the field. Beckham's
[941.08 - 945.08] P:1868.58 E:0.070231 |  been given a central role this evening. It's Glenn Johnson of England trying to get the ball
[945.08 - 949.24] P:1853.30 E:0.073719 |  into the penalty area. The ball breaks to Walcott. Walcott shoots, and the ball is hit. The ball
[949.24 - 955.88] P:1689.41 E:0.069489 |  is here scored. Rudi from no more than a yard out somehow contrives to head the ball against
[955.88 - 959.88] P:1734.92 E:0.069928 |  the crossbar when he should have scored for the seventh time in this group. But also the
[959.88 - 964.20] P:1760.08 E:0.069914 |  keeper's made a great save from Walcott. Walcott was very, very close in. I think your finger
[964.20 - 969.64] P:1639.39 E:0.066661 |  tipped it onto the bar, and it came back off the bar very, very quickly into Rudi. There's an injury
[969.64 - 974.84] P:1660.70 E:0.066006 |  to an Andorra player in the penalty area. It's not serious. Bang on the head. Ball is out of play
[974.84 - 980.60] P:1654.87 E:0.062998 |  down this near side, and Stephen Gerrard preparing to take a throw. While there are goals there tonight
[980.60 - 986.44] P:1880.22 E:0.065580 |  for Crouch and Rooney, certainly throw into England, nil-nil against Andorra, just underway here at
[986.44 - 992.44] P:1728.30 E:0.056418 |  Wembley inside the first four minutes. Throw in taken. Stephen Gerrard for England finding Lampard.
[992.44 - 996.76] P:1851.68 E:0.070402 |  Lampard now hits it across the field for Johnson. It's all England as you would expect.
[996.76 - 1002.36] P:1918.35 E:0.070906 |  Johnson's high ball into the area. Rudi will score for England with a header. Ball played in from
[1002.36 - 1007.56] P:1790.85 E:0.071746 |  Glenn Johnson. It's as simple as that. After only three and a half minutes, England have got the goal
[1007.56 - 1013.24] P:1710.01 E:0.072416 |  that Fabio Capello demanded, and for Wayne Rooney, it's his ninth for this international season.
[1013.24 - 1017.48] P:1628.83 E:0.073592 |  Yeah, really quite simple, because the problem for Andorra is they're playing with three centrebacks,
[1017.48 - 1022.68] P:1718.58 E:0.074577 |  and not one of them moved as soon as Rooney moved. Good ball in from Johnson. Nobody moved. Yeah,
[1022.68 - 1026.44] P:1803.46 E:0.068884 |  the easiest of headers, just a knock it past the goalkeeper. I mean, just hit the bar with the
[1026.44 - 1031.48] P:1670.30 E:0.061314 |  previous header as well. Well, as I was saying about there are goals there tonight for Rooney
[1031.48 - 1037.48] P:1638.80 E:0.058972 |  and Crouch, and Rooney could hardly miss that one. England won Andorra nil, and bearing in mind,
[1037.48 - 1043.24] P:1687.50 E:0.068674 |  Andorra hardly ever score. That should just about be game over already, and Andorra have only scored
[1043.24 - 1050.44] P:1638.33 E:0.058224 |  two goals in this group, and both against Belarus. England won Andorra nil, and now less got for
[1050.44 - 1055.08] P:1881.32 E:0.061138 |  England, finding Ashley Cole down the near side. We'll get a word from England's former manager
[1055.08 - 1059.96] P:1898.17 E:0.065661 |  Graham Taylor, who's with us tonight in a moment. Johnson, who put the cross in for Rooney to
[1059.96 - 1065.32] P:1956.05 E:0.072849 |  Walcott. Walcott, was he fouled? Referee says play on. No, it looked like a foul. I need to see a bit more
[1065.32 - 1071.88] P:1977.15 E:0.053440 |  than Walcott tonight. I need to see a bit of robustness. That was Mark Tugetsch, and not Graham.
[1071.88 - 1076.60] P:2006.59 E:0.066991 |  Graham Taylor, can you hear me? Tell us what you think so far. Yeah, I hope it's just laughing there
[1076.60 - 1082.92] P:1950.33 E:0.070742 |  with Mark. I think what it shows is that we can, if England keep playing as they have played in
[1082.92 - 1089.08] P:1937.83 E:0.075044 |  this opening spell, there is the possibility of seeing a double figure win tonight, because Mark
[1089.08 - 1094.92] P:1812.96 E:0.065794 |  is quite right. They're playing 5-4-1 on Andorra, and they're not getting near the ball anyhow,
[1094.92 - 1100.20] P:1940.30 E:0.061846 |  so there's going to be great opportunities to get double figures. Thank you, Graham. Damage
[1100.20 - 1105.08] P:1846.25 E:0.071345 |  limitation already then from Andorra. Trailing here 1-0. Rooney's got the goal. Andorra look for
[1105.08 - 1109.80] P:1822.87 E:0.075465 |  Silver, it's a wayward pass. Terry Clecks, England barely need a back four at the moment really,
[1109.80 - 1115.00] P:1840.26 E:0.073310 |  as Gerard floats a beautiful ball into Ashley Cole's path. Cole checks just inside the Andorra
[1115.00 - 1119.80] P:1867.54 E:0.062360 |  half, lays it back to Gerard. Good movement here from England. Long ball from Gerard to the far
[1119.80 - 1124.92] P:1860.86 E:0.070615 |  side. Walcott waits, brings it down and finds Johnson. Johnson's just really joining all the
[1124.92 - 1129.88] P:1700.52 E:0.059224 |  attacks at the moment for England. England still keep the possession with Lescott. Lampard, back
[1129.88 - 1134.76] P:1881.24 E:0.071576 |  again to John Terry. Nice. England moving it around so much quicker than they did in Kazakhstan
[1134.76 - 1139.56] P:2021.52 E:0.066822 |  in those early stages. Ashley Cole again now, trying to pick out Crouch. Galky, the fist set
[1139.56 - 1143.88] P:1886.10 E:0.071712 |  away, not too clever. That is on the edge of the penalty area, and it'll be cleared by Jimenez,
[1143.88 - 1147.32] P:1713.97 E:0.062694 |  but it's a very hurry clearance out of play for an England throw-in. Mark Lawrence,
[1147.32 - 1150.92] P:1561.90 E:0.059079 |  and that's a poor attempt at stopping the cross from the goal-kick, but he wants to get his gloves
[1150.92 - 1160.84] P:1457.77 E:0.054235 |  dirty. England throw-in taken, and Lescott here again, just a matter of days really since the FA
[1161.72 - 1165.24] P:1662.85 E:0.070571 |  Long ball to the far side, looking for Walcott. Headed away by the left back.
[1165.24 - 1170.60] P:1829.14 E:0.070811 |  Jimenez again once more, easily dispossessed by Johnson, and Johnson's won himself a free kick.
[1170.60 - 1176.28] P:1719.18 E:0.069301 |  Andorra do have a reputation for being quite physical. 19 yellow cards they picked up in
[1176.28 - 1181.80] P:1662.22 E:0.072366 |  this group. The two lemurs, by the way, have already had a suspension. They both had three yellow
[1181.80 - 1187.32] P:1745.94 E:0.063403 |  cards, and it's a free kick, and it'll be David Beckham once more, and Lescott and Terry both in
[1187.32 - 1192.68] P:1932.14 E:0.058212 |  the penalty area. Crouch raises both arms as well. Again, Lampard's lurking on the edge of the box.
[1192.68 - 1198.20] P:1873.43 E:0.063975 |  Beckham legs a stride, prepares to take the free kick. It's England one, Andorra nil here at Wembley
[1198.20 - 1203.24] P:1794.63 E:0.070461 |  already. Beckham's free kick is taken, and again, cold over the fist out of the penalty area.
[1203.24 - 1208.52] P:1937.91 E:0.064496 |  Lampard tries to head it back in again. Walcott goes steaming in, header on from Crouch. Lescott
[1208.52 - 1213.56] P:1939.13 E:0.062659 |  has stayed forward following that free kick. Andorra completely failing to clear, and now it's Beckham
[1213.56 - 1218.36] P:1896.86 E:0.062214 |  once more. Beckham onto Crouch, gets away from the defender well. He goes down under the challenge,
[1218.36 - 1223.24] P:1911.34 E:0.066004 |  looks for the free kick, and the Dutch referee was play on. Well, at the moment, looking at Andorra
[1223.24 - 1227.64] P:1745.05 E:0.063870 |  there where they were trying to clear the ball, Mike, they had six strong across the back. So
[1227.64 - 1231.64] P:1792.56 E:0.072193 |  it shows you where a total farce this game is. Well, and every time they clear, they just hit it
[1231.64 - 1236.04] P:1868.98 E:0.078442 |  straight back to a white shirt, and then now David Beckham tries to release Ashley Cole, but the ball
[1236.04 - 1241.08] P:1828.33 E:0.064622 |  just jumps away from him. Cole acknowledges Beckham's attempt, and it's a throw into Andorra
[1241.08 - 1246.28] P:1800.82 E:0.058597 |  near side. Pitch is good. Yes, it is, isn't it? I had David Plates head out before as well.
[1247.88 - 1251.24] P:1846.67 E:0.074930 |  It certainly wasn't good the last time they played here, but it's been relayed since the
[1251.96 - 1257.32] P:1773.95 E:0.065259 |  Ukraine match. But yeah, Fabio Capallo had a lot of concerns about the pitch, but the surface
[1257.32 - 1263.00] P:1813.40 E:0.059896 |  looks okay so far here this evening. Crouch now, and Lampard. Rooney's got the goal. Lampard again,
[1263.00 - 1266.84] P:1787.65 E:0.063522 |  couple of Andorra defenders with him. Lampard brushed the first one aside, but not the second,
[1266.84 - 1272.60] P:1746.50 E:0.057883 |  and in comes Alderfantz Lima with the challenge. And well, the whole of the game so far, really,
[1272.60 - 1277.72] P:1848.66 E:0.060713 |  the opening eight minutes has been played inside the Andorra in half. Steven Gerard now, back into
[1277.72 - 1282.04] P:1852.80 E:0.069338 |  midfield where Beckham is unmarked. Beckham immediately gives it to Walcott down the right,
[1282.04 - 1286.76] P:1949.66 E:0.066586 |  an invitation to take on the defenders. Two of the defenders there. Walcott goes down. No free kick
[1286.76 - 1291.88] P:1852.90 E:0.062899 |  is given. Andorra under great pressure once more. Eventually get it out, off an England player for
[1291.96 - 1296.76] P:1593.61 E:0.056557 |  throwing over on the far side of the field. England one, Andorra nil. Remember then earlier today,
[1296.76 - 1302.52] P:1748.32 E:0.057387 |  the Ukraine beat Kazakhstan by only two goals to one. Ukraine and Croatia now 11 points each from
[1302.52 - 1306.92] P:1743.65 E:0.065835 |  six, but England have a chance to go 10 points clear tonight at the top of the group. It's a free
[1306.92 - 1313.32] P:1546.17 E:0.059230 |  kick to England this time. Walcott's been fouled, and Andorra and player gone down as well. I've
[1313.32 - 1318.28] P:1557.04 E:0.062834 |  no idea where I think there was no challenge on in the tour. I don't think that he's... I think he
[1318.28 - 1323.88] P:1548.58 E:0.064346 |  tried to challenge Walcott. He's probably hurt himself. Referee is just checking on him to make
[1323.88 - 1329.08] P:1593.43 E:0.063436 |  sure that he's not feigning injury. He's certainly not going to allow the trainer on, I don't think.
[1329.96 - 1333.32] P:1590.02 E:0.077247 |  And it's going to be an England free kick. And this is one of the reasons why
[1333.32 - 1338.28] P:1625.62 E:0.076528 |  David Beckham's been reinstated to try and tease the Andorran defenders with his delivery from set
[1338.28 - 1343.40] P:1700.70 E:0.066668 |  pieces. Beckham's free kick. Again, Terry and Lescott have gone forward. Crouch is the tallest
[1343.40 - 1348.84] P:1797.02 E:0.064749 |  player in the penalty area. Beckham now prepares. In goes the free kick. Oh, Crouch didn't really get
[1349.40 - 1352.84] P:1755.91 E:0.079095 |  on the end of that one at all. He seemed off balance. He's such a tall man. He should have just
[1352.84 - 1356.84] P:1568.37 E:0.069656 |  directed that at goal. Instead, he's headed it wide. I don't think he really attacked it,
[1356.84 - 1361.32] P:1725.81 E:0.075568 |  Mike. I think he's coming all the way. He just didn't really attack it. He let the ball hit his head
[1361.32 - 1367.80] P:1469.18 E:0.063407 |  rather than coming attacking a downward header. And it's two-nil. Koldo in the Andorran goal,
[1367.80 - 1375.08] P:1614.84 E:0.058890 |  then preparing to clear for a side who look completely intimidated here at Wembley, the England
[1375.08 - 1382.04] P:1632.70 E:0.064761 |  fans. It's about half full here this evening, making good noise, though. The team are responding.
[1382.04 - 1388.28] P:1647.44 E:0.064062 |  Wolcott for England. It's about 98% possession so far from England. Lampard inside the centre
[1388.28 - 1393.32] P:1765.25 E:0.064170 |  circle. Lampard now looking to release Gerard down the left. Gerard hugs the touch line and then
[1393.40 - 1397.64] P:1714.07 E:0.071492 |  cuts in from this near touch line. Gerard shoots and the goalkeeper seem to see it late and turns
[1397.64 - 1402.12] P:1632.81 E:0.074818 |  it around for corner kick. Yeah, it seemed for a split second, Mike. He'd gone down very, very late
[1402.12 - 1407.88] P:1529.80 E:0.056851 |  in the goalkeeper. At least he made the save. Beckham takes the corners, right hand left, and
[1408.44 - 1413.40] P:1642.42 E:0.068307 |  Crouch waits and hopes that this time, if it comes his way, he can make a better effort with a header.
[1415.32 - 1420.04] P:1936.10 E:0.078880 |  Corner kick to England. Rooney inside the six-yard area. In goes the kick. Again, it's a fist from
[1420.04 - 1425.16] P:1794.12 E:0.068293 |  Caldo. This time he gets good distance. It's almost back on the halfway line. Ashley Cole retrieves.
[1425.16 - 1429.72] P:1681.14 E:0.064817 |  Wolcott immediately back in possession again. England one-and-or and nil. Ball in from Wolcott
[1429.72 - 1435.08] P:1767.44 E:0.067402 |  towards Crouch. Crouch reaches for it and feeds David Beckham 30 yards away. Beckham's ball.
[1435.88 - 1438.68] P:1616.64 E:0.081144 |  Well, you could see what he was trying to do because Wolcott was steaming in from the right
[1438.68 - 1443.32] P:1558.64 E:0.066268 |  hand side. He just had too much pace on it, though, and it's a goal kick. Yeah, just unfortunate because
[1443.32 - 1448.04] P:1417.06 E:0.066642 |  Jim Eneth, who was marking Wolcott, just let him run and a little bit more accuracy with the pass
[1448.04 - 1453.88] P:1303.54 E:0.065414 |  in Wolcott was in. We've got the England World Cup squad members here who received,
[1453.88 - 1458.12] P:1459.05 E:0.073241 |  belatedly, their medals today for being part of the 66 squad. I think they're going to be on the
[1458.12 - 1464.60] P:1614.92 E:0.071255 |  pitch at halftime. And incidentally, it was exactly 47 years ago that England went out of the 62 World
[1464.60 - 1468.52] P:1594.83 E:0.068216 |  Cup in Chile against Brazil. Some of the men who were here tonight played in that game, and that
[1468.52 - 1473.32] P:1733.56 E:0.066897 |  was England's last World Cup game before they came to Wembley to play Uruguay at the start of the
[1473.32 - 1477.64] P:1853.88 E:0.068517 |  66 tournament. So we'll have the likes of Ron Springett and Jimmy Armfield and Ron Flauze and
[1477.72 - 1483.08] P:1809.30 E:0.066470 |  Jimmy Greaves, who all played in Chile in 62. They'll all be coming out at halftime, and I'm sure
[1483.08 - 1487.72] P:1557.23 E:0.054137 |  they're going to get a fantastic welcome. England are leading 1-0. Lampard of England
[1487.72 - 1492.12] P:1834.12 E:0.071731 |  switches the play now and finds Ashley Cole down this near side. He won't have to do too much
[1492.12 - 1497.56] P:1737.32 E:0.056746 |  defending tonight. Ashley Cole's Rooney waits patiently, Cole taking on the defenders, making
[1497.56 - 1502.04] P:1770.48 E:0.073106 |  his way towards the dead ball line. Still Ashley Cole knocks it back to Gerrard on the edge of the
[1502.04 - 1507.56] P:1697.12 E:0.068756 |  area. Square from him to Lampard, England having just so much of the ball. Now John Terry who's
[1507.56 - 1515.24] P:1604.85 E:0.053482 |  inside the andorra half, and why not? Ashley Cole again back in field to Gerrard. There's so much
[1515.24 - 1519.00] P:1859.10 E:0.072745 |  possession here. It's almost embarrassing for England as a high ball comes into crouch and now
[1519.00 - 1525.08] P:1692.50 E:0.067202 |  Silver used his arm even when Andorra get the ball down field to their striker. He can't control it.
[1525.08 - 1530.28] P:1787.58 E:0.066298 |  England take a kick quickly and it's Ashley Cole again on the edge of the andorra penalty area.
[1530.28 - 1535.00] P:1731.38 E:0.067944 |  Lampard ball into Gerrard. Gerrard now with too many defenders around him on that occasion.
[1535.56 - 1539.56] P:1795.54 E:0.069833 |  Andorra look to clear. How much ambition will there be in that? Not much because Lescott
[1540.36 - 1544.52] P:1712.79 E:0.069208 |  comes in very, very quickly. The pass was an obvious one and it's straight back again with
[1544.52 - 1548.44] P:1624.50 E:0.067918 |  the team in white and Glenn Johnson over on that right hand side. Walcott's made a run.
[1548.44 - 1553.32] P:1707.50 E:0.064803 |  Johnson Holes plays a shorter pass instead to Lampard on the edge of the centre circle.
[1553.32 - 1558.36] P:1521.26 E:0.065557 |  England 1-0. Andorra 0. In Scotland's group it's Holland 1-0. Holland have already qualified,
[1558.36 - 1563.72] P:1552.20 E:0.064855 |  Rooney now into Lampard. Lampard to Gerrard. Lampard tried to go for the return. He's gone down.
[1563.72 - 1568.20] P:1461.70 E:0.065695 |  There's no free kick though. Referee Ways play on. I'd like to see that again. I thought maybe
[1568.20 - 1572.04] P:1276.22 E:0.063706 |  Manning got blocked off. Frank Lampard. That's something that the Andorrans are very good at doing.
[1572.84 - 1576.68] P:1555.10 E:0.068778 |  Wayne Rooney, yes he did. Sorry mate he did get blocked off. Referee never saw it.
[1576.68 - 1581.00] P:1592.88 E:0.079305 |  Just one little note for you. Wayne Rooney's now got nine goals in this international season
[1581.00 - 1587.96] P:1370.51 E:0.066804 |  and the record is 10 from Gary Lineker in 1991 and he's also now got seven World Cup goals
[1587.96 - 1593.72] P:1522.43 E:0.069004 |  in this group and the record is eight. Tommy Taylor in 1958. So if Rooney gets another goal here tonight,
[1594.28 - 1597.80] P:1515.50 E:0.073353 |  well he'll be able to equal the Lineker. He'll go on to beat Tommy Taylor anyway,
[1597.80 - 1602.12] P:1621.13 E:0.057166 |  what I would have thought, with three more games to go after this one in the group.
[1602.12 - 1607.24] P:1613.72 E:0.057741 |  England 1-0. Andorra 0. Gerrard now down the England near side the field and they're just backing
[1607.24 - 1612.36] P:1671.06 E:0.059843 |  off him at the moment. This is dangerous for Andorra. Gerrard to the captain Terry and now Becken.
[1612.36 - 1616.76] P:1656.89 E:0.068948 |  Becken enjoying the free roll he has in the centre. Walcott up against two defenders.
[1616.84 - 1621.72] P:1604.51 E:0.070448 |  Walcott has support from Johnson. Johnson level with the edge of the Andorra in area.
[1621.72 - 1626.28] P:1654.13 E:0.068958 |  In it goes from Gerrard to Rooney. Back again almost and now Gerrard slips as he tries to tee
[1626.28 - 1631.64] P:1484.01 E:0.067101 |  that one up. He slips and so Andorra's goalkeeper, Coldo, can pick up the loose ball. That is really
[1631.64 - 1636.28] P:1583.59 E:0.062669 |  good play until Gerrard. I think, well how happened, he tried to clip the crossing and just play right
[1636.28 - 1640.68] P:1546.44 E:0.064170 |  foot against the left. It was good play from England. England in Kazakhstan on an awful pitch,
[1640.68 - 1645.40] P:1600.00 E:0.067649 |  wanted just too many touches at times but then zipping the ball around well here on a better
[1645.40 - 1649.40] P:1717.36 E:0.067452 |  surface. Wembley, Fabio Capello is in the technical area at the moment but he can't be too displeased
[1649.40 - 1654.52] P:1554.54 E:0.057006 |  with what he's seeing. Andorra barely crossed the halfway line. They have the ball now with
[1654.52 - 1662.28] P:1523.96 E:0.047050 |  number 11 Andorra himself and now it's back into the back five with Sonagy. Over on the left hand
[1662.28 - 1666.04] P:1714.27 E:0.060791 |  side, Jamea the left back. That's an awful pass though straight to Becken on the halfway line.
[1666.04 - 1671.32] P:1592.13 E:0.060736 |  I've got a question for you. How can you wear orange boots if you're the right back for Andorra?
[1672.28 - 1677.48] P:1580.89 E:0.057024 |  Well, the thing they normally say there is you have to be a good player, don't you, to get away
[1677.48 - 1680.84] P:1734.79 E:0.070464 |  with boots like that. I'm not sure how good he is as Rooney floats the cross. And Alan's just
[1680.84 - 1687.56] P:1643.40 E:0.055611 |  asking me a question about Tommy Taylor. How many games did they play in fifths? Certainly not as many
[1688.12 - 1694.44] P:1504.68 E:0.057409 |  as England are playing these days. Probably let me just think 1958, no more than maybe half a dozen.
[1694.44 - 1700.36] P:1638.35 E:0.049019 |  But you were there there weren't you? Yeah, that's right. I do remember watching that tournament
[1700.36 - 1707.64] P:1485.92 E:0.047684 |  on telly. I have to tell you. Yeah. And Tommy Taylor, of course, tragically killed in the
[1707.64 - 1713.40] P:1632.12 E:0.062360 |  Munich air disaster in 1958. England now on the ball over on the far side of the field. They lead
[1713.40 - 1719.48] P:1637.50 E:0.051087 |  here by one goal to nil. Here they come again. Lampard to Ashley Cole. Ashley Cole down the line to
[1719.48 - 1725.56] P:1646.64 E:0.054543 |  Rooney. Rooney checks and then flicks the ball onto Lampard. Lampard's cushioned header, but the goal
[1725.56 - 1730.36] P:1729.03 E:0.064249 |  keepers there again. I do remember that Brazil England game that I mentioned 47 years ago today
[1730.36 - 1737.56] P:1668.70 E:0.059180 |  listening to commentary on the game in the car on a journey with the folks back in 62. So Tom Finney
[1737.56 - 1743.88] P:1621.81 E:0.068220 |  in that team wasn't he? In 62? No, no, no, no. And on the 60 one nil the USA defeat. Johnny Haynes and
[1743.88 - 1749.40] P:1682.38 E:0.059278 |  Jerry Hitchens got the goal and Jimmy Greaves. England have the possession again just for once
[1749.40 - 1754.76] P:1536.95 E:0.054889 |  they're back inside their own half. David Beckham, nobody anywhere near him from Andorra.
[1754.84 - 1760.28] P:1771.88 E:0.059711 |  Retreating once more. Gerard to Lampard. Lampard spots Johnson over on the far side. Should have
[1760.28 - 1766.12] P:1646.81 E:0.059699 |  found him didn't. Only finds an Andorra. Now they approach the half way line, but immediately Johnson
[1766.12 - 1771.64] P:1638.93 E:0.062189 |  closes them down. Still have the ball with Jimenez. Jimenez now over to the left hand side where
[1771.64 - 1777.64] P:1506.17 E:0.052570 |  Silver is immediately swept aside by John Terry. Just as the content marketer. Well, the hopeless
[1777.64 - 1782.60] P:1719.75 E:0.067706 |  aren't the Andorra, but we knew that before we started. They've just got arguably 45 yards away
[1782.60 - 1787.88] P:1541.98 E:0.054817 |  from England's goal. How long we played? Let me tell you 16 minutes. I bet there's been some
[1787.88 - 1792.20] P:1792.18 E:0.068270 |  interest in interest in spread bets tonight. They haven't kept a clean sheet for over two years.
[1792.92 - 1799.48] P:1453.48 E:0.055721 |  18 games now they've conceded in all of them. And it's a throw to England. England did have
[1799.48 - 1805.08] P:1654.92 E:0.063070 |  problems with Andorra in the in Capello's first game, qualifying game to the extent that he had
[1805.08 - 1809.48] P:1861.26 E:0.064087 |  to make a couple of changes at halftime. Joe Cole was brought on to score the goals in the end that
[1809.48 - 1814.04] P:1826.74 E:0.066673 |  mattered here. Rooney's got an early one after three and a half minutes on the ball is again near
[1814.04 - 1818.04] P:1795.93 E:0.070553 |  side down the England left. Ashley Cole hit system with a bit of pace doesn't reach crouch on this
[1818.04 - 1824.92] P:1917.17 E:0.061349 |  occasion and Merino now near side the Andorra and right gives it back to the man in those boots.
[1824.92 - 1830.84] P:1744.47 E:0.058369 |  The right back Ayala. They've got some famous names. All right, but Ayala and Vieira and Silver.
[1831.72 - 1835.80] P:1630.11 E:0.064668 |  But they're not the ones that we have come to know over the years. The famous ones.
[1835.80 - 1841.96] P:1767.61 E:0.065673 |  Silver is high. Ho is knee. Throw into Andorra. One nil down could easily have been two or three
[1841.96 - 1846.92] P:1833.83 E:0.063551 |  already. It's Fabio Capello still down there making sure that they keep the concentration up.
[1847.72 - 1853.56] P:1592.46 E:0.062361 |  John Terry of England. Terry now lovely ball onto Walcott waits for it to come onto him.
[1853.56 - 1859.00] P:1743.76 E:0.069290 |  Little bit of pace acceleration. They got it behind Johnson. Johnson checks back again to Walcott.
[1859.00 - 1863.48] P:1701.89 E:0.063579 |  Well, Johnson would have got the return but he was brought down by the defender over on the far
[1863.48 - 1869.08] P:1666.91 E:0.068275 |  side and the Dutch referee says calm down and England have a free kick. It's just absolutely no
[1869.08 - 1874.20] P:1607.48 E:0.067329 |  attempt whatsoever to play the ball and just block Johnson off. Should be yellow carbations.
[1874.20 - 1879.08] P:1510.03 E:0.058818 |  The only way they'll stop the Andorra's from filing all night. Another Beckham free kick from a long
[1879.08 - 1883.88] P:1786.95 E:0.068480 |  way out over on the right. This time he's knocked it short to Johnson who is unmarked. Johnson hasn't
[1883.88 - 1889.40] P:1564.21 E:0.060468 |  got it forward though. Andorra with a very high clearance. Crowd making as much noise as they
[1889.40 - 1894.68] P:1553.51 E:0.070099 |  can here. Maybe 45, 50,000 something like that. Quite a lot of vacant seats in the top tier over
[1894.68 - 1898.84] P:1758.34 E:0.065701 |  on the far side as England sweeper high boards towards Gerard. He controls it on his neck.
[1898.84 - 1906.44] P:1503.13 E:0.060671 |  Then he can't get in off that defender Ayala and England have a throw. But it's just nonstop pressure
[1906.44 - 1912.68] P:1453.94 E:0.065452 |  here on the Andorran defenders from England leading one nil and already on their way to a 10
[1912.68 - 1919.24] P:1546.48 E:0.059165 |  point lead at the top of this group before the summer recess. Now Lantard. Lantard again
[1919.24 - 1923.88] P:1764.16 E:0.071546 |  to Ashley Cole has been given a lot of room down the left hand side. In comes a cross. It should
[1923.88 - 1928.12] P:1469.08 E:0.069933 |  be headed away by the defender, but it'll drop to, well, it should have, I thought it was going to
[1928.12 - 1932.92] P:1652.21 E:0.069797 |  drop to Johnson. It's Beckham instead. And in the end, it's Il Defon's limo with a header. But every
[1932.92 - 1937.56] P:1811.38 E:0.063064 |  time they clear, it comes straight back to the team playing at home. Terry in acres of space.
[1937.56 - 1942.20] P:1737.63 E:0.061743 |  Now Gerard's gone into the centre. Half thought about the shot, I think. Then does get the shot in
[1942.20 - 1946.44] P:1562.02 E:0.070704 |  and I think he's got a corner out of it. It's got a deflection and the corner's been given down
[1946.44 - 1950.60] P:1664.40 E:0.066226 |  the right far side. Yeah, it's actually a good block by the defender because Gerard just dropped
[1950.60 - 1954.76] P:1675.72 E:0.068781 |  the shoulder, didn't he? He just deflected just over the top of the crossbar. I just think with
[1954.76 - 1959.40] P:1695.03 E:0.076667 |  England, it's going through a little stage, Matt, where they need to work the ball a little bit
[1959.40 - 1965.40] P:1585.30 E:0.057031 |  quicker. Beckham prepares himself over on the right. England sends the second. In comes the
[1965.40 - 1970.68] P:1553.29 E:0.070656 |  corner. It doesn't reach Rooney. Again, Lima heads it away. Wolcott now has it back again and tries
[1970.68 - 1975.56] P:1615.52 E:0.065491 |  a big effort from almost 30 yards, Rooney, but the goalkeeper wasn't testing. I don't think the
[1975.56 - 1978.68] P:1541.88 E:0.066463 |  goalkeeper even moved. I think he knew straight away it was going in line. Have you played in many
[1978.68 - 1983.32] P:1387.98 E:0.051561 |  games like this, where you have the ball for virtually 99% of the time? All the games are played
[1983.32 - 1989.32] P:1373.32 E:0.054090 |  for Liverpool. Yeah, I thought you said that. We just keep setting him up for him really, don't we?
[1989.32 - 1994.20] P:1853.56 E:0.075655 |  You realise as soon as you've left your mouth on it, striking the true mid-wicket.
[1996.68 - 2001.88] P:1673.68 E:0.064614 |  Gold kick for Caldo and Crouch heads it straight back again. Rooney doesn't chase this one out,
[2001.88 - 2007.72] P:1708.80 E:0.069660 |  it's a lost cause. See, Tony Loom is just there trying in vain, I think, to bring them forward.
[2008.28 - 2015.72] P:1552.03 E:0.061520 |  They're just all in the retreat here as Caldo now clears into the England half. It's about the only
[2015.72 - 2019.16] P:1689.12 E:0.068779 |  way I think that Andorra are going to get the ball into the England half through goal kicks from
[2019.16 - 2024.44] P:1650.57 E:0.066147 |  Caldo. Ball bobbles around over on the far side. Johnson does enough to make sure he's got the
[2024.44 - 2029.56] P:1549.07 E:0.055937 |  throw in and England have a throw short of the half wayline. We've played just over 20 minutes
[2029.56 - 2035.24] P:1602.59 E:0.061753 |  of the first half. He's just joining us here from Wembley. England got an early goal through Rooney,
[2035.24 - 2041.56] P:1581.42 E:0.053663 |  header straight forward from Glenn Johnson's cross. And now the throw in taken. Crouch is playing
[2041.56 - 2047.88] P:1585.12 E:0.065328 |  tonight in place of Heskey. Lescott is in for Upson and David Beckham starts because of Barry's
[2047.88 - 2053.88] P:1705.63 E:0.060567 |  suspension. Rooney now, a little bit deep for him this time. Rooney's floater to the far side.
[2053.88 - 2058.68] P:1796.95 E:0.069931 |  Crouch is there, reaches for it and Crouch just wouldn't come down from him in the end against
[2058.68 - 2065.80] P:1645.53 E:0.053534 |  the defender and Andorra have a throw in. Fabio Catello doesn't look very happy actually Mark.
[2065.80 - 2070.60] P:1733.53 E:0.074759 |  He's just shaking his head a bit. When England started, they started bradly and what they did
[2070.60 - 2075.32] P:1547.69 E:0.065704 |  might, the switch the ball right to left, left to right, very, very quickly with a packed defense.
[2075.32 - 2079.80] P:1658.81 E:0.068791 |  It makes all the difference. It's just a little bit obvious at the moment and England have started
[2079.80 - 2085.08] P:1675.06 E:0.074379 |  to sling one or two crosses in and quite honestly, the two Lima brothers are decent in the air.
[2085.40 - 2089.00] P:1543.88 E:0.063666 |  And keep playing like this England, they're going to have a headache because they're dealing
[2089.00 - 2093.08] P:1641.19 E:0.068024 |  with everything that's coming in. Well, it is monotonous. I suppose sometimes you can have too
[2093.08 - 2099.16] P:1496.79 E:0.064037 |  much of the ball. Fabio Catello has very high standards. He's a perfectionist and now he's
[2099.16 - 2104.44] P:1805.56 E:0.077486 |  using Stuart Pierce, the under 21 coach to come out and also get an instruction across. He was
[2104.44 - 2109.64] P:1849.63 E:0.065201 |  talking to Rooney and what he's saying to Rooney is just stay and play up front for once in your
[2109.64 - 2114.28] P:1586.77 E:0.068155 |  life in this game. Certainly you don't have to go rampaging everywhere and help everybody else.
[2114.28 - 2118.92] P:1767.00 E:0.070640 |  Stay up front and cause a problem. Well, that was what Capello was saying yesterday in terms
[2118.92 - 2123.08] P:1802.20 E:0.078676 |  of advice he's given to Wayne Rooney for scoring goals. Just get into the penalty area, Wayne.
[2123.08 - 2126.36] P:1750.02 E:0.075831 |  Well, he did that early on here and scored. England lead one. Now they're just going off
[2126.36 - 2129.72] P:1491.43 E:0.066567 |  the ball a little bit, but now they'll be right back on the ball because commentary is with Alan
[2129.72 - 2137.00] P:1570.38 E:0.054637 |  Green. I'm just enjoying being totally relaxed about the outcome of the game. England will win
[2137.00 - 2143.56] P:1722.85 E:0.057526 |  this game. Whatever the score line, here's Ashley Cole forward. I don't want any clever
[2143.80 - 2148.04] P:1606.43 E:0.060474 |  Dick saying, well, they won't win it if it's 1-1 or if on Dora win 2. You'll only meet. Doesn't
[2148.04 - 2153.56] P:1486.47 E:0.061517 |  matter how many goals England scored tonight, they're going to win the game. And I look at Kazakhstan
[2153.56 - 2158.44] P:1502.48 E:0.060570 |  at the weekend mark and if games only lasted 45 minutes, Kazakhstan would be a decent team,
[2158.44 - 2165.24] P:1531.59 E:0.054271 |  but Andorra have nothing. Gerard, poor cross in from the left hand side, straight into the arms
[2165.24 - 2169.64] P:1484.62 E:0.057252 |  of Caldo and England have actually been guilty of squandering much of the possession they've had.
[2169.64 - 2173.24] P:1445.14 E:0.052359 |  Beckham's given the ball away a number of times and certainly not crossed properly.
[2173.48 - 2178.60] P:1565.68 E:0.069316 |  I was in corners up three kicks. Oh, that was a cheer for it. The silver get to the ball.
[2178.60 - 2184.84] P:1696.49 E:0.065864 |  Silver. No, no, no. Green. Green's first touch. Green's first touch. 23 minutes played. England
[2184.84 - 2189.08] P:1454.02 E:0.061345 |  on the attack again. Didn't last for long. That incredible pressure on Robert Green.
[2191.80 - 2196.04] P:1386.93 E:0.071698 |  Here's a cross played in by Johnson. Walcott is there and Walcott actually
[2196.04 - 2200.92] P:1352.39 E:0.073901 |  was a sort of half blocked by Rooney in terms of trying to get the ball across goal
[2200.92 - 2205.40] P:1568.91 E:0.064253 |  and it's behind for a goal kick. You notice as well that the crosses have started to get longer
[2205.40 - 2210.68] P:1731.51 E:0.076239 |  and deeper. Yes, it really, it really well just played to Andorra's hands. That's exactly what
[2210.68 - 2218.20] P:1458.02 E:0.059681 |  they want. A little bit more invention, a little bit more width needed. A goal kick to Caldo who was
[2218.20 - 2227.16] P:1321.60 E:0.051060 |  booked in Belarus. Here's the goal kick taken. Hit right footed up to the halfway line, headed
[2227.16 - 2231.88] P:1352.02 E:0.057276 |  back by Beckham and away by Sonagy out of the, out of playing the far side of the field for a
[2231.88 - 2236.60] P:1583.35 E:0.059147 |  throw in swing. Actually, the cry tonight, I'm told is actually better than, than we think it is
[2236.60 - 2240.60] P:1661.99 E:0.068567 |  because there are many more in the upper tier on this side of the ground that we can't see.
[2240.60 - 2246.44] P:1619.26 E:0.061551 |  So the attendance we think is near 50,000 than, than 45,000, which is a remarkable effort given the
[2246.44 - 2253.80] P:1570.14 E:0.054862 |  tube strike. Ashley Cole, Tolesko and I taken up by Lampard. Nevitably the plays in the endoring
[2254.44 - 2258.20] P:1434.72 E:0.065046 |  good ball to the far side. Well controlled by Glenn Johnson. Moving to the edge of the
[2258.20 - 2263.48] P:1602.58 E:0.067828 |  penalty, slip the ball in, runny turn, runny turns, slices his shot and is behind for a goal kick.
[2263.48 - 2268.44] P:1679.48 E:0.064285 |  Better play though Alan, wasn't it? Quicker ball out to the right, Johnson came inside on his left
[2268.44 - 2275.08] P:1428.56 E:0.057226 |  foot, played runy in. Much better from England, a little bit more creative. When I look at Andorra,
[2275.08 - 2280.04] P:1656.18 E:0.067888 |  I just see a team that hasn't got any ability, you can excuse that, but they kick, don't they?
[2280.68 - 2285.00] P:1500.01 E:0.063251 |  They kick. No they do. And I mean, the other thing as well, looking at it rather
[2285.00 - 2290.84] P:1557.59 E:0.059457 |  simplistically, if you're Fernando Silva, what, what an error do you get from this match? Nothing.
[2290.84 - 2297.80] P:1448.78 E:0.055407 |  A lone striker. Does he ever get a pass? Awful. Here's Lesko, on to Becker, on the halfway line
[2297.80 - 2302.12] P:1477.39 E:0.061435 |  in the centre circle, now to the left of it, forward to Gero, hugging the left touch line.
[2302.12 - 2308.20] P:1595.26 E:0.053743 |  Gero on his right foot, plays a good ball back to Terry, the captain, and on to the far side
[2308.20 - 2313.40] P:1550.84 E:0.057757 |  and Johnson, wall cuts in field, pass to Walcott, back to Johnson, and now Terry again,
[2314.04 - 2319.08] P:1632.77 E:0.066400 |  overwhelming possession for England, the score line's still only 1-0 and we've played nearly 26
[2319.08 - 2325.24] P:1673.76 E:0.054967 |  minutes. Now Lesko drives the ball forward to Gerard, back to Lampard, Gerard again, on intended,
[2325.24 - 2330.76] P:1676.65 E:0.066752 |  the pass was towards runy, but it's tucked away by Ayala, and another cheer for Robert Green,
[2331.80 - 2334.92] P:1724.51 E:0.077515 |  who comes out of his penalty area, if he doesn't come out of his penalty area, might never see the
[2335.00 - 2341.08] P:1530.96 E:0.061537 |  ball. Beckham, clips it to the left side, good control by Ashley Cole, can't feed it into runy,
[2341.08 - 2344.92] P:1300.54 E:0.060071 |  and it's head out of play by Dunny Lima, oh I thought it had gone out of play with Beckham,
[2344.92 - 2350.60] P:1526.74 E:0.047988 |  kept it in play. Beckham, then plays it forward, not a good pass from Beckham, and it squirts
[2350.60 - 2356.84] P:1336.20 E:0.046289 |  through to the goalkeeper, Caldo. Where's my goal? Oh he's been to get a cup of coffee. Did he only
[2356.84 - 2365.32] P:1533.73 E:0.063270 |  bring one? Not a team player obviously. No he's not a team player. A team player would have brought
[2365.32 - 2371.80] P:1516.02 E:0.061372 |  copies for everybody. Anyway he's too busy doing his notes in the second half. Here's John Terry,
[2372.68 - 2380.28] P:1592.07 E:0.062007 |  to Beckham, Silver's down, he gets the sympathy vote, and the referee will come and see,
[2381.24 - 2388.20] P:1463.15 E:0.055551 |  oh has he got a crack in the head? He says he has. Well he may have done you know, a lampard challenge,
[2388.84 - 2394.36] P:1555.81 E:0.055840 |  well he does appear to have had a crack in the head, so I take it all back, he is an injured party,
[2394.36 - 2403.00] P:1641.42 E:0.047964 |  Silver. Well, Graham Taylor, what are your thoughts Graham? Reminds me of a testimonial game, this
[2403.00 - 2408.60] P:1884.29 E:0.077022 |  does you know, the opposition aren't going to get a touch of the ball, you come to watch one side,
[2408.60 - 2414.36] P:1896.57 E:0.074356 |  and you let them play, and then it's a question of will they deliver. From a point of view I agree
[2414.36 - 2420.20] P:1822.59 E:0.069228 |  with Mark, they've no need to knock the ball into Peter Krauss to tell you the truth, they can play
[2420.20 - 2424.36] P:1829.05 E:0.068086 |  it sharp, they can play it quick, they can play around them, they can play through them, and they
[2424.36 - 2429.72] P:1836.57 E:0.077770 |  just lose that little bit when they start to play it in from those wide angles in the air to them,
[2429.72 - 2435.56] P:1825.15 E:0.057646 |  they've no need to do that. Now Silver's definitely got a crack in the head because his head was wrapped
[2435.56 - 2440.12] P:1837.79 E:0.069793 |  in a towel as he headed the dressing, presumably he needs stitches, he might even be replaced.
[2440.76 - 2445.32] P:1829.57 E:0.058400 |  So they're down to 10-man at the moment, Andorra, which doesn't really change things because they're
[2445.32 - 2450.28] P:1792.60 E:0.073658 |  defending anyway. Well that's going to change the formation isn't it? Yeah it's now by 4. No, now it's
[2450.28 - 2460.84] P:1820.78 E:0.048789 |  1-9-0. Oh we mustn't laugh, there is blood on Silver's head, and he rather threw a bottle down in
[2460.92 - 2466.12] P:1914.25 E:0.061114 |  some disgust. England 1 and Doran Hill, you know, they've seen the 5 live in the BBC, we played 28
[2466.12 - 2471.00] P:1734.40 E:0.066563 |  minutes, so the first half here at Wembley, the odd kickoff presumably was to accommodate
[2471.00 - 2478.68] P:1718.57 E:0.043454 |  Coronation Street. Great idea. Here's Ashley Cole, back to Lampard, and Lampard on to Beckham,
[2478.68 - 2482.84] P:1669.50 E:0.059654 |  Johnson's available down the right flank, and a simple pass by Beckham finds the full back,
[2482.84 - 2487.80] P:1855.33 E:0.063206 |  almost miscontrolled it, but keeps it in play, in it goes to Walcott, Walcott in the penalty,
[2487.80 - 2492.04] P:1801.06 E:0.071078 |  pulls it back, Lampard must score, and side-footed the ball, low into the net,
[2492.04 - 2498.84] P:1683.83 E:0.071416 |  squeezed it through, goalkeeper and defender, England 2 and Doran Hill, Lampard 17th goal for his country.
[2498.84 - 2503.80] P:1759.48 E:0.067925 |  How simple was that, was it? Great into play, width on the right-hand side, great play by
[2503.80 - 2508.52] P:1566.58 E:0.072067 |  Johnson, ball through, play to Walcott, speed of movement, speed of thought, pull back for
[2508.52 - 2514.36] P:1624.24 E:0.061428 |  Lampard, crouched it to a rich, simple as anything 2-0. Well done, and a more accurate
[2514.36 - 2519.40] P:1683.98 E:0.071006 |  reflection of the way the first 29 minutes have gone, England overwhelmingly in control here,
[2519.40 - 2523.56] P:1692.92 E:0.067996 |  and actually they're warming up two substitutions, Andorra, they may as well put both of them on,
[2524.36 - 2527.64] P:1569.10 E:0.062329 |  won't make a blind bit of difference. Yeah, but to be fair they're missing silver.
[2527.64 - 2533.56] P:1516.25 E:0.050783 |  Yeah, well we're all missing silver, especially his tantrum. Anyway, they kick off, there's still
[2533.56 - 2542.04] P:1426.80 E:0.054721 |  down to 10 men, the team all in red, Andorra, and he's back to Elefond's Lima, who hits it up field
[2542.04 - 2546.76] P:1666.29 E:0.066489 |  towards Jiménez on the far side of the field, and the referee from Holland is decided that was
[2546.76 - 2550.84] P:1531.48 E:0.079489 |  a foul challenge by Glenn Johnson, so here's an opportunity actually for Andorra, they've got
[2550.84 - 2556.92] P:1590.20 E:0.059052 |  a free kick, 35 yards of goal. There's nothing wrong with that challenge, Johnson just headed the ball,
[2556.92 - 2561.16] P:1639.51 E:0.060441 |  and the fella threw himself onto the floor, look at him, he's up, there's nothing wrong with him.
[2561.16 - 2569.56] P:1482.86 E:0.051922 |  Right, getting shot of silver on his backside in the tunnel, no wiping his face for blood,
[2569.56 - 2575.16] P:1682.20 E:0.064400 |  a lot of blood, see me for silver. Yeah, there's a genuine team player, Tracy's been out and she's
[2575.16 - 2581.80] P:1678.63 E:0.048385 |  got coffee for everybody. Yeah, but I ordered tea. So free kick, and look, they've committed three
[2581.80 - 2586.04] P:1748.64 E:0.073639 |  plus up to the edge of the England penalty area, the three central defenders, and it's a terrible
[2586.04 - 2592.28] P:1698.73 E:0.054907 |  free kick, which is headed away comfortably by Gerard to the half way line. Ayala plays it forward
[2592.28 - 2597.40] P:1480.54 E:0.059305 |  again up to the penalty area, and above the head of Elefond's Lima behind for a goal kick.
[2597.40 - 2602.36] P:1614.46 E:0.067699 |  Il de Fons Lima was the only Andorra player in the England penalty area at the time,
[2602.36 - 2607.24] P:1621.37 E:0.057700 |  he comes silver. He comes silver, we've missed him greatly, and he's back on the pitch and they're
[2607.24 - 2614.12] P:1469.80 E:0.053542 |  up to a full complement of 11 players. Beckham for England, who lead 2-0 against Andorra,
[2614.12 - 2620.44] P:1124.16 E:0.056844 |  goals from Rooney and Lampard, early goal from Rooney, in the fourth minute Lampard got the
[2620.52 - 2628.04] P:1437.58 E:0.046525 |  second in the 29th, Johnson, into Walcott, and Walcott, a poor pass from Walcott, played left,
[2628.04 - 2633.08] P:1646.46 E:0.049652 |  but well ahead of Gerard, and it rushes behind for a goal kick. I tell you what you can see from
[2633.08 - 2639.24] P:1647.49 E:0.064435 |  England, down there right in the future, certainly Johnson and Walcott on the day, lots and lots
[2639.24 - 2642.60] P:1483.10 E:0.072346 |  of pace, there's no doubt about that. Very comfortable on the ball, Johnson, he's in love the way as
[2642.60 - 2648.04] P:1741.21 E:0.068249 |  well as a fullback, he comes inside and therefore has an option in terms of his passes, he really
[2648.04 - 2652.92] P:1654.71 E:0.065076 |  has improved since he left Chelsea. Yeah, but you're still happy with him defensively, Mark?
[2653.48 - 2657.80] P:1691.95 E:0.062897 |  Yeah, I think so, that's a great problem, and if you look around World Football,
[2657.80 - 2661.32] P:1632.00 E:0.055554 |  there aren't too many left-sided players that are going to cause you too many problems.
[2661.32 - 2665.64] P:1829.65 E:0.066244 |  Okay, here's Walcott holding off two challenges rushing forward, towards the
[2665.64 - 2669.24] P:1783.64 E:0.065307 |  penalty area, defender gets in a tackle and it's behind for an England corner.
[2669.96 - 2675.72] P:1769.40 E:0.062527 |  13 minutes to go to halftime, David Beckham, and no great hurray, goes across to the corner,
[2675.72 - 2679.80] P:1721.54 E:0.065698 |  acknowledges the applause from the England fans on the far side of the field, who unquestionably
[2679.80 - 2686.20] P:1796.56 E:0.061647 |  love the former captain, his 112th captainite for this country, and he will close in on Peter
[2686.20 - 2692.20] P:1892.30 E:0.054361 |  Shilton's record, takes the corner short to Johnson, Johnson now into Walcott and Walcott,
[2692.20 - 2696.68] P:1754.38 E:0.056470 |  I think he was attempting a shot, but he got it all wrong and he just chipped it behind for a goal
[2696.68 - 2701.88] P:1510.80 E:0.048407 |  kick. I think he hit it right for onto left and it just spooned over, didn't it? What do you think
[2701.88 - 2706.60] P:1678.85 E:0.066847 |  the Andorra manager says to his players at halftime? Great start lads, it's only 2-0,
[2707.64 - 2712.44] P:1669.75 E:0.064432 |  keep it going, remember our record deficit is 8-1 or 7-0, do anything better than that,
[2712.44 - 2715.72] P:1685.39 E:0.065362 |  be great. So keep it down? Keep it down. Well what else is there? There's nothing else?
[2715.72 - 2719.88] P:1479.13 E:0.062257 |  Well no, not something else. I'm not getting it, there's just nothing for them to do.
[2720.76 - 2725.80] P:1607.51 E:0.061504 |  I just don't see the point of a team like this competing in a regular qualifying group,
[2725.80 - 2729.40] P:1695.91 E:0.062830 |  there should be pre-qualifying in European Championship and World Cups.
[2729.72 - 2735.64] P:1453.89 E:0.051959 |  On the half-way line it's with Andorra, for Andorra and he's done well inside the centre
[2735.64 - 2740.36] P:1603.43 E:0.072259 |  circle, plays it on to Moreno, Moreno shoots from long range and just for a second there,
[2740.36 - 2745.32] P:1663.63 E:0.066036 |  Robert Green thought I'd better not let this one in and he got across his goal line and was happy
[2745.32 - 2748.76] P:1722.40 E:0.078641 |  to see it go over the crossbar. He just had to scamper a little bit. Just a little bit.
[2749.80 - 2757.16] P:1727.25 E:0.067001 |  Well you can't have that against your record on your CV, letting Goal score by Andorra from 25 yards,
[2757.88 - 2762.92] P:1549.89 E:0.062804 |  Lampard, good ball to the far side to Johnson, the England fullback, he's really playing right
[2762.92 - 2769.64] P:1575.85 E:0.049568 |  midfield. Hardly any need for any England defence tonight. Beckham in the centre of midfield,
[2769.64 - 2774.20] P:1674.47 E:0.060492 |  gets the ball to Lampard, back it goes to Beckham who's inside the centre circle,
[2774.20 - 2779.96] P:1685.41 E:0.072772 |  on to the man who's succeeded him as captain, John Terry, to Rooney, Terry, Rooney again,
[2779.96 - 2784.92] P:1770.67 E:0.064180 |  England patient, the bill up and that's better than hitting it long. Here's Ashley Cole on the left
[2784.92 - 2791.24] P:1762.76 E:0.057284 |  side, back to Wayne Rooney and Rooney, clips the ball towards the far side, no Andorra prayer
[2791.24 - 2796.28] P:1775.88 E:0.064774 |  with a 30 yards of Glenn Johnson, Johnson controls it, moves forward, edge of their penalty area,
[2796.28 - 2800.76] P:1861.07 E:0.070540 |  looking to lay it off for a shot, too many red shirts between him and Goal, takes it the other way,
[2800.76 - 2805.72] P:1815.24 E:0.061926 |  goes wide, well done Glenn Johnson, can't get the ball back properly, might get another chance and
[2805.72 - 2810.36] P:1959.78 E:0.068016 |  he's won a corner. He's been England's best player, you know, the most creative certainly.
[2811.08 - 2815.08] P:1831.22 E:0.066725 |  And Walcott's been quite clever actually, when Johnson's had the ball he stepped inside and
[2815.08 - 2819.56] P:1654.26 E:0.070572 |  given him some room to take on his marker. Jero takes the corner, not Beckham, played in,
[2819.56 - 2824.92] P:1627.68 E:0.064322 |  Terry was there, heads it down, he was being led down and the ball is finally clear, at least it
[2824.92 - 2829.80] P:1761.29 E:0.064449 |  goes to Walcott, on to Jero, another cross from the right, in towards the near post, headed up in
[2829.80 - 2835.48] P:1725.82 E:0.059899 |  the air, crouches there and sort of moved his body in the general direction, it came off a defender
[2835.48 - 2839.64] P:1615.75 E:0.054683 |  and is behind for a corner and this one, Beckham will take. I think that might have actually
[2839.64 - 2846.52] P:1563.97 E:0.055814 |  been Silver defending in his own penalty area, shot. Probably off the gash in his head,
[2847.88 - 2853.16] P:1497.96 E:0.054560 |  Beckham with a corner, how many minutes to halftime, a little over 10, right footed from the left,
[2853.16 - 2857.48] P:1508.45 E:0.060895 |  in towards the far post and that should have been a header in at goal by Lescott,
[2857.48 - 2861.24] P:1518.79 E:0.051948 |  poor header. It was, I think he just took his eye off it at the last moment, certainly any
[2861.24 - 2867.32] P:1367.51 E:0.049000 |  contact, it's 3-0, decent delivery as you would expect. Yeah, he should have done better.
[2867.40 - 2873.00] P:1248.88 E:0.042907 |  Yeah. Grant Taylor, how are you doing down there? What are you? It's a bad island,
[2873.00 - 2879.48] P:1611.88 E:0.051121 |  25 yards away. How do you give him your coffee? About that. Right, what about the second goal?
[2879.48 - 2885.00] P:1715.76 E:0.064207 |  I thought it was an example of what Mark was saying, it was sharp, it was quick, Walcott pulled it
[2885.00 - 2888.68] P:1623.22 E:0.069537 |  back on the floor and I think that, you know England have to keep doing that, move the ball
[2888.68 - 2894.68] P:1713.10 E:0.057582 |  quickly, keep it on the floor, move yourselves and you'll just open them at will. Here's England
[2894.68 - 2900.76] P:1518.17 E:0.060933 |  leading 2-0, 10 minutes to go halftime here at Wembley Stadium and it's been, you know, reasonably
[2900.76 - 2904.52] P:1493.82 E:0.063960 |  entertaining. I think if it was, you know, sort of nil, they would all be saying, well, when are
[2904.52 - 2909.48] P:1650.36 E:0.052288 |  you going to score? But it just feels comfortable. It's going to be seven wins out of seven,
[2909.48 - 2914.20] P:1583.70 E:0.069424 |  by the way, Holland are beating Norway 1-0, they too will have 21 points in their first seven games.
[2915.08 - 2921.48] P:1513.90 E:0.059353 |  On the far side, Johnson pulls the ball in left footed, cleared by Sonage and then Terry
[2921.56 - 2926.44] P:1489.67 E:0.057211 |  misunderstands what Johnson's intention was and plays the ball ahead of the full back out for a
[2926.44 - 2931.24] P:1374.62 E:0.058020 |  throw into Andorra. Holland have already qualified, haven't they? Yes, they have, by winning against
[2931.24 - 2937.64] P:1452.46 E:0.051653 |  Iceland at the weekend. I think Spain have also got maximum points in a European group as well.
[2938.28 - 2941.88] P:1498.15 E:0.059552 |  But, you know, that's quite an accomplishment, isn't it? You know, in England they've played,
[2941.88 - 2947.80] P:1599.41 E:0.058439 |  you know, Ukraine and Croatia, good side, Ukraine won earlier, by the way, they beat Kazakhstan
[2947.80 - 2952.76] P:1681.47 E:0.067297 |  2-1 and Macedonia beat Iceland 2-0 in a Lutson-Scotland group, as is the Dutch game.
[2954.12 - 2958.44] P:1467.31 E:0.059952 |  Throw into Andorra on the halfway line, the game sort of quietened down nice as the crowd.
[2959.72 - 2963.80] P:1550.83 E:0.056370 |  It's just a recognition that Andorra are painfully limited.
[2965.56 - 2968.52] P:1642.41 E:0.059762 |  Chamber, they left full back, just over the halfway line,
[2969.24 - 2973.80] P:1862.13 E:0.068761 |  hesitates to throw, finally throws towards Silver, it's headed away by Johnson,
[2973.80 - 2977.80] P:1699.29 E:0.058818 |  Chamber heads it forward again straight out of play. Well, what a waste of time that was.
[2978.52 - 2981.40] P:1785.04 E:0.070720 |  He could have just thrown the ball initially doing and kept the game moving.
[2982.84 - 2986.84] P:1639.79 E:0.062687 |  Johnson throw into back up and on Nijtijera, left of the centre, Seracol.
[2986.84 - 2992.12] P:1644.70 E:0.056636 |  Lampard close by, but it's played to the left side and Ashley Cole. Cole back to Lampard,
[2992.12 - 2995.96] P:1705.41 E:0.058157 |  Jared in a forward position. Lampard plays it to the right, to Johnson.
[2995.96 - 2999.72] P:1705.86 E:0.056734 |  Walcott's further down that touch line, gets to the ball now, is tackled by
[2999.72 - 3004.52] P:1523.49 E:0.062454 |  Chamber and it breaks out for an England throw in, midway inside the Andorra half.
[3005.56 - 3009.40] P:1663.82 E:0.075173 |  England two, Andorra 0, you've just seen the five live on the BBC and later tonight,
[3009.40 - 3013.32] P:1586.64 E:0.060237 |  by the way, when the game finishes, and in about an hour and 10 minutes time,
[3013.32 - 3016.68] P:1760.65 E:0.069612 |  I'll be presenting 6-0, 6 the lines will be opening in 10 minutes.
[3017.40 - 3021.24] P:1689.93 E:0.074983 |  The number you wish to call is 0-500-909-693.
[3022.52 - 3025.96] P:1285.09 E:0.070829 |  Johnson with a throw into Walcott, what remark are you going to make?
[3025.96 - 3027.48] P:1538.79 E:0.072243 |  Now what would you call up and say though?
[3028.36 - 3033.88] P:1455.48 E:0.062915 |  Weren't Andorra great? Weren't England brilliant and Beckham should be in the starting team,
[3034.52 - 3036.92] P:1525.34 E:0.068446 |  starting line up every game. They're just trying to provoke me.
[3037.88 - 3045.24] P:1404.33 E:0.059546 |  Gerard back to Lescott, to Gerard again, inside left channel for England and moving in field.
[3045.24 - 3048.60] P:1649.43 E:0.073473 |  Gerard wants some movement further forward, there wasn't a great deal so he plays it
[3048.60 - 3052.36] P:1667.25 E:0.063712 |  to Johnson, good control by Johnson, level edge of the penalty, back to Beckham,
[3052.44 - 3057.72] P:1645.24 E:0.061110 |  early cross in by Beckham, Crutch jump, missed time to jump, and it's cleared by Andorra,
[3057.72 - 3062.76] P:1419.00 E:0.062097 |  and they want to start a fight here. I mean Crutch went to beat the ball, collided with
[3062.76 - 3067.24] P:1788.45 E:0.073229 |  the defender, I think Tony Lima. No, Lima's the one, the six, yeah, sorry.
[3067.24 - 3072.52] P:1671.81 E:0.061683 |  Yeah, it was complaining. Yeah, Ildefan's Lima went in for a Barney, waste of time.
[3073.64 - 3077.24] P:1518.27 E:0.061617 |  Lampard for England, referee saw nothing wrong, and there was nothing wrong.
[3077.24 - 3080.52] P:1852.31 E:0.077585 |  Low cross in, Rudy scored the third goal, brilliant the other half,
[3080.52 - 3083.88] P:1516.77 E:0.078221 |  Bolly, and Rudy now has equal Gary Linnicka's record,
[3086.28 - 3089.80] P:1521.68 E:0.078638 |  really is equal Gary Linnicka's record in terms of the number of international
[3089.80 - 3093.24] P:1641.59 E:0.078242 |  gold scored in the season. What are you saying Mark? Yet another cross from Glenn Johnson,
[3093.24 - 3099.08] P:1741.03 E:0.062885 |  and a great cross that it was certainly. Just picked him out, one touch, control,
[3099.08 - 3103.96] P:1755.95 E:0.063146 |  low, flicked it in, definitely not offside, great finish. Good, good, good finish from Wayne
[3103.96 - 3106.60] P:1542.11 E:0.075056 |  Rudy. Can Phil as Boots here tonight? Yeah. How many goals does he want?
[3107.72 - 3110.60] P:1501.61 E:0.066747 |  Actually, he's been quite quiet between the two goals, you know.
[3111.40 - 3117.72] P:1369.07 E:0.056453 |  Must be so bad that, mustn't he? No, well done, Wayne Rudy. Well, it's that 24 for England tonight.
[3118.76 - 3123.40] P:1230.95 E:0.069433 |  You remember all that time we went with Gary thinking, we knew, is he going to get to Bobby
[3123.40 - 3127.64] P:1380.02 E:0.057997 |  Charlton's record? He never quite made it. Wayne Rudy's definitely going to become
[3127.64 - 3132.84] P:1346.87 E:0.063139 |  England's leading goal scorer of all time. Barring a series injury, and please don't let that happen.
[3134.52 - 3140.04] P:1646.38 E:0.060858 |  Three shots and target two goals. Not bad. England three and Doronil, six minutes to go to half time.
[3140.04 - 3145.64] P:1597.90 E:0.056587 |  No, five shots, three on target, two goals. I thought I said three shots on target, anyway.
[3146.36 - 3153.16] P:1564.95 E:0.056143 |  Whatever I said. And England could actually, you know, Graham mentioned it earlier, what he said
[3153.16 - 3158.52] P:1556.74 E:0.060008 |  could easily be double-figure here tonight. The record defeats were 8-1 by the Czech Republic,
[3158.52 - 3165.08] P:1477.10 E:0.065985 |  and 7-0 by Croatia, both in 2005. Norris has said to me he's equal Tommy Taylor's record as well.
[3165.08 - 3170.04] P:1584.94 E:0.065924 |  As he mentioned, everybody gave Tommy Taylor played in group matches. I think, you know,
[3170.04 - 3174.04] P:1815.02 E:0.070291 |  Wayne Rudy's had a few more opportunities. England three-kick, taking 20. No, no, no, no, no, it's not.
[3174.04 - 3181.48] P:1667.69 E:0.054882 |  He's taking it back. He's getting one of their players being booked. 11. Andorra. Andorra has been
[3181.48 - 3188.44] P:1787.18 E:0.045142 |  booked for blocking Geron off. Right, okay. Well, it'll be the first of a few, you think.
[3189.40 - 3196.84] P:1757.45 E:0.056501 |  Three-kick to England, eights Beckham territory. It's around about 25 yards from goal to the left,
[3197.48 - 3204.44] P:1827.04 E:0.051925 |  as England are playing. And so, Mr. Caldo, watch out. Beckham has placed the ball,
[3204.44 - 3208.60] P:1690.37 E:0.057112 |  lampars nearby, but surely it will be David Beckham's right foot that delivers.
[3209.56 - 3213.08] P:1698.28 E:0.059933 |  It's a sort of sideways run up by the former England captain.
[3214.60 - 3220.36] P:1684.84 E:0.058364 |  A Mexican wave around Wembley. England three-hand, Doher now. Beckham three-kick to come.
[3220.36 - 3224.68] P:1655.91 E:0.067404 |  There it goes. Right footed in towards the near post, and the goalkeeper got down well and gathered
[3224.68 - 3231.40] P:1786.40 E:0.052210 |  it very easily. And Mike, who's been sitting up all night, I know he has to get ready for this game.
[3231.96 - 3237.24] P:1745.45 E:0.067438 |  He's now in level with Jeff Terst, Wayne Rudy, 24 goals. It's not Mike, it's Norris as in McWhorter.
[3239.32 - 3246.36] P:1860.85 E:0.053096 |  Here's Peter Crouch, who despite his tiring build, is actually not that great in the air,
[3246.36 - 3250.84] P:1617.26 E:0.069379 |  and he loses out there. And Andorra hit it upfield, and is that Robert Green's third touch of the ball?
[3251.80 - 3255.56] P:1610.31 E:0.064319 |  Boy, he's getting spoiled here. Whose record does that equal, though? Does Mike know that?
[3257.08 - 3261.96] P:1518.14 E:0.064663 |  Ashley Caldo on the left side was the target for lampars pass, but it was intercepted by Ayala,
[3261.96 - 3267.96] P:1628.06 E:0.052881 |  and it's out of play for a throw in to England. Left side, Ashley Caldo takes it. Back to Gerard.
[3268.84 - 3273.48] P:1635.13 E:0.053990 |  And now in to Beckham. Beckham on the edge of the centre circle. Onto Glen Johnson.
[3273.48 - 3277.64] P:1770.75 E:0.061629 |  Who you're right, certainly he's a hat, no defending to do, but an attacking sense has played really
[3277.64 - 3284.68] P:1844.07 E:0.059541 |  well tonight. His crossfield ball to Lescon, on to Ashley Cole again, into Gerard, to Rune. To Gerard.
[3284.68 - 3289.56] P:1775.06 E:0.059652 |  Gerard, not quite enough room for the shot, evaded a foul challenge by Sonagy, and then he gave the
[3289.56 - 3294.28] P:1745.74 E:0.061312 |  ball away, and it should be cleared by Andorra. Well, at least it's run away from the penalty
[3294.44 - 3298.36] P:1744.56 E:0.056976 |  here by Jimenez, and then it's left for Beckham to take up England possession again.
[3298.36 - 3302.36] P:1781.28 E:0.066942 |  Alan Silvio, the lone striker, is 25 yards in his own half.
[3303.40 - 3307.80] P:1790.95 E:0.069769 |  Ridiculous. At least he's made a challenge, a winning challenge on Gerard. Then Gerard
[3307.80 - 3313.56] P:1713.34 E:0.058760 |  wins the ball back, and here's Andorra holding off Rune, and that's with Ayala, who's brave enough
[3313.56 - 3317.16] P:1687.92 E:0.064080 |  to wear those orange boots, and he just belts it up over the half way like straight through to
[3317.16 - 3323.08] P:1649.53 E:0.055752 |  Robert Green, fourth touch for the West Ham goalkeeper. And the Mexican Wave continues,
[3323.08 - 3326.28] P:1489.15 E:0.065971 |  unfortunately, to indicate that the crowd are just getting a little bit bored.
[3327.48 - 3331.88] P:1680.28 E:0.066340 |  England three, and Andorra nil. That's frankly, it's good a position the first half as I would
[3331.88 - 3336.12] P:1559.05 E:0.060424 |  have anticipated. Quite pleased with the way England are playing. Lampard, excellent ball
[3336.12 - 3341.00] P:1784.01 E:0.063893 |  to Ashley Cole. Left edge of the penalty here. Cole's cross too deep, surely, but it comes back
[3341.00 - 3346.44] P:1461.82 E:0.052942 |  off an offender. The defender was Jimenez, and it's behind for a corner to England.
[3346.44 - 3350.36] P:1547.21 E:0.072840 |  I just thought a little bit earlier speed of thought and movement from Walcott. He might have
[3350.36 - 3354.76] P:1305.94 E:0.058614 |  gotten on the end of that. He was waiting for it rather than attacking it. Beckham,
[3354.76 - 3359.88] P:1467.63 E:0.060413 |  to take the corner from the right hand side. Lescott made the run to the near post. Beckham
[3360.76 - 3365.40] P:1517.23 E:0.069346 |  decided to replace the ball inside the quadrant. Beckham, no. Deliberately plays it outside of
[3365.40 - 3370.60] P:1312.10 E:0.055762 |  the penalty, and she had a walk on. Onto Lampard, the pass from Walcott, not really firm enough.
[3370.60 - 3375.56] P:1683.22 E:0.059666 |  Half intercepted. Oh, there's some pushing going on, but we're yielded points, Lima and Crouch.
[3376.12 - 3379.96] P:1710.52 E:0.069718 |  Look, they're always wanting to start a fight. The game hasn't stopped. England's still on the attack.
[3379.96 - 3385.56] P:1670.48 E:0.061578 |  Lescott in towards Crouch, intercepted by Lima, and neither shouting at Lescott.
[3386.20 - 3390.52] P:1625.04 E:0.074831 |  The defenders, because there was an Andorran player down. I'm not sure that he's injured.
[3390.52 - 3394.76] P:1659.68 E:0.080808 |  Alisson, the other thing is anyway, it's a referee to stop the game.
[3397.56 - 3400.52] P:1700.75 E:0.073936 |  Tell that, oh good, Cole has been put for the second match in succession
[3401.16 - 3406.84] P:1732.32 E:0.063378 |  for protesting the captain. The attendance, by the way, is much better than we thought. 57,897.
[3406.84 - 3414.28] P:1598.52 E:0.047765 |  Do you believe that? I don't know. Would I ever say that the people who
[3414.28 - 3417.32] P:1489.26 E:0.058908 |  count the crowd at Wembley got it wrong deliberately? I'd say, well,
[3417.32 - 3421.08] P:1737.64 E:0.061551 |  ask Norris to count them in the second half, but I don't think it's 57,000 in here.
[3422.36 - 3425.16] P:1613.20 E:0.062751 |  All right, calm down, Andorra, calm down.
[3427.16 - 3433.72] P:1526.96 E:0.057405 |  One minute left in the first half. England 3, Andorran L. Beckham with a corner from the left
[3433.72 - 3440.04] P:1678.59 E:0.057982 |  side, right footed, deep towards the far post, and Crouch in the face. There was an appeal,
[3440.04 - 3444.12] P:1657.81 E:0.068978 |  I think, by John Terry. It was a hand that hit Crouch in the face, and Andorra run the ball
[3444.12 - 3448.76] P:1274.60 E:0.050572 |  into the England half, and I had to play for a throw-in. I think it's a ball, Alan.
[3449.40 - 3453.40] P:1538.55 E:0.062502 |  The ball hit him in the face. I think it did. Just watching if there was a hand as well.
[3454.52 - 3457.72] P:1718.52 E:0.074676 |  Ball first, then, and it just came across. And Alisson's Lima tried to make sure he hit him,
[3457.72 - 3462.12] P:1707.54 E:0.053387 |  and he stood on him as well, just for goodness sake. Well, just, you know, why not? Here's Beckham
[3463.08 - 3469.56] P:1586.99 E:0.059079 |  to Lampard. I think you and Graham were wondering before the game, you know, the danger of injury
[3469.56 - 3474.04] P:1650.57 E:0.067842 |  with the approach, this obviously abrasive approach of Andorra, and it's still there.
[3474.04 - 3476.20] P:1680.81 E:0.065630 |  Yeah, it's because they don't know how to kick you properly.
[3476.84 - 3483.00] P:1723.82 E:0.059287 |  Beckham, glorious crossfield ball. Excellent control by Johnson. Johnson in, on his left foot,
[3483.00 - 3488.04] P:1533.44 E:0.054732 |  tries to shoot for Glory, and Belton high in the crowd after he was tackled as well.
[3488.04 - 3493.40] P:1651.27 E:0.070459 |  Wasn't great, as I said before, what he does do, Johnson, it comes inside all the time,
[3493.40 - 3497.24] P:1517.23 E:0.058957 |  and he does open out the angles for himself, obviously. It's occasionally not particularly
[3497.24 - 3502.92] P:1790.89 E:0.067416 |  well-structured. Great ball that he's shown on the TV here again. I just missed the fourth official,
[3502.92 - 3506.76] P:1452.90 E:0.058761 |  by the way, I think it's a minute. Can only be a minute of added time, surely. And we're
[3506.76 - 3511.00] P:1623.49 E:0.065149 |  into added time at the end of the first half. It's really satisfactory. England three,
[3511.00 - 3516.76] P:1542.06 E:0.054020 |  Andorra nil, two goals from Rune, one from Lampard. Rune with the first and the third.
[3517.48 - 3522.36] P:1653.90 E:0.060139 |  Good header by Terry, but then the ball is now with Marina on the halfway line,
[3522.36 - 3527.56] P:1716.82 E:0.053540 |  and they're inside the England half, and now they play it back to Ayala, the full back.
[3527.56 - 3533.48] P:1622.15 E:0.059118 |  He almost gave it away, collected by Andorra though, and now Marina again to Ayala, where
[3533.48 - 3539.00] P:1687.92 E:0.049496 |  are they going? Nowhere. Ashley Cole collects possession for Ringe, and finds John Terry,
[3539.56 - 3544.04] P:1614.23 E:0.056059 |  and on it goes to Glenn Johnson on the far side of the field, right of the centre circle,
[3544.04 - 3548.44] P:1673.56 E:0.063302 |  onto Walcott. There's the halftime whistle from the referee, and John's already done,
[3548.44 - 3551.32] P:1635.58 E:0.072555 |  I think they're playing quite well. Yeah, they are playing well in England, just a little spell
[3551.32 - 3555.64] P:1597.03 E:0.071578 |  after the first goal in between the first and the second, where they started to go a little bit
[3555.64 - 3560.04] P:1473.65 E:0.071631 |  sort of long ball, but generally after that, the composition, the way they've made the goals and
[3560.04 - 3564.76] P:1455.81 E:0.066383 |  taken them is very, very good indeed. You do have to say, and we're harking on about it, Andorra
[3564.76 - 3571.72] P:1584.01 E:0.059354 |  are hopeless. The lines are open now for 606, 05, 109, 9, 6, 9, 3. I'll be on the air between the
[3571.72 - 3576.04] P:1574.16 E:0.053503 |  conclusion of this programme and 11 o'clock, so do keep me company tonight. Last opportunity of the
[3576.04 - 3580.60] P:1698.58 E:0.062343 |  season for you to get your calls in. England have got their calls in in the first half, England 3
[3580.60 - 3585.72] P:1988.64 E:0.055541 |  and Andorra Nill. Graham Taylor, what do you say about that? It's very much the same, isn't it?
[3585.72 - 3589.96] P:2012.66 E:0.069652 |  They're doing the job, they're doing what the manager's asked of them. He was caught as saying,
[3589.96 - 3595.32] P:2046.81 E:0.061541 |  an early goal will make the game easy. That's exactly what they've done. Lovely goal, the third
[3595.32 - 3600.20] P:2135.05 E:0.081254 |  one. What a sweet finish that was from a man really in form, really. You have to say this as
[3600.20 - 3605.00] P:2087.90 E:0.073033 |  well, irrespective of the opposition. If you look, he does a great little turn off his defender,
[3605.00 - 3608.76] P:2132.84 E:0.066438 |  and his finish is immaculate. It doesn't matter about the opposition, that's a very, very good
[3608.76 - 3612.52] P:2124.13 E:0.076314 |  goal. I think if I were coming here today as a spectator, I would be as excited about what's
[3612.52 - 3616.68] P:2172.45 E:0.076201 |  going to happen at halftime as I was about the match. And that is those from 1966 who didn't play
[3616.68 - 3620.84] P:2180.39 E:0.065290 |  in the final have got their medals today from Downing Street, and they'll be on the pitch at
[3620.84 - 3624.20] P:2155.36 E:0.072850 |  halftime. I hope they turn the sprinklers off for Jimmy Armfield and the rest. I don't want his best
[3624.20 - 3631.08] P:2163.35 E:0.079664 |  suit ruined. Well, Jimmy Armfield and Peter Bonetti and those who didn't play in the final in 1966
[3631.08 - 3634.76] P:2097.21 E:0.073950 |  are being applauded onto the pitch here at Wembley. We'll hear from them in a moment after Kevin
[3634.76 - 3640.44] P:2114.15 E:0.073420 |  House can tell us about India beating Ireland in the world 2020 at Trent Bridge tonight. That's right,
[3640.44 - 3644.76] P:2101.54 E:0.093850 |  both teams are ready through, of course. The target was just 113. India's victory by eight wickets,
[3644.76 - 3649.64] P:2207.11 E:0.081435 |  15 balls remaining. Rohit Sharman not out half-century. The night proving what many would
[3649.64 - 3654.84] P:2062.43 E:0.070155 |  expect a tough one for Ireland. Now, Keemann, Nylo Bryan and Trent Johnson were both expected to
[3654.84 - 3659.48] P:2120.65 E:0.073114 |  be fit to face New Zealand tomorrow in the Super 8. It was a struggle, but not one which will
[3659.48 - 3663.56] P:2034.54 E:0.077892 |  dangerously destroy confidence, I don't think. India's Zaheer Khan blowing away their batting
[3663.56 - 3668.68] P:2169.80 E:0.071415 |  with four wickets. Gary Wilson and John Mooney keeping the dignity after crashing to 28 for four
[3668.68 - 3674.04] P:2095.56 E:0.066343 |  in seven overs. The former county player Andrew White was Khan's final wicket, compiling 29,
[3674.04 - 3679.00] P:2275.69 E:0.070196 |  including three fours and one six, reduced to 18 overs beside due to some rain in Iran.
[3679.00 - 3684.76] P:2046.52 E:0.070018 |  They totaled 112 for eight. India, even without Seawag, appear very capable of defending their
[3684.76 - 3690.04] P:2019.57 E:0.077238 |  title. They face England, the West Indies and South Africa in the next stage. Also looking good,
[3690.04 - 3695.40] P:2046.68 E:0.074255 |  Arshra Lanka, who beat earlier today the West Indies by 15 runs. One other piece of news regarding
[3695.40 - 3700.12] P:2104.92 E:0.082518 |  New Zealand this evening. It sounds if their opener, Jesse Ryder, is feeling very unwell.
[3700.12 - 3704.68] P:2098.53 E:0.070959 |  He's remained in London instead of traveling to Nottingham under observation in hospital.
[3704.68 - 3710.04] P:2060.47 E:0.075094 |  Their team manager says that Jesse's injury is unclear, suffering from a significant infection
[3710.04 - 3715.16] P:2115.24 E:0.063909 |  and he certainly won't be able to play tomorrow against the Irish. Thank you very much indeed.
[3715.16 - 3719.96] P:2189.66 E:0.078406 |  It's fair to say Graham Taylor, the biggest cheer for those who didn't play in the final,
[3719.96 - 3724.92] P:2218.18 E:0.077589 |  is for the man. I really, this is the one man I wish I'd seen playing, Jimmy Greaves.
[3724.92 - 3729.88] P:2059.12 E:0.077616 |  Well, you know, people talk about how many goals you've scored for England and they put,
[3729.88 - 3736.28] P:2102.20 E:0.080416 |  in relation to the games you play and the goals that you scored, along with Nat Loftaus,
[3736.28 - 3743.72] P:2099.78 E:0.074176 |  he's the top man. I mean, look, anything in the box, Jimmy's going to put it in the net for you.
[3743.72 - 3749.24] P:2092.52 E:0.074587 |  It was a fantastic finisher, an excellent player. And of course, Jimmy Greaves, who played in the
[3749.24 - 3754.84] P:2219.01 E:0.076830 |  group games, didn't he? Then got an injury, he got a gash in his shin, then was fit for the final,
[3755.08 - 3759.24] P:2121.90 E:0.072007 |  but Sir Al Framsi decided not to change his forward line of Roger Hunt and Jeff Hurst.
[3759.24 - 3764.12] P:2090.57 E:0.075814 |  And Al Framsi was proved completely right, of course, but it must have been and it was very,
[3764.12 - 3768.92] P:2070.99 E:0.072640 |  very difficult for the most, arguably the most natural goal scorer England has ever had.
[3768.92 - 3774.44] P:1957.14 E:0.063703 |  And I don't care who you are, you know, it's got to hurt at that time. And of course,
[3774.44 - 3778.76] P:1929.78 E:0.071575 |  it should, you know what I mean? You can't suddenly turn around and say, well, I don't really mind,
[3778.76 - 3783.00] P:1978.14 E:0.082695 |  but it's so good to see them all. I mean, names, I've been a professional footballer for years
[3783.56 - 3788.76] P:2098.51 E:0.069505 |  at this stage in 66. So all of these names are at the prime, they're at the height,
[3788.76 - 3792.84] P:2052.10 E:0.076913 |  everything that you are looking for. And in many respects, wanting to be yourself.
[3792.84 - 3796.12] P:2277.74 E:0.077642 |  Let me just run through the names. So these are those who didn't play in the final and they
[3796.12 - 3801.00] P:2251.19 E:0.075008 |  have at last 43 years later got their medal. Of course, very soon after that, all those in
[3801.00 - 3806.52] P:2167.33 E:0.073745 |  the squad did get a medal. Jimmy Greaves, John Cannelly, Ron Springett, Peter Bonetti, Jimmy
[3806.52 - 3812.76] P:2121.23 E:0.066971 |  Armfield, Jerry Byrne, Ron Flowers, Norman Hunter in Callaghan, George Easton and Terry Payne.
[3812.76 - 3816.20] P:2167.26 E:0.079721 |  Some of those particularly players like Cannelly and Payne played in earlier games,
[3816.20 - 3820.60] P:2152.13 E:0.073414 |  didn't they? When Alprams, he started with wingers and in the end it evolved for one reason
[3820.60 - 3825.64] P:2127.13 E:0.075339 |  and another into Martin Peters and Allen Ball. But some did play early on and some like our own
[3825.64 - 3829.72] P:1932.95 E:0.083370 |  Jimmy didn't play at all in that tournament. No, they didn't. I mean, Jimmy was coming up,
[3829.72 - 3834.20] P:2040.65 E:0.079639 |  leading up to it. I don't know whether he lost his place through injury or what, but George Cohen
[3834.20 - 3839.96] P:2115.85 E:0.073244 |  took over and held his place. Yes, Jimmy was injured just before the World Cup. He broke his
[3839.96 - 3844.36] P:2083.06 E:0.079021 |  metatarsal before it had even been invented. They wouldn't know what that was in those days.
[3844.36 - 3849.32] P:2202.22 E:0.076751 |  I can see him down there with David Oates. So I'm just about to get the signal. I've got the
[3849.32 - 3855.80] P:1982.13 E:0.080010 |  signal. Here he is, Jimmy Armfield with David. Well, Jimmy, 43 years. It's been a long wait. Has
[3855.80 - 3862.84] P:1757.24 E:0.065755 |  it been worth the wait? Well, I must be honest, at the time, we never thought about getting medals,
[3862.84 - 3867.88] P:1842.84 E:0.079001 |  to be honest. We thought, well, we would just satisfy the team we'd won. We all wanted to play,
[3867.88 - 3873.40] P:1751.73 E:0.062449 |  of course. But the simple truth is that now it's come. It's really good, I think. I've enjoyed
[3873.40 - 3878.28] P:2019.47 E:0.070832 |  the day. I think all of us have enjoyed seeing each other again over the last three or four days.
[3879.00 - 3884.68] P:1742.08 E:0.066713 |  I think that's been really terrific. And now I've got the medal. Yes, I think it's a really super
[3884.68 - 3889.80] P:1870.79 E:0.078774 |  day. It's funny because it would be unthinkable now, really, for anybody in the squad not to get
[3890.44 - 3895.88] P:2000.05 E:0.074095 |  a medal. Life was a bit harsher like that in those days. If you didn't actually play and
[3895.88 - 3900.84] P:1904.33 E:0.073681 |  played in the earlier rounds, it made no difference. You still get it. And we accepted that was the
[3900.84 - 3905.40] P:1718.70 E:0.070742 |  way it was. I think it was as simple as that. Jimmy Graves is here as well. Jimmy, obviously,
[3905.40 - 3909.96] P:1696.36 E:0.070590 |  you were fit for the final, but missed out in a place. Does this go some way to making up for that?
[3909.96 - 3915.48] P:1913.76 E:0.067149 |  Not really. It's just a lovely day out. We've had a good time. I've seen London by coach.
[3916.20 - 3924.12] P:1854.70 E:0.064040 |  I've had a wonderful police escort, which took us all around London, got here. It's a great stadium.
[3924.68 - 3930.28] P:1974.32 E:0.076077 |  It's great to see the lads again. I wouldn't say that we haven't seen each other for a long time,
[3930.28 - 3937.16] P:1788.92 E:0.066734 |  because we do see each other. But they're all together. Georgie Coins here, representing Sir
[3937.16 - 3943.72] P:1953.69 E:0.058344 |  Alph as well. And it's been a really, really pleasant day. It's a shame about the game, but
[3944.20 - 3948.76] P:1867.23 E:0.062734 |  that's how it goes. Well, you can only beat what's put in front of you. As you say, George,
[3948.76 - 3953.40] P:1742.40 E:0.073978 |  representing Sir Alph. Obviously, a bit of a shame that Sir Alph isn't here to accept this
[3953.40 - 3960.84] P:1871.76 E:0.078445 |  himself. Wally has been nearly 100 years old. It's a privilege and I'm very proud to represent Lady
[3960.84 - 3970.36] P:2008.38 E:0.071991 |  Ramsey. And I feel she cannot be here because she's advanced in age. But she asked me to
[3970.36 - 3973.40] P:1921.47 E:0.067320 |  represent Alph. And I'm happy, very proud to have done so.
[3973.40 - 3979.32] P:1751.23 E:0.083417 |  This seems to be a terrific camaraderie between all the squad members. You do seem to get on.
[3979.32 - 3984.12] P:1965.18 E:0.081782 |  Oh, yes, sir. We have reunions every year. It's a wonderful affair. Even the wives get on, you know.
[3984.12 - 3991.48] P:1753.09 E:0.070525 |  So, but this is the good thing. We've stayed friends for many, many years. Because when we've
[3991.48 - 3997.00] P:1858.87 E:0.070271 |  met each other, we go home north, east, south and west. But it's always been a very, very good,
[3997.00 - 4002.76] P:1825.47 E:0.058263 |  close knit unit. And that's how Sir Alph would have liked it. Thanks, George. And Jimmy, I feel
[4002.76 - 4008.60] P:1868.22 E:0.067909 |  just that last word for you. I couldn't leave five live without showing you my medal. The listeners
[4008.60 - 4013.96] P:1906.45 E:0.065049 |  can't see it. You can describe what it says. Well, it's to go that far across about an inch and a
[4013.96 - 4018.68] P:1862.33 E:0.070877 |  half for the Jules Remaid trophy on one side. I'll let you read what it says on the other.
[4018.68 - 4025.88] P:1795.66 E:0.056669 |  Oh dear. Now you're asking. England 1966 World Championship, the Jules Remaid Cup.
[4026.36 - 4030.92] P:1622.19 E:0.058682 |  England. Brighter place. The Engfield trophy cabinet. Of course. Thank you very much.
[4032.52 - 4037.56] P:2023.45 E:0.080541 |  It's back in Jimmy's pocket. I can see it already before David Hoates gets too close to it.
[4037.56 - 4042.44] P:1960.36 E:0.081317 |  Jimmy Groves hasn't lost his sense of humour, has he? Well, he hasn't. But what he is, he's been
[4042.44 - 4047.16] P:2095.43 E:0.071203 |  honest with everybody and he shows his hurt. Because you must be, when you think about it,
[4047.16 - 4052.36] P:2070.22 E:0.068068 |  how he must have felt at that particular time. And yes, as the years go on, it probably gets
[4052.36 - 4058.12] P:2097.18 E:0.061857 |  less and less. But what I liked about Jimmy there, honestly, he wasn't going to, that's, yeah,
[4058.12 - 4063.56] P:2043.37 E:0.076633 |  it doesn't really make him for it because his view would be probably one of the most disappointing
[4063.56 - 4070.60] P:2054.75 E:0.068983 |  times of his life was not to get in that far. But life goes on and he's done fantastically well as
[4070.60 - 4075.08] P:2163.57 E:0.078425 |  Jimmy. I always think the irony about Jimmy Greaves and the World Cup final is that in 1970, so the
[4075.08 - 4080.36] P:2160.88 E:0.075113 |  next World Cup, there were substitutes. Because there were no substitutes in 1966. And I said this
[4080.36 - 4085.32] P:2038.90 E:0.071623 |  to Jimmy on field the other day, just think about this, had the final been in 1970, he'd have come
[4085.32 - 4089.08] P:2105.76 E:0.087433 |  off the bench, wouldn't he? Can you imagine 2-2, you'd have got Jimmy Greaves straight off the bench,
[4089.08 - 4094.12] P:1990.77 E:0.072304 |  wouldn't you? How unlucky the timing of it all. It's all about timing in everything, isn't it?
[4095.72 - 4100.20] P:2128.72 E:0.075790 |  Mark Lawrenson, wonderful to see these players rewarded so. Yeah, but I have to say Mark,
[4100.20 - 4105.80] P:1913.58 E:0.067728 |  I thought they should have got the medals here before this crowd, before the game. It's nothing
[4105.80 - 4110.68] P:1976.84 E:0.071782 |  to do with the Prime Minister and Downing Street. This is all about England footballers who,
[4110.68 - 4114.68] P:1959.90 E:0.075582 |  unfortunately, they were in the 22, they didn't quite obviously make it onto the pitch. They should
[4114.68 - 4119.00] P:1918.15 E:0.071882 |  have been here tonight getting the medals before the game in front of this Wembley crowd and
[4119.00 - 4123.56] P:1945.31 E:0.065849 |  in front of proper football supporters, and that would really have put the gloss on the situation.
[4124.20 - 4128.92] P:2130.11 E:0.080426 |  I agree, but I suppose the fact that it's half empty in a way that we've saved ourselves. I think it
[4128.92 - 4133.16] P:2265.62 E:0.085394 |  would have been 80, 90,000, absolutely heaving. I'm with you all the way and I'm sure a lot of people
[4133.16 - 4137.88] P:1932.73 E:0.067264 |  know that when it was all arranged. We weren't to know that it was going to be a tube strike, so
[4137.88 - 4144.28] P:2019.69 E:0.070451 |  there you go. It's a life we live in, I'm afraid. Which of those players would you pick out that
[4144.28 - 4149.40] P:1981.97 E:0.077520 |  you remember particularly as you were growing up, Mark? I can remember every single one. I mean,
[4149.40 - 4153.32] P:1879.41 E:0.077941 |  look at George Easton there. I mean, the players in the dressing room now below, just below us,
[4153.32 - 4157.88] P:1836.18 E:0.072688 |  how thankful would they be to George Easton because of the fantastic money that they're earning? But
[4157.96 - 4163.08] P:1896.36 E:0.068750 |  I mean, it was inevitable as well that Greavesy would get the best and the biggest
[4163.08 - 4167.56] P:1935.34 E:0.068507 |  salvation. I thought he was just an absolute sensational football. But Jimmy, of course,
[4167.56 - 4172.84] P:1848.93 E:0.063337 |  one of our friends here on Five Live, one of the very first, if not the first, attacking fullbacks.
[4172.84 - 4178.28] P:1911.35 E:0.061371 |  He was an outstanding player and Jimmy's given so much back to the game. But all those players,
[4178.28 - 4183.00] P:1911.63 E:0.073434 |  Norman Hunter, a nicer bloke you couldn't wish to meet, but he would have sold his granny for a
[4183.00 - 4186.84] P:2023.73 E:0.074671 |  quid on the pitch. And that's the way those players were. Nice to meet you, unless you had the ball,
[4186.84 - 4194.92] P:1984.16 E:0.064464 |  Mark. Absolutely. Man, you don't mention Paul then to him. 1973, of course. Jimmy says he was the
[4194.92 - 4199.72] P:2102.42 E:0.071929 |  first overlapping fullback. I asked him, I said, were you, he said, yes, I was the first overlapping
[4199.72 - 4206.12] P:2028.18 E:0.068450 |  fullback. I can believe that he was. I actually saw Jimmy play for Blackpool. He must have been
[4206.12 - 4211.40] P:1994.21 E:0.075117 |  right at the end of his career. I don't know, it was 70 or 71, when they lost at home to Arsenal,
[4211.40 - 4216.84] P:1992.81 E:0.069046 |  actually went on to do the double that day. And even then, he was still very much of that attacking
[4216.84 - 4221.88] P:2076.12 E:0.074431 |  right back mould. It's interesting now, television interviewing Jimmy Greaves, inevitably he is
[4221.88 - 4228.12] P:2117.43 E:0.072122 |  the focus of attention. 57 caps, 44 goals, Graham. That just brings to mind what you were saying in
[4228.12 - 4231.96] P:2058.14 E:0.077440 |  terms of the ratio, this wonderful word ratio. That's how I think, you know, if you turn right,
[4231.96 - 4237.40] P:2086.81 E:0.067927 |  yes, of course, you say you've scored the most goals, but in terms of games and goals scored,
[4237.40 - 4243.00] P:1968.29 E:0.064432 |  then you look. I mean, I think Loft House is something like about 28 in 31, do you know what
[4243.00 - 4247.72] P:2022.13 E:0.079392 |  I mean? But Jimmy is right up there at the very, very top. And of course, he won his England place
[4247.72 - 4251.08] P:2150.28 E:0.077013 |  back the year after, wasn't it? That was the end of his international career. He was back in the
[4251.08 - 4258.60] P:2034.37 E:0.066704 |  England team the year after. I think they all say the most important thing in the game is putting
[4258.60 - 4264.76] P:2116.32 E:0.073567 |  the ball in the net, and he could do that easily. Let me just tell you that the Lions thrashed the
[4264.76 - 4269.64] P:2182.48 E:0.074546 |  Sharks 39-3 in their latest tour match this evening in Durban, five tries for the Lions,
[4269.64 - 4274.12] P:2113.89 E:0.073147 |  and Andy Murray will face Spain's Guillermo Garcia Lopez in the third round of the Aegon
[4274.12 - 4279.32] P:2037.80 E:0.069521 |  Championships at Queens after thumping Andreas Seppi in straight sets. Well, England have found
[4279.32 - 4283.48] P:2041.52 E:0.067509 |  the back of the net three times in the first half, and Aura have barely been inside the England
[4283.48 - 4290.04] P:1932.11 E:0.062121 |  penalty area. Here's my kingdom. Thank you, Mark and Wayne Rooney having scored two in the first
[4290.04 - 4295.24] P:1725.09 E:0.076319 |  half, and equal that Gary Linica record of 10 in one season. Isn't going to get the opportunity to
[4295.24 - 4299.40] P:1627.82 E:0.066784 |  add to that in the second half. He's been replaced by Jermaine Defoe and another England change,
[4299.40 - 4304.68] P:1702.55 E:0.070423 |  Ashley Young has come on for Steven Gerrard. So the revised England lineup now is Green,
[4304.68 - 4312.52] P:1523.54 E:0.062553 |  Johnson, Terry Lescott and Ashley Cole, Walcott, Beckham, Lampard, Ashley Young, Defoe and Crouch.
[4312.52 - 4319.40] P:1728.43 E:0.070704 |  No changes made at all by Andorra at halftime. Their team is Caldo, Tony Lima, Ayala, Sonagy,
[4319.40 - 4327.56] P:1582.60 E:0.067637 |  Ildefont, Slimer and Schema, Merino, Andorra, Vieira, Jimenez and Silva. And you can understand
[4327.56 - 4333.16] P:1847.49 E:0.061074 |  really why Fabio Capallo is making these changes now because this game is won, and he's really
[4333.16 - 4337.64] P:1773.93 E:0.061683 |  trying to find a squad of 23 as well for the World Cup. It's not just about the 11, so it's a great
[4337.64 - 4341.64] P:1852.43 E:0.062065 |  chance for Defoe. We've got a couple of goals against Andorra in that five-nil-win at Old
[4341.64 - 4345.72] P:1923.03 E:0.062451 |  Trafford, and also a really good opportunity for Ashley Young who's had such a good season for
[4345.72 - 4350.68] P:1645.52 E:0.057134 |  Asta Villa to run at the full back over on the far side. The second half, and I really don't
[4350.68 - 4355.80] P:1823.02 E:0.057069 |  understand this, the second half is seconds old and Andorra going to make a change, and goodness
[4355.80 - 4358.76] P:1930.96 E:0.066691 |  knows why they didn't make it at halftime, but they're going to make a change in a moment,
[4359.48 - 4364.92] P:1765.42 E:0.062901 |  and while it just sort of defies logic really, as Beckham finds Theo Walcott near side the England
[4364.92 - 4369.24] P:1878.23 E:0.059928 |  right, England playing from left to right in the second half. Johnson who had such a good first
[4369.24 - 4374.20] P:1897.79 E:0.067582 |  half in an attacking form. The ball runs all the way through to Ashley Young over on the far side,
[4374.20 - 4378.04] P:1625.01 E:0.062382 |  cross shot comes in from him, and it's over. Now we're going to have a change more already,
[4378.04 - 4383.80] P:1672.44 E:0.061040 |  but I'm not quite sure why this happens. From England's point of view there, actually,
[4383.80 - 4388.52] P:1517.73 E:0.072063 |  it was a half chance for Ashley Young, came a long way and waited a long time to bring the ball down,
[4388.52 - 4392.68] P:1614.73 E:0.054759 |  just took it inside onto his right foot and failed to hit the target basically.
[4393.64 - 4397.88] P:1874.44 E:0.073237 |  Well, this is an interesting change too, because it looks like it's the end of Tony
[4397.88 - 4401.80] P:1846.89 E:0.079256 |  Lima's international career. That's what it is then, right? So he gets an ovation.
[4402.36 - 4406.92] P:1954.68 E:0.076785 |  Gets the, sure everyone here is aware of this, and he's exactly twice the age of the man who's
[4407.64 - 4413.56] P:1713.87 E:0.054850 |  coming on Val, Valets is coming on. The young 19-year-old is coming on to play,
[4413.56 - 4418.76] P:1739.70 E:0.066250 |  so that's the end of Tony Lima who doesn't even have a club actually. Now he's unattached,
[4418.76 - 4422.92] P:1622.80 E:0.072017 |  just plays international football, and he's certainly milking the moment coming off
[4422.92 - 4427.64] P:1579.19 E:0.059832 |  to be replaced now by Valets. Yeah, I think that's something, he just shook the hand of the manager
[4427.64 - 4432.76] P:1596.19 E:0.057410 |  as well, and that's exactly what that was all about. By the way, just finally on the 66 thing,
[4433.48 - 4437.96] P:1706.38 E:0.064607 |  it really has been an anomaly that the squad players and even players that played in the World
[4437.96 - 4442.28] P:1810.53 E:0.058664 |  Cup, when you think that 45 medals are cut nowadays, just think about someone like Ian
[4442.28 - 4447.08] P:1723.32 E:0.055923 |  Callaghan, for example, in that final group game against France, and more on that in a moment,
[4447.08 - 4452.76] P:1767.88 E:0.057990 |  as England build with Walcott and Defoe, Defoe on to David Beckham, 3-0 to England remember,
[4452.76 - 4456.68] P:1831.44 E:0.059450 |  Beckham keeps it in, plays it back to Johnson, Johnson across the field now,
[4456.68 - 4461.24] P:1650.00 E:0.063182 |  Les Scott's there inside the Andorra half, Andorra haven't crossed the half-way line yet in the
[4461.24 - 4465.96] P:1774.22 E:0.063096 |  second half, down the line from Ashley Cole to another Ashley, Ashley Young, Young on the ball
[4465.96 - 4471.56] P:1600.82 E:0.054495 |  for England, whips in the cross towards Crouch, headed away, and I'm not sure I'm going to get a
[4471.56 - 4476.36] P:1670.72 E:0.063389 |  moment to tell you my Ian Callaghan story, but we'll just watch the game continue once more,
[4476.36 - 4484.12] P:1654.19 E:0.058843 |  with Lampard, Lampard to Young eventually from Ashley Cole, England 3-0 and Andorra on 5-0.
[4484.12 - 4487.80] P:1798.22 E:0.065490 |  England struggling a bit in that final group game against France until Ian Callaghan
[4488.60 - 4493.40] P:1596.42 E:0.059473 |  put over a cross to the far post, which Roger Hunt managed to squeeze in, and you know,
[4493.40 - 4497.00] P:1692.06 E:0.066012 |  if England hadn't won that game, they wouldn't have played at Wembley in the quarter-final,
[4497.00 - 4500.76] P:1632.66 E:0.062721 |  and they'd have had to play Germany in the quarter-final, I think the game was at Hillsborough,
[4500.76 - 4505.88] P:1748.02 E:0.071377 |  so you know Ian Callaghan changing history really, and only today does he get his reward for that.
[4505.88 - 4510.92] P:1729.06 E:0.066858 |  England going forward to throw in the penalty area, round the challenge, angle awkward, and he's hit it wide.
[4510.92 - 4515.40] P:1823.53 E:0.071984 |  I'm not sure, actually, first things first, when the ball came to him, Mike, the defender slid in,
[4515.40 - 4518.52] P:1721.64 E:0.061038 |  if Defoe had gone down, he got a penalty, I think that's the first thing we should say.
[4518.52 - 4523.08] P:1741.76 E:0.071347 |  Secondly, then I think he changed his mind, I think he thought about trying to score,
[4523.08 - 4527.72] P:1714.25 E:0.066101 |  saw the angle was narrow, and ended up, I think almost sort of trying to cross as well, and
[4527.72 - 4530.28] P:1401.73 E:0.079061 |  basically it was neither, was it neither, one nor two there.
[4531.24 - 4535.88] P:1830.96 E:0.063328 |  Mike Lawrence, some with us here on 5-5, the crowd given is 57,000 on the night when there's a
[4535.88 - 4540.84] P:1781.28 E:0.063725 |  tube strike here, and England leading and threatening to score more here.
[4541.88 - 4546.04] P:1823.36 E:0.066430 |  I'm not sure what path of the course would be really, I suppose three in the first half and
[4546.04 - 4551.40] P:1874.74 E:0.060961 |  three in the second perhaps, 6-0 would suffice I think, but England are going to go 10 points
[4551.40 - 4556.36] P:1788.14 E:0.070284 |  clear of the group, Rooney with two first half goals, as Alan was mentioning, is now level with
[4556.36 - 4562.36] P:1651.07 E:0.067128 |  Jeff first at 24, and he's gone above tonight to great, great players, Stan Mortensen and Tommy
[4563.32 - 4567.96] P:1657.09 E:0.064407 |  Freak it to Andorra, short of the half way line, how on earth Fabio Capello can
[4569.08 - 4572.92] P:1789.50 E:0.075607 |  really gauge Robert Green tonight in the England goal, he's had to do absolutely nothing,
[4573.48 - 4579.88] P:1721.13 E:0.054363 |  and now Terry finds Ashley Cole over on the far side, back in field to Lampard who scored
[4579.88 - 4585.72] P:1726.74 E:0.055097 |  one of the England goals before the break, 3-0 they lead, Rooney two and Lampard, Lampard now,
[4585.72 - 4590.68] P:1600.67 E:0.058001 |  back again to Beckham, Beckham who hasn't scored for England since the World Cup in Germany,
[4590.68 - 4595.56] P:1804.76 E:0.059929 |  long ball to this near side, Glenn Johnson again, no problems going forward Glenn Johnson,
[4595.56 - 4599.96] P:1904.03 E:0.073485 |  it's just occasionally when he's examined by a really quality side when his defensive duties
[4599.96 - 4606.68] P:1776.49 E:0.061454 |  are examined, now Ashley Young over on the left, Ashley Cole again, 3-0 England, back again to Young,
[4606.68 - 4611.32] P:1692.86 E:0.069333 |  Young teasing the defender, moves inside, skims across in straight at the goalkeeper.
[4611.32 - 4614.20] P:1690.81 E:0.074518 |  It's funny what you say there about Glenn Johnson, didn't we used to say
[4614.20 - 4615.96] P:1569.98 E:0.068635 |  exactly the same thing about Ashley Cole?
[4615.96 - 4623.48] P:1652.52 E:0.055486 |  Yes, yes but Fabio Capello likes his defenders to defend, I think he's said that about Micah
[4623.48 - 4629.32] P:1695.07 E:0.047098 |  Richards who hasn't come through under Fabio Capello and what do you think about his defensive
[4629.32 - 4634.92] P:1723.89 E:0.060331 |  qualities? No I think it needs to be improved but I don't think it's that bad and also I think
[4634.92 - 4638.92] P:1594.95 E:0.071823 |  sometimes in international football your fullbacks have more of the ball than anybody else and it's
[4638.92 - 4642.68] P:1554.87 E:0.060841 |  very very important from England's point of view that they're on the ball all the time.
[4642.92 - 4648.28] P:1809.96 E:0.061554 |  Andorra camped inside their own penalty area, they're all back, even the striker is back now,
[4648.28 - 4655.80] P:1680.93 E:0.055052 |  Silver as well, Johnson, Johnson onto Wolcott, Wolcott, the Andorran defenders doubling up to
[4655.80 - 4660.28] P:1857.96 E:0.058039 |  try and contain Wolcott, Beckham now, clips the ball long range to the far side, the man that
[4660.28 - 4666.68] P:1858.81 E:0.057198 |  Mark was talking about, Ashley Cole is there, Cole onto Young again, Young slides the ball into Cole,
[4666.68 - 4670.20] P:1672.19 E:0.064446 |  Cole can't control it and it's a goal kick but England are threatening more goals.
[4670.20 - 4675.96] P:1635.01 E:0.067648 |  Yeah clever play Ashley and just a little bit too much loft on the pass, a flatter pass and Cole
[4675.96 - 4680.60] P:1524.71 E:0.071385 |  was in it, it's a good one too actually, both got great places to lad. They got the fixtures right
[4680.60 - 4685.08] P:1604.34 E:0.066120 |  didn't they Mark because they had to play Kazakhstan at some point and coming back from Kazakhstan of
[4685.08 - 4689.32] P:1612.06 E:0.072105 |  all the games you'd want this would be it, absolutely and I don't know who was in charge of the
[4689.32 - 4696.60] P:1703.36 E:0.057740 |  fixtures but they got its spot on. Goal kick to Andorra hanging on here, 3-0, clips by Caldo to
[4696.60 - 4701.00] P:1683.09 E:0.060537 |  the half-whiland, it's also his last international game this evening and it's left once more by
[4701.80 - 4710.04] P:1731.52 E:0.055137 |  Ildefonse Lima back again to Caldo. So England won 5-0 at Old Trafford against Andorra, 3-0
[4710.04 - 4715.32] P:1754.71 E:0.058231 |  eventually in that awful game they played in Barcelona under Steve McLaren, then 2-0 at the
[4715.32 - 4720.44] P:1725.47 E:0.061321 |  start of this international season and at the moment it's 3-0 but it surely will be more than that
[4720.44 - 4724.44] P:1589.15 E:0.068862 |  come the final whistle. Was that that was a night of you have right what you want to write
[4725.40 - 4731.48] P:1654.64 E:0.054545 |  It was an awful night and Steve McLaren got dogs abuse as well from some of the fans out there
[4732.20 - 4736.84] P:1848.59 E:0.064586 |  Stephen Gerrard in the end bailed England out with a couple of goals and the third goal was scored
[4736.84 - 4744.36] P:1684.00 E:0.051694 |  by Nugent as well who hasn't been seen since in the England squad. Lampard of England on to Beckham
[4744.36 - 4749.96] P:1798.43 E:0.064147 |  again total possession of the ball down that left hand side it's a great opportunity for
[4750.04 - 4755.08] P:1870.74 E:0.070982 |  Ashley Young here he goes past the a very half-hearted challenge then in the end the defender gets
[4755.08 - 4759.32] P:1859.30 E:0.066835 |  back and denies Ashley Young he should have got his crossing really it's another goal kick. Stumbled
[4759.32 - 4764.04] P:1801.56 E:0.069660 |  you just you just to worry a little bit with Ashley Young trying too hard which is
[4764.04 - 4768.04] P:1701.82 E:0.064820 |  perfectly normal in this situation. So are we happy with the pitch now here is everything
[4768.04 - 4774.68] P:1483.27 E:0.061462 |  great yeah I mean why wasn't they sorted out in the first place you know 960 million pounds
[4774.68 - 4779.64] P:1754.18 E:0.062588 |  for the stadium and three and six for the pitch. Right from day one when they played another 21 game
[4779.72 - 4784.68] P:1685.91 E:0.066907 |  here the first match against Italy it was clear that there were problems but it's okay this evening
[4784.68 - 4789.64] P:1829.24 E:0.063701 |  the ball is traveling through and or again looking to goalkeeper Caldo to come diving out
[4789.64 - 4794.44] P:1761.69 E:0.073032 |  England could make one more change was he out of his penalty area. No no no there's a little nudge
[4794.44 - 4800.84] P:1772.58 E:0.061220 |  by Walcott on that on the on the six he now wants to fight him. He'll defonsely in there just
[4801.40 - 4809.08] P:1643.92 E:0.045723 |  oh makes you laugh isn't it. They've hard just hearing that Holland now lead Norway by two
[4809.08 - 4814.04] P:1680.97 E:0.060610 |  goals to nil in Scotland's group but remember Holland have already qualified it's all about
[4814.76 - 4821.00] P:1767.00 E:0.065125 |  second place there earlier Macedonia had a victory against Iceland as well Macedonia to
[4821.00 - 4826.20] P:1758.19 E:0.063697 |  Iceland nil so Macedonia now level with Scotland seven points each but Scotland do have a game in
[4826.20 - 4830.84] P:1614.71 E:0.062160 |  hand. Now we've got a free kick to Andorra but the refs just had a word with Ildefonse Lema
[4830.84 - 4837.80] P:1409.30 E:0.064613 |  like he's saying stop your moaning. Well I have to say that they were at it in all the previous three
[4837.80 - 4843.56] P:1743.81 E:0.071578 |  matches as well really and again as Ildefonse Lema ran forward then he still had to have a word
[4843.56 - 4850.28] P:1720.80 E:0.064322 |  and a nudge with David Beckham as well. Free kick to Andorra it's hit long towards Terry and Ildefonse
[4850.28 - 4857.32] P:1666.38 E:0.059800 |  Lema and Lema just platters into John Terry and the free kick is instantly given free kick to England
[4857.32 - 4862.36] P:1531.82 E:0.058475 |  on the edge of the penalty area. There's not great motivation though now is there really in this.
[4862.68 - 4868.68] P:1589.23 E:0.063467 |  Zero. No three nil England lampal on the ball but there are more international goals here for
[4868.68 - 4873.56] P:1753.20 E:0.066022 |  individuals as well Beckham would love one I'm sure. Wolcott who just has that hat trick against
[4873.56 - 4880.20] P:1898.81 E:0.065941 |  Croatia Wolcott dancing down the line four Andorra players around him now five Wolcott's taking them
[4880.20 - 4886.20] P:1674.36 E:0.057903 |  all on and the end the ball goes behind the line and it's a goal kick once more to Andorra. Yeah I
[4886.20 - 4893.48] P:1331.64 E:0.056051 |  think it was Synergy wasn't it who stopped him. Lots of energy but no synergy. And Catello stands
[4895.24 - 4901.88] P:1406.13 E:0.061945 |  and surveys the scene. They say farewell to the squad until August the 12th when they play a friendly
[4901.88 - 4907.08] P:1549.35 E:0.061630 |  match away to Holland and that's even before the Premier League season starts. How nuts is that?
[4907.08 - 4911.80] P:1623.94 E:0.067267 |  Three days before the Premier League so the Premier League managers get players back for five weeks
[4911.80 - 4915.80] P:1772.10 E:0.075642 |  then losing for that week absolutely crazy. Which was another reason why Gus Hiddick really could
[4915.80 - 4919.96] P:1745.06 E:0.052470 |  not be in charge of Chelsea next season because I think Russia are probably playing on night night
[4919.96 - 4923.64] P:1643.56 E:0.066332 |  as well and there are qualifying games by the way being played on that night in England's group.
[4924.52 - 4930.84] P:1631.61 E:0.057655 |  Here they come again lampard this is five live England three Andorra nil Beckham that's a great
[4930.84 - 4935.64] P:1784.97 E:0.070724 |  ball from Beckham. Ashley Young has it and Cole immediately runs forward Ashley Cole for England
[4935.64 - 4940.36] P:1716.29 E:0.061706 |  turns it back header from Defoe is wide might have had that on target. Yeah great play from England
[4940.36 - 4946.28] P:1535.61 E:0.065360 |  starting with Beckham's long sort diagonal ball but when the cross came into Defoe from Ashley Cole
[4946.28 - 4951.88] P:1222.38 E:0.059844 |  he seemed to get his angles wrong didn't he? Yet another clearance for Caldo.
[4953.48 - 4960.28] P:1482.55 E:0.058884 |  Robert Green just stands on the edge of his penalty area. I did put it to Fabio Catello yesterday
[4960.28 - 4964.04] P:1652.51 E:0.067246 |  one of the chances of Paul Robinson coming on and playing at centre forward for you this evening
[4964.04 - 4967.96] P:1761.79 E:0.064510 |  bearing in mind that Stuart Pierce did the same thing with the other 21s it's not going to happen.
[4967.96 - 4973.48] P:1780.10 E:0.064551 |  Now Crouch again on to Ashley Young trying to provide down the left hand side Young's falling
[4973.48 - 4978.28] P:1742.84 E:0.073037 |  Crouch goalkeeper spells it defender clears. Justin a good play by Ashley Young just needed a touch
[4978.28 - 4983.00] P:1605.28 E:0.068946 |  didn't it that's all it needed from Crouch to con staccato a long right leg but just couldn't quite
[4983.00 - 4986.92] P:1600.14 E:0.070692 |  get the touch in. Johnson that's a poor one in this time from Johnson doesn't clear the first
[4986.92 - 4993.16] P:1591.50 E:0.067385 |  defender and then cleared and then cleared straight back to England. I'm not sure Andorra have really
[4994.12 - 4997.88] P:1797.04 E:0.071894 |  crowd cheering because Robert Green's got his first touch just about I think
[4997.88 - 5001.64] P:1392.35 E:0.062401 |  of the second half hasn't he outside the penalty area. Number four, number four.
[5001.64 - 5005.56] P:1913.84 E:0.076093 |  Ball now to Ashley Young they're certainly feeding Ashley Young whenever they can down that
[5005.56 - 5011.00] P:1822.09 E:0.067042 |  left hand side interesting ball into Crouch Crouch just nudged away by Defender Valets back again
[5011.00 - 5016.68] P:1745.70 E:0.069022 |  to Young once more Young to the ever unmarked Ashley Cole back into central midfield and Beckham
[5016.68 - 5022.44] P:1752.95 E:0.065398 |  Beckham looking for Defoe full stretch was our friend Ildefonse Lima and Andorra are struggling
[5022.44 - 5026.68] P:1819.23 E:0.069790 |  really to get this ball out of their own half they are building through midfield they chip it
[5026.68 - 5034.84] P:1758.63 E:0.057555 |  innocuously forward Lescott is there and now Glenn Johnson again it's just relentless Andorra
[5034.84 - 5040.52] P:1710.70 E:0.056023 |  try and clear they don't hold on to it back come England once more one more change Fabio Capello
[5040.52 - 5044.92] P:1787.93 E:0.060123 |  can make if he wants to I'm sure he will. Lampard Beckham lets it run through his legs and it's
[5044.92 - 5051.00] P:1735.48 E:0.057403 |  Johnson again just inside the Andorra half England three Andorra nil Beckham in this
[5051.00 - 5055.56] P:1711.11 E:0.063903 |  role that he really covers in central midfield Lampard's chip forward Defender
[5056.20 - 5061.48] P:1914.13 E:0.068711 |  Jamea managed to head it out of the penalty area the centre forward is there silver and that's just
[5061.48 - 5066.84] P:1661.89 E:0.065915 |  wretched I mean just looked up to see where the nearest white shirt was and gave it straight
[5066.84 - 5073.64] P:1475.91 E:0.060765 |  back to England and Beckham England on the ball once more with Lescott it's Jermaine Defoe left
[5073.64 - 5079.64] P:1610.38 E:0.071859 |  hand side what the earth must the boys of 66 be making of this one-way traffic game England
[5079.72 - 5085.24] P:1611.80 E:0.072015 |  building on the edge of the Andorra area the drums beat around Wembley Beckham thinks about the
[5085.24 - 5091.00] P:1706.77 E:0.068366 |  shot scoops it into the penalty area Crouch acrobatically fires it in off the defender for a corner kick
[5091.00 - 5095.32] P:1690.34 E:0.059724 |  yeah great ball from Beckham great vision just dinked it over the last defender
[5095.32 - 5099.64] P:1791.64 E:0.069089 |  initial first touch by Crouch on his chest and then there's something must have just got a touch on it
[5100.76 - 5104.52] P:1923.61 E:0.083597 |  all you're doing here though now really is giving players international experience there's no way
[5104.52 - 5110.68] P:1856.65 E:0.071030 |  that Fabio Capello can genuinely assess anybody here as the corner kick is knocked back almost to
[5110.68 - 5115.96] P:1823.92 E:0.063498 |  the half wayline to Ashley Cole by David Beckham Beckham now ball into the area oh and Lescott
[5115.96 - 5121.24] P:1593.08 E:0.066909 |  almost got on the end of it and there's again it's gone wide and it's another goal kick second chance
[5121.24 - 5126.44] P:1693.20 E:0.070287 |  for Lescott she scored in the first half with a header and and again right foot volleyed it just
[5126.44 - 5131.24] P:1569.14 E:0.066069 |  looks like he wasn't watching the ball all the way through he wasn't might it wasn't a corner either
[5131.24 - 5139.16] P:1606.01 E:0.056003 |  mate 58 minutes gone and it's a sort of end of season ball really that it's I think Graham Taylor
[5139.16 - 5143.16] P:1747.89 E:0.072449 |  said earlier it's like a sort of testimonial for somebody at the end of the season I've seen better
[5143.16 - 5148.52] P:1729.89 E:0.067310 |  testimonials than this we have another word from Graham in a moment as cold oak clears it won't stay
[5148.52 - 5153.32] P:1813.45 E:0.061876 |  in the England half for very long as Lescott is there again and back they come should be more than
[5153.32 - 5158.20] P:1769.12 E:0.059056 |  three nil really if you're going to be hyper critical Beckham and he's just picking out the passes
[5158.20 - 5162.84] P:1827.50 E:0.063016 |  once more onto Ashley Young's head it wasn't a good header though by the Villa player but he's
[5162.84 - 5167.56] P:1637.55 E:0.062305 |  immediately going to try and win it back over on that left hand side putting pressure on Merano
[5168.20 - 5173.40] P:1747.09 E:0.061963 |  now the pressure on the fullback and Andorra give it away Beckham was almost in Andorra just
[5173.40 - 5180.28] P:1787.39 E:0.060964 |  smashed it out a player on the far side and Graham Taylor anything new to tell us not at all it's
[5180.28 - 5185.40] P:1956.01 E:0.080175 |  it's a continuation of England's domination as they had in the first half and it's really just a
[5185.40 - 5190.28] P:1928.29 E:0.066699 |  question how many goals are England going to score I think they've missed two or three opportunities
[5190.28 - 5197.80] P:1929.81 E:0.064891 |  already in this half but that's all it is it's just watching one side completely dominate another side
[5198.68 - 5202.76] P:1931.38 E:0.061761 |  thank you very much Graham again Ashley Young with the ball in and again it wasn't particularly well
[5202.76 - 5209.64] P:1815.74 E:0.057796 |  delivered the new player Valais is there and it's out of play over on the far side throw into England
[5209.64 - 5215.96] P:1566.24 E:0.054711 |  three nil they lead almost an hour gone here at Wembley and the ball is with Ashley Cole
[5216.60 - 5221.72] P:1776.44 E:0.068940 |  too young yo young goes around the defender high one into the penalty area header from
[5221.72 - 5224.84] P:1723.02 E:0.075338 |  Theo Walcott that's glanced off the defender nobody seems to know where it is it's spinning
[5224.84 - 5230.92] P:1651.21 E:0.063819 |  away for a corner England corner near side and that means Beckham will come across from the center
[5230.92 - 5237.72] P:1779.73 E:0.061584 |  to take it now here's an opportunity surely from a set piece to make it four and the crowd stand
[5238.36 - 5245.24] P:1873.08 E:0.064534 |  and cheer David Beckham Beckham sees Lescott and Terry moving forward and prepares to take the
[5245.24 - 5250.44] P:1973.61 E:0.069354 |  corner kick he glides the ball in towards crouch two defenders get in ahead of crouch Beckham now
[5250.44 - 5255.32] P:1802.94 E:0.071318 |  with a chance to float another ball in can't clear Ildefan Sleemer though but it'll drop now to Young
[5255.32 - 5261.00] P:1837.07 E:0.058767 |  again on the left side of the penalty area young with the fullback Ayala cross coming in it can't
[5261.00 - 5265.08] P:1885.56 E:0.069693 |  once more defeat the Andorran central defenders Glenn Johnson caught in possession on the edge
[5265.08 - 5269.72] P:1762.53 E:0.059210 |  of the penalty area Ildefan Sleemer has been pushed over he won't like that and that's a free kick
[5269.72 - 5275.24] P:1487.36 E:0.054840 |  to Andorra now raise up two poor crosses by Beckham in all honesty for a man of his quality
[5276.12 - 5281.40] P:1793.42 E:0.064157 |  thing is though when it is just so easy like this you do become lethargic don't you yeah
[5281.40 - 5290.52] P:1516.30 E:0.047400 |  send me play of you free kick to Andorra and we've played now 61 and a half minutes of the game
[5291.48 - 5294.60] P:1702.25 E:0.067062 |  we're going to make another change they're going to make another change why can't they wait till
[5294.60 - 5300.28] P:1530.06 E:0.050638 |  Greeny takes over clearance to the far side of the field ball drops inside the England half
[5300.92 - 5304.28] P:1668.41 E:0.064746 |  they've only got one man down field Andorra and it doesn't stick with him
[5304.28 - 5308.60] P:1771.50 E:0.067816 |  and Johnson clears and now Walcott's got room down the right hand side the near side of the field
[5308.60 - 5313.24] P:1834.18 E:0.074261 |  crouch at the speed now from Theo Walcott who remember is going off to join the under 21s in
[5313.24 - 5317.56] P:1844.39 E:0.069516 |  Sweden Walcott hits the defenders backside ran a long way with the ball there to win a
[5317.56 - 5320.68] P:1731.62 E:0.070894 |  throw in by the corner play bridge is coming on with whole Wayne bridge
[5323.48 - 5327.40] P:1694.19 E:0.072289 |  so bridge to come on for Ashley Cole I assume I have think it's Robert Green
[5329.24 - 5334.92] P:1621.22 E:0.061808 |  throw in taken for England and John Terry finds Frank Lantar Lantar goes around and nothing
[5334.92 - 5339.40] P:1717.70 E:0.067324 |  challenge shoots goalkeeper Paris it comes out to Walcott and the wall caught hits crouch with
[5339.40 - 5344.28] P:1694.19 E:0.066572 |  his shot I'm not sure whether it was going in but crouch made sure it wasn't going in
[5344.36 - 5348.04] P:1594.86 E:0.069384 |  Walcott perhaps should have done better as well and it's another goal kick and I think that was
[5348.04 - 5353.72] P:1547.24 E:0.063085 |  going in right where's Wayne bridge I can't see I really I really do so Ray Clements is down there
[5353.72 - 5358.36] P:1558.31 E:0.061371 |  trying to sort things out Crouch he did well to stop it you could play for Andorra at the back
