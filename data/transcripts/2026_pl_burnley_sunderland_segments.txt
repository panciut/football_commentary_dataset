[0.00 - 1.00] P:1634.78 E:0.010829 |  Thanks Mark.
[1.00 - 6.00] P:1771.27 E:0.079355 |  Surf more back in the Premier League, it feels ready to go as the teams emerge.
[6.00 - 10.00] P:1775.86 E:0.123966 |  Now from the opposite corner of the stadium from where they once walked,
[10.00 - 13.00] P:1697.19 E:0.139107 |  over in the northeast of where we're viewing.
[13.00 - 17.00] P:1826.67 E:0.126282 |  That view extends over the Bob-Lord stand, that shallow single-tiered stand,
[17.00 - 20.00] P:1721.80 E:0.136740 |  over the rolling hills of Lancashire.
[20.00 - 25.00] P:1822.43 E:0.129104 |  The Terry's house is immediately behind the stand with light brickwork in it.
[25.00 - 29.00] P:1901.09 E:0.128294 |  Old industrial factory chimney rises high as well.
[29.00 - 33.00] P:1753.13 E:0.127339 |  But the focus is on the green grass of turf more.
[33.00 - 38.00] P:1706.11 E:0.131124 |  Where the fans that surround the pitch have been called on by manager Scott Parker,
[38.00 - 39.00] P:1857.80 E:0.116416 |  ahead of today's game.
[39.00 - 43.00] P:1835.52 E:0.115002 |  After last weekend's Screnna opening day defeat at Spurs,
[43.00 - 46.00] P:1840.22 E:0.112179 |  Screnna was also house Sunderlands game finished,
[46.00 - 50.00] P:1847.41 E:0.115283 |  but in the black cat's favour, the stadium are like rocking after an eight-year absence
[50.00 - 51.00] P:1899.44 E:0.113550 |  in the Premier League.
[51.00 - 52.00] P:1698.61 E:0.124215 |  They returned in style.
[52.00 - 55.00] P:1823.64 E:0.120641 |  Now some of those supporters are in the cricket ground,
[55.00 - 58.00] P:1840.13 E:0.114836 |  stand away to our right-hand side, two-thirds of that stand is theirs.
[58.00 - 62.00] P:1788.69 E:0.119845 |  And plenty of red and white stripes on display.
[62.00 - 66.00] P:1836.80 E:0.115817 |  Sunderland, Charlie Adam from the Premier League midfield alongside myself,
[66.00 - 67.00] P:1934.63 E:0.107192 |  Mike Minow this afternoon.
[67.00 - 69.00] P:1868.13 E:0.110025 |  Sunderland started in style.
[69.00 - 72.00] P:1895.63 E:0.118850 |  Burnley already being asked, the manager Scott Parker,
[72.00 - 74.00] P:1822.82 E:0.121157 |  is this a must win for them?
[74.00 - 75.00] P:1673.13 E:0.109067 |  Yeah, it's incredible, isn't it?
[75.00 - 79.00] P:1848.55 E:0.112638 |  That's their level and their league level of the Premier League.
[79.00 - 84.00] P:1846.89 E:0.116363 |  You face a tough away game at Tottenham who brought in a new manager,
[84.00 - 87.00] P:1938.64 E:0.110063 |  champions of Europe.
[87.00 - 92.00] P:1835.52 E:0.113151 |  Feel good factor around Tottenham and you get there and you get your first home game yet.
[92.00 - 96.00] P:1727.74 E:0.097977 |  And people are asking, is this a must win?
[96.00 - 98.00] P:1778.91 E:0.109056 |  Only because the next five or six fixtures,
[98.00 - 99.00] P:1775.28 E:0.100918 |  what you look at.
[99.00 - 102.00] P:1668.81 E:0.106538 |  By the Premier League, anything can happen.
[102.00 - 104.00] P:1629.37 E:0.112387 |  You look at Tottenham today, going and beating Man City.
[104.00 - 108.00] P:1745.37 E:0.108658 |  You know, it's just showing that the work that Thomas Franks done really well.
[108.00 - 110.00] P:1836.72 E:0.110557 |  Sunderland obviously beat West Ham,
[110.00 - 114.00] P:1738.52 E:0.111272 |  who ended up getting hammered 5-1 last night at home to Chelsea.
[114.00 - 116.00] P:1692.91 E:0.123627 |  So they're in a difficult period.
[116.00 - 120.00] P:1682.82 E:0.119793 |  So for Sunderland to get West Ham on the opening day of the season, they were delighted.
[120.00 - 125.00] P:1845.65 E:0.119130 |  Now Burnley have got Sunderland who they've matched, played each other a couple of times last year.
[125.00 - 128.00] P:1635.94 E:0.120092 |  One win for Sunderland, one draw.
[128.00 - 132.00] P:1754.30 E:0.123231 |  It's now a moment for these Burnley players to really step up in the Premier League.
[132.00 - 134.00] P:1569.07 E:0.128447 |  And the big thing for the players is in the management,
[134.00 - 136.00] P:1658.52 E:0.115038 |  we'll be getting that first win of the season.
[136.00 - 140.00] P:1512.37 E:0.113292 |  When they get that, they can hopefully then grow in confidence.
[140.00 - 142.00] P:1687.32 E:0.106115 |  Because it took them after a few games,
[142.00 - 144.00] P:1521.06 E:0.121219 |  the last time they were in the Premier League,
[144.00 - 146.00] P:1699.86 E:0.120776 |  two years ago to get that first win.
[146.00 - 148.00] P:1610.94 E:0.115010 |  So it's important that they can get that quickly.
[148.00 - 151.00] P:1738.16 E:0.118947 |  But it's a lot of good things happening at Burnley Football Club.
[151.00 - 154.00] P:1772.40 E:0.116043 |  And I think this could be a very, very good season for this team and this manager.
[154.00 - 156.00] P:1721.02 E:0.112527 |  Well, they've got Manchester United to come,
[156.00 - 160.00] P:1684.41 E:0.120793 |  Liverpool, Forest and Manchester City before the end of September as well.
[160.00 - 164.00] P:1693.81 E:0.118867 |  So is Sunderland a favourable home game for Burnley this afternoon?
[164.00 - 167.00] P:1835.60 E:0.118385 |  Yeah, absolutely. I think if you said that,
[167.00 - 172.00] P:1750.96 E:0.113683 |  could we have a home game and be against the promoted team on the first home game?
[172.00 - 176.00] P:1830.01 E:0.103394 |  So, of course, you look at Sunderland and everybody thinks that this is going to be a tough game,
[176.00 - 180.00] P:1782.96 E:0.100927 |  and it will be. But you have to focus on what you can do.
[180.00 - 182.00] P:1880.57 E:0.120706 |  Well, the head of kick-off, Burnley will pay tribute to one of their own,
[182.00 - 185.00] P:1879.96 E:0.119336 |  the former Claretson Northern Ireland striker, Willie Irving,
[185.00 - 190.00] P:1880.64 E:0.104314 |  who passed away last month, scored 78 goals in 126 appearances
[190.00 - 193.00] P:1809.09 E:0.099661 |  before later moving to Preston, Brighton and Halifax.
[193.00 - 198.00] P:1901.33 E:0.093965 |  He'll be marked here with a moment's remembrance from all sides of Turfmore.
[220.00 - 223.00] P:2024.30 E:0.109847 |  APPLAUSE
[230.00 - 233.00] P:1840.36 E:0.130104 |  Some old archive footage of Willie Irving playing for the Claretson
[233.00 - 238.00] P:1854.74 E:0.108783 |  on the big screen in the corner away to our left-hand side.
[238.00 - 241.00] P:1716.03 E:0.093087 |  So Burnley, who need to make this place a fortress
[241.00 - 243.00] P:1829.39 E:0.109855 |  if they want a chance to survive all this season,
[243.00 - 246.00] P:1736.00 E:0.106860 |  they only won two of 19 the last time they were in the top flight.
[246.00 - 250.00] P:1765.25 E:0.091676 |  That has to be better. The smartly dressed Scott Parker
[250.00 - 253.00] P:1938.54 E:0.100224 |  in his suit makes two changes to their first home game.
[253.00 - 255.00] P:1856.87 E:0.098539 |  Son and Laurent drop to the bench.
[255.00 - 257.00] P:1858.90 E:0.089900 |  Ogachukwu gets his first start for Burnley.
[257.00 - 259.00] P:1748.10 E:0.098181 |  Jakob Brunlasen comes in as well.
[259.00 - 261.00] P:1741.18 E:0.117346 |  So De Bruyker in goal.
[261.00 - 265.00] P:1731.00 E:0.107893 |  Walker Esteve, Eckdalen Hartman in the back four as Burnley begin proceedings,
[265.00 - 268.00] P:1729.97 E:0.102381 |  kicking from left to right in their Claretshirts,
[268.00 - 272.00] P:1725.28 E:0.100608 |  white shorts and sky-blue socks this afternoon.
[272.00 - 275.00] P:1678.51 E:0.106098 |  Already trying to hook it towards the edge of the penalty area
[275.00 - 277.00] P:1702.58 E:0.100806 |  away to our right-hand side.
[277.00 - 280.00] P:1775.55 E:0.100424 |  The captain, Josh Cullen, who carried out his newborn child
[280.00 - 283.00] P:1839.64 E:0.105519 |  out of the tunnel when the teams emerged a little earlier,
[283.00 - 286.00] P:1624.57 E:0.109794 |  gets his foot on the ball and plays it back into his own half.
[286.00 - 288.00] P:1738.98 E:0.114427 |  He's in midfield alongside Ogachukwu.
[288.00 - 291.00] P:1681.12 E:0.100701 |  Brunlasen, Mej, Hannibal and Anthony
[291.00 - 295.00] P:1651.10 E:0.091934 |  are the attacking three midfielders, Lyle Foster.
[295.00 - 298.00] P:1678.54 E:0.106855 |  The number nine will lead the line this afternoon.
[298.00 - 301.00] P:1612.00 E:0.089907 |  As the Sunderland all in black, they're awake it.
[301.00 - 303.00] P:1843.76 E:0.101422 |  They kept a clean sheet last time out.
[303.00 - 306.00] P:1660.44 E:0.113130 |  They've kept a clean sheet in their last three matches with Burnley as well.
[306.00 - 308.00] P:1561.43 E:0.101034 |  They'll hope to extend that to four today.
[308.00 - 311.00] P:1788.44 E:0.107236 |  Reggie Labrice makes two changes,
[311.00 - 314.00] P:1709.83 E:0.099369 |  sealed two, did face a fitness test in the week after going off injured
[314.00 - 318.00] P:1539.82 E:0.094867 |  against West Ham in the second half.
[318.00 - 320.00] P:1800.63 E:0.100613 |  Is fit but only for the bench.
[320.00 - 323.00] P:1624.93 E:0.109037 |  So Alderete, who replaced sealed in the second half,
[323.00 - 325.00] P:1674.60 E:0.100656 |  comes in for his first Premier League start.
[325.00 - 327.00] P:1567.86 E:0.099362 |  Rousse is their goalkeeper.
[327.00 - 329.00] P:1676.58 E:0.116757 |  Some brilliant saves last weekend.
[329.00 - 332.00] P:1668.50 E:0.107081 |  The goal scorers Alderete and Ray Nildo
[332.00 - 335.00] P:1839.86 E:0.094472 |  lead back for Diara, Jacke and Siddiqui.
[335.00 - 338.00] P:1568.16 E:0.108223 |  The midfield, Taube, Mayenda and Odingra.
[338.00 - 342.00] P:1611.62 E:0.109523 |  The front three for the black cats, cladded in black this afternoon.
[342.00 - 345.00] P:1570.31 E:0.100994 |  The ball runs up towards the edge of the Burnley penalty area.
[345.00 - 348.00] P:1515.17 E:0.107378 |  Away to our left-hand side and Martin de Bralke,
[348.00 - 352.00] P:1684.25 E:0.100981 |  the 36-year-old to the vacuum, hooked it up towards the halfway line.
[352.00 - 354.00] P:1740.17 E:0.106513 |  A couple of headers between both teams
[354.00 - 356.00] P:1570.61 E:0.110391 |  and then Sunderland get the ball on the floor, playing it.
[356.00 - 359.00] P:1802.51 E:0.108032 |  So the near left-hand side, Seaman and Odingra offside,
[359.00 - 362.00] P:1712.36 E:0.094582 |  flag raised up and Burnley have a free kick
[362.00 - 364.00] P:1699.07 E:0.114555 |  just on the edge of their defensive. Charlie Adam.
[364.00 - 366.00] P:1782.64 E:0.111740 |  Yeah, a good start from Sunderland,
[366.00 - 369.00] P:1819.34 E:0.113122 |  trying to get forward and force Burnley back the pitch.
[369.00 - 373.00] P:1745.38 E:0.109871 |  But again, good atmosphere here and good energy to the game,
[373.00 - 374.00] P:1770.23 E:0.105029 |  which you'd expect.
[374.00 - 376.00] P:1702.28 E:0.112199 |  But it's important that the two in midfield,
[376.00 - 380.00] P:1738.80 E:0.106557 |  Ovingra, Tuchwan, Cullen can get trolled of Jacke
[380.00 - 384.00] P:1684.42 E:0.095647 |  and Diara is really important, he can get that.
[384.00 - 387.00] P:1667.67 E:0.089845 |  And if he can get that upper hand, Jacke, he's a...
[387.00 - 390.00] P:1609.66 E:0.106058 |  Listen, he's been a top player and been a very, very good player
[390.00 - 393.00] P:1780.36 E:0.109580 |  for Bayer Leverkusen over the last couple of years under Jaby Alonzo.
[393.00 - 396.00] P:1722.16 E:0.112957 |  So, you can see why Sunderland brought that man in
[396.00 - 398.00] P:1721.34 E:0.091845 |  and gained that a little bit serious.
[398.00 - 400.00] P:1610.55 E:0.087218 |  But this front three of Sunderland can cause you problems
[400.00 - 402.00] P:1647.85 E:0.107500 |  with the speed and the pace that they've got.
[402.00 - 406.00] P:1650.28 E:0.117095 |  Two grounds from the Burnley fans, as well, Foster.
[406.00 - 409.00] P:1627.49 E:0.107706 |  This place to pass answers right-hand side, missed Hannibal,
[409.00 - 412.00] P:1628.86 E:0.110283 |  and then that broke down, allowing Sunderland to come forward,
[412.00 - 416.00] P:1580.80 E:0.098965 |  who now want a free kick, ten yards inside the Burnley half,
[416.00 - 418.00] P:1676.35 E:0.118588 |  near side the left as we look at it for them.
[418.00 - 421.00] P:1769.14 E:0.112699 |  Couple of early goals in the Football League to tell you about.
[421.00 - 425.00] P:1705.59 E:0.110500 |  One at the top-sheet community standing where Bolton have gone one-nil down
[425.00 - 430.00] P:1526.12 E:0.106594 |  against Lincoln City, Northampton Town one-nil up against Exeter,
[430.00 - 432.00] P:1627.31 E:0.112128 |  both of those coming in in League One.
[432.00 - 437.00] P:1557.70 E:0.106377 |  Sunderland free kick, left-hand side, which Granik Jacke the captain,
[437.00 - 440.00] P:1659.74 E:0.119033 |  who you imagine will be on set-piece duty, certainly from a free kick
[440.00 - 442.00] P:1502.33 E:0.112134 |  and penalty kick perspective this season.
[442.00 - 446.00] P:1478.02 E:0.102096 |  Three minutes gone, nil-nil, Jacke left-footed, sent that ball,
[446.00 - 448.00] P:1681.93 E:0.115374 |  rotating with a load of backspin into the penalty area,
[448.00 - 453.00] P:1828.51 E:0.110541 |  and a chance and close range for Mayenda, saved by De Brouwer,
[453.00 - 456.00] P:1786.59 E:0.110881 |  who got down to his right-hand side pretty quickly.
[456.00 - 458.00] P:1847.46 E:0.099095 |  Sunderland have since given away a free kick,
[458.00 - 461.00] P:1760.64 E:0.107942 |  but it was the header across goal that was causing problems,
[461.00 - 464.00] P:1925.29 E:0.108353 |  and from close range, Mayenda will probably think he should have scored.
[464.00 - 467.00] P:1778.58 E:0.102470 |  Yeah, there's blocking going round the back, and it's to be first Sunderland.
[467.00 - 473.00] P:1632.53 E:0.097812 |  It's a good move, and Dallard gets a good free header into the middle of the goal,
[473.00 - 477.00] P:1666.39 E:0.107955 |  and they sure have done better than that, but it's a good save from De Brouwer.
[477.00 - 480.00] P:1710.52 E:0.096984 |  Right-footed Cushenvolleek De Brouwer down,
[480.00 - 486.00] P:1798.72 E:0.089779 |  but Mayenda, who got Sunderland's first goal on their return to the Premier League,
[486.00 - 491.00] P:1755.52 E:0.114411 |  but was what, slightly behind him maybe in his defence, but you back it up.
[491.00 - 493.00] P:1723.57 E:0.102036 |  Yeah, but I still think he got to get better contact on it, isn't he?
[493.00 - 496.00] P:1602.31 E:0.101582 |  But for Burnley, they're getting the block around the back
[496.00 - 498.00] P:1720.25 E:0.106238 |  and getting Ballard free, and that was the idea.
[498.00 - 503.00] P:1655.52 E:0.096817 |  But lovely ball from Jacke, important that back line of the seven of the defenders.
[503.00 - 507.00] P:1550.18 E:0.103835 |  They have to go back, they have to drop the line a little bit
[507.00 - 511.00] P:1634.64 E:0.085881 |  and move further back so that they don't allow that block.
[511.00 - 516.00] P:1639.35 E:0.112304 |  10 goals, 5 assists in the championship last season for Eliefer Mayenda.
[516.00 - 521.00] P:1463.00 E:0.089077 |  Don Ballard here, he's having some treatment from the physio,
[521.00 - 525.00] P:1635.40 E:0.097195 |  on his left hamstring, he's struggling down there,
[525.00 - 531.00] P:1817.42 E:0.104670 |  so influential last week for Sunderland, he won more Jules, more aerial Jules,
[531.00 - 533.00] P:1710.09 E:0.100161 |  had more shots, more shots on target,
[533.00 - 536.00] P:1720.65 E:0.109635 |  one more fouls and cleared more balls than any of his team-mates last week,
[536.00 - 538.00] P:1750.79 E:0.105554 |  Sunderland don't need to lose him.
[538.00 - 541.00] P:1682.17 E:0.110483 |  No, I think he's actually probably, looks like he's jarred his knee a little bit
[541.00 - 546.00] P:1573.88 E:0.098429 |  when he lands here, yeah, he just looks like he's jarred his knee a little bit
[546.00 - 548.00] P:1678.14 E:0.083427 |  and then, oh, he's groin, he's holding.
[548.00 - 551.00] P:1682.92 E:0.101916 |  So they're just looking to see maybe he's got a bit of a groin issue there.
[551.00 - 555.00] P:1668.56 E:0.108904 |  A couple of substitutes warming up for Sunderland, Neil Niel the score.
[555.00 - 558.00] P:1633.47 E:0.100202 |  They're making a sub already which is a blow
[558.00 - 560.00] P:1694.13 E:0.117483 |  because Dan Ballard's done really well for him, hasn't he,
[560.00 - 562.00] P:1802.65 E:0.099667 |  last season and also this year,
[562.00 - 566.00] P:1721.77 E:0.088515 |  so that'll be a blow to Sunderland in that back line.
[566.00 - 569.00] P:1827.20 E:0.111997 |  So Reggie Lebrice forced into an early change,
[569.00 - 573.00] P:1720.90 E:0.098166 |  five minutes in here at more overcast,
[573.00 - 576.00] P:1494.94 E:0.106199 |  Neil Niel the score between Burnley and Sunderland.
[576.00 - 579.00] P:1685.92 E:0.103804 |  Bournemouth have taken the lead against Wolves early on,
[579.00 - 582.00] P:1636.75 E:0.102344 |  Marcus Tvernier has got the goal there.
[582.00 - 586.00] P:1708.20 E:0.109692 |  In the Les Caledonia this will one up at Montrose in the Scottish Football League one.
[586.00 - 590.00] P:1708.65 E:0.098687 |  Stelling Albion have the lead at Chesterville have taken the lead at Harrogate,
[590.00 - 594.00] P:1643.69 E:0.096589 |  Swindon Town also leading Shrewsbury in League two.
[594.00 - 597.00] P:1744.35 E:0.097119 |  So you're up to date, five live sports extra,
[597.00 - 603.00] P:1647.15 E:0.102589 |  one of the over 200 Premier League games that five live will be bringing you
[603.00 - 605.00] P:1408.95 E:0.100336 |  throughout the season.
[608.00 - 614.00] P:1650.31 E:0.105917 |  Ballard is able to limp off, so has that changed the mind of manager Reggie Lebrice?
[614.00 - 617.00] P:1651.19 E:0.104466 |  We'll wait and see what he does, he stands in his track suit
[617.00 - 621.00] P:1760.15 E:0.106522 |  and white trainers, navy track suit, white trainers on the far side of the field.
[621.00 - 626.00] P:1719.81 E:0.092699 |  No, sorry Dindra, I think they're looking to definitely make that change now,
[626.00 - 629.00] P:1749.96 E:0.097754 |  it's important, you know, a second game of the season
[629.00 - 632.00] P:1580.37 E:0.100784 |  and if Ballard comes on and they lose them for 68 weeks,
[632.00 - 635.00] P:1775.76 E:0.109409 |  ultimately the player will want to stay on.
[635.00 - 637.00] P:1866.93 E:0.100282 |  Drifting ball out towards the left-hand side,
[637.00 - 641.00] P:1760.58 E:0.108682 |  has Burnley looked to get their first attempt on the Sunderland goal this afternoon,
[641.00 - 646.00] P:1842.61 E:0.101659 |  some clever work by Jaden Antony, a low ball in from that far side touch line.
[646.00 - 650.00] P:1817.35 E:0.110358 |  Delwood at the first time of asking by Sunderland and now wriggling away
[650.00 - 654.00] P:1758.06 E:0.104820 |  on that far side of the field, Mayenda trying to drag his team over the halfway line,
[654.00 - 658.00] P:1801.68 E:0.105958 |  which he does coming in field, Burnley have the numbers back,
[658.00 - 661.00] P:1790.33 E:0.104272 |  I think one of the last challenges in there was Quillenshey Hartman,
[661.00 - 666.00] P:1801.11 E:0.102516 |  their Dutch defender, now Burnley just calmed things down a little bit.
[666.00 - 672.00] P:1667.04 E:0.106214 |  Kyle Walker, his first game in the home end of Burnley here at Turfmore this afternoon
[672.00 - 677.00] P:1643.69 E:0.114042 |  after his summer move from Manchester City, good noise around Turfmore,
[677.00 - 680.00] P:1758.54 E:0.098300 |  back by that faithful that Scott Parker has called on.
[680.00 - 684.00] P:1773.82 E:0.085887 |  Hannibal out towards the left-hand touch line again, Antony just clips it back for Hartman,
[684.00 - 687.00] P:1704.89 E:0.108334 |  low along the ground, now Hannibal corner of the penalty area,
[687.00 - 689.00] P:1838.53 E:0.103092 |  there are four Claret shirts in that penalty area,
[689.00 - 692.00] P:1819.35 E:0.098947 |  one of them is Lyall Foster who rises for the header, it's passed him,
[692.00 - 696.00] P:1710.24 E:0.109459 |  but Burnley have kept this alive here, Hannibal can't find a route through the goal,
[696.00 - 699.00] P:1800.15 E:0.098553 |  Hartman squeezes it back out towards that far side,
[699.00 - 703.00] P:1779.76 E:0.098985 |  some defending for Traekeen to do, squares up against Jaden Antony, Cullen,
[703.00 - 707.00] P:1601.71 E:0.104012 |  the captain, pushes it back towards the edge of the centre circle,
[707.00 - 711.00] P:1683.03 E:0.105274 |  it's patient from Burnley, waiting for the right moment to feed that ball,
[711.00 - 714.00] P:1792.58 E:0.101369 |  the first one blocked off on its route through to Hannibal by Cullen,
[714.00 - 718.00] P:1796.88 E:0.097695 |  he gets a second chance to this time get it through to Jaden Antony,
[718.00 - 723.00] P:1769.62 E:0.109838 |  Sunderland a bit sloppy in their clearance, it's not the cleanest piece of play from either side,
[723.00 - 725.00] P:1731.76 E:0.118735 |  Burnley win it back on the edge of the centre circle.
[725.00 - 728.00] P:1853.25 E:0.118654 |  Yeah, good, just a little bit of experience with Kyle Walker,
[728.00 - 732.00] P:1736.43 E:0.103941 |  it's getting a bit frantic, you know, turnovers are there and Kyle Walker just stepping in,
[732.00 - 735.00] P:1654.02 E:0.115278 |  taking a bit of experience in there just to calm the game down,
[735.00 - 739.00] P:1690.31 E:0.105665 |  now Burnley looking to get control of the game, Ballard going down.
[739.00 - 746.00] P:1735.83 E:0.113595 |  He's played the ball over the top, Ralf Ostergoes chasing and it's left by Robin Rufs to
[746.00 - 749.00] P:1693.61 E:0.108326 |  let that go behind for a Sunderland goal kick, eight minutes played,
[749.00 - 753.00] P:1647.26 E:0.094595 |  then it's Burnley-Niel, Sunderland-Niel.
[753.00 - 759.00] P:1675.53 E:0.098409 |  Yeah, frantic start from both teams isn't it, you know, a lot of turnovers and that,
[759.00 - 762.00] P:1825.21 E:0.108912 |  but just getting that experience with Cullen and Uggatruc in midfield,
[762.00 - 766.00] P:1807.36 E:0.105592 |  they need to get control of the game and get on the ball and try and get a few passes there,
[766.00 - 771.00] P:1673.21 E:0.104700 |  but you could see with what Sunderland have, you know, with the boys of Dengarra
[771.00 - 775.00] P:1672.51 E:0.092861 |  and the boys at the top end of the pitch, Mayenda, they've got pace haven't they,
[775.00 - 778.00] P:1584.96 E:0.104971 |  they've got pass up, if Burnley allow them to turn the ball over
[778.00 - 783.00] P:1574.48 E:0.092634 |  and they can actually go and be able to run into the space, then Burnley could cause problems.
[783.00 - 789.00] P:1783.79 E:0.102010 |  So Burnley change, sorry, Sunderland change, Dan Ballard did come back on,
[789.00 - 793.00] P:1681.28 E:0.097779 |  but has been unable to continue, so nine minutes in,
[793.00 - 799.00] P:1577.88 E:0.101716 |  forced into their first substitution of the afternoon, and Jensen Silt comes on now.
[799.00 - 805.00] P:1775.68 E:0.091533 |  Having started last weekend against West Ham, he went off ten minutes into the second half, injured,
[805.00 - 812.00] P:1749.45 E:0.095489 |  got the fitness test, got the approval from Reggie Labrese in his press conference a couple of days ago,
[812.00 - 816.00] P:1845.63 E:0.108314 |  and he's now caught into action in that Sunderland back line.
[816.00 - 819.00] P:1751.17 E:0.107843 |  Ball played out towards the left-hand side, Lyall Foster pokes it on through,
[819.00 - 824.00] P:1877.51 E:0.111530 |  asking a lot of the legs of Jaden Antony, who ran out of time, ran out of space,
[824.00 - 828.00] P:1905.89 E:0.111299 |  but it was quick and it was shot from Burnley there on the left of the penalty area, Neil Neal.
[828.00 - 833.00] P:1793.19 E:0.092774 |  Yeah, good little pass, but Lyall Foster's way of pass has just overhitted there,
[833.00 - 838.00] P:1710.62 E:0.095634 |  but again, Antony Foster, you know, the relationship they had in terms of from last season,
[838.00 - 842.00] P:1777.05 E:0.099226 |  I thought Jaden Antony had done a brilliant job last year for the Burnley team,
[842.00 - 846.00] P:1786.79 E:0.110217 |  at the top end of the pitch, coming off a side in the goals, and this is good.
[846.00 - 850.00] P:1737.59 E:0.108230 |  This plays pass by the very experienced Granite Jack at the 32-year-old,
[850.00 - 853.00] P:1740.17 E:0.120075 |  just plays it out towards the far side, it rolls over for a throw in nobody there,
[853.00 - 856.00] P:1833.79 E:0.111715 |  in the black shirt of Sunderland, as Hannibal tries to squeeze in between two,
[856.00 - 861.00] P:1778.33 E:0.101958 |  Sunderland defenders goes down, appeals with his arms out, stretched to the referee,
[861.00 - 866.00] P:1621.20 E:0.104882 |  who this afternoon is Michael Salisbury, nothing given, and instead Sunderland will have a goalkeeper,
[866.00 - 870.00] P:1757.74 E:0.107229 |  with their goalkeeper Robin Rufus elsewhere in the football league.
[870.00 - 873.00] P:1773.12 E:0.112525 |  Barrow ahead at Colchester, Wickham won the look on Reading,
[873.00 - 876.00] P:1764.62 E:0.104092 |  Preston leading it to switch town by a goal to nearly the championship.
[876.00 - 882.00] P:1570.85 E:0.111850 |  Coventry City, who now do own the CBS Arena, celebrating with a goal from Hagee Wright,
[882.00 - 887.00] P:1591.35 E:0.107201 |  they lead Queen's Park Rangers 1-0, and Knotts County in front against Bromley by the same scoreline.
[887.00 - 891.00] P:1757.46 E:0.100453 |  You're up to date, five sports extra, live from Turf Moor,
[891.00 - 896.00] P:1712.07 E:0.100720 |  on one of your two Premier League commentaries this Saturday afternoon at three o'clock,
[896.00 - 900.00] P:1772.86 E:0.118659 |  with Arsenal leads to come at 5.30.
[901.00 - 907.00] P:1642.11 E:0.107317 |  And then tomorrow, Steve Crossman is at the brand new Hill Dickinson Stadium at Everton,
[907.00 - 915.00] P:1587.09 E:0.107212 |  for their first game, first official game in their brand new stadium on Bromley Moor dock in Liverpool.
[915.00 - 921.00] P:1603.79 E:0.100729 |  And as they host Brighton, and then from 4.30, it is full on against Manchester United on five lives,
[921.00 - 926.00] P:1654.04 E:0.103279 |  Premier League Sunday, Fleetwood ahead against Oldham in the Pete Wilde Derby.
[926.00 - 931.00] P:1685.12 E:0.084934 |  And the Filed Coast, Chet Evans has got the goal there in league two.
[931.00 - 936.00] P:1769.56 E:0.097515 |  Rufus, the Sunderland goalkeeper, flat, low along the floor, down the middle of the pitch to the halfway line.
[936.00 - 942.00] P:1714.92 E:0.098970 |  Sunderland now bringing out towards this near side. They do have the attacking pace of Talbi to use here.
[942.00 - 947.00] P:1553.98 E:0.087831 |  Shemzin, Talbi back onto the left-hand side, the near side, as we look at it in this first half,
[947.00 - 952.00] P:1752.67 E:0.100250 |  where it's Burnley-Nill, Sunderland-Nill, one big chance for Mayenda from the edge of the six-yard box,
[952.00 - 957.00] P:1726.80 E:0.090399 |  cushioned volley on his right foot that he saw saved, low by Dabravka.
[957.00 - 962.00] P:1727.40 E:0.090437 |  And Sunderland in possession, taking their time, they advanced into the Burnley heart,
[962.00 - 966.00] P:1568.71 E:0.106497 |  they played it back into their own territory, and then the long ball forward,
[966.00 - 969.00] P:1766.40 E:0.108384 |  runs straight on through for a comfortable kick, catch from Martin Dabravka.
[969.00 - 974.00] P:1678.45 E:0.098128 |  Yeah, good line from that Burnley defence there, Steph organising there with Eckdahl,
[974.00 - 978.00] P:1738.14 E:0.086472 |  allowing Sunderland there a long ball and going through to Dabravka.
[978.00 - 984.00] P:1656.15 E:0.091709 |  But again, looking for Hannibal really to jump from midfield to go and press that Sunderland defence
[984.00 - 989.00] P:1655.22 E:0.098890 |  and not allowing them to come out and step with a ball, because Brown Larson is doing a great job
[989.00 - 994.00] P:1664.86 E:0.093081 |  following a dingra all the way back, and it allows Keil Walker to go back inside the pitch
[994.00 - 997.00] P:1751.26 E:0.113027 |  for any of the pocket players or any of the runs from the pocket.
[997.00 - 1001.00] P:1849.57 E:0.112010 |  Burnley won a free kick just to the left of the centre-circle.
[1001.00 - 1007.00] P:1676.52 E:0.086476 |  Llyl Foster foul, both managers calm on the edge of their technical area.
[1007.00 - 1010.00] P:1612.21 E:0.094427 |  Scott Park has just retreated back to his seat.
[1010.00 - 1019.00] P:1506.38 E:0.096325 |  Magyla Brees has got his arms folded, Scott Parker has won 97 games as a manager in title.
[1019.00 - 1026.00] P:1593.43 E:0.106265 |  He's closing in on that sentry, won 30 of his 51 matches in charge of Burnley.
[1026.00 - 1031.00] P:1708.42 E:0.117649 |  Looking to get that first crucial home win of the season, they watched fellow promoted sides,
[1031.00 - 1036.00] P:1607.33 E:0.106004 |  Sunderland and Leeds win last weekend Burnley, as they lost 3-0 to Spurs,
[1036.00 - 1039.00] P:1684.04 E:0.100426 |  so can they now get themselves off the mark?
[1039.00 - 1041.00] P:1694.34 E:0.107230 |  Keil Walker right footed, sends the ball into the penalty area,
[1041.00 - 1045.00] P:1801.32 E:0.104080 |  he's knocked down, edge of the box for Hannibal, a smash into a crowd of players.
[1045.00 - 1049.00] P:1852.84 E:0.106720 |  Really put his boot behind that, the cross comes in from the right-hand side-off,
[1049.00 - 1055.00] P:1944.49 E:0.107719 |  Ektal deflects off Ray Nildo and goes behind for Burnley's first corner of the game, 0-0.
[1055.00 - 1057.00] P:1762.99 E:0.099954 |  Yeah, Keil Walker just there, clipping it to the back post,
[1057.00 - 1061.00] P:1732.98 E:0.102456 |  keeping it alive and no opportunity for Hartman now to be able to put the ball in the box,
[1061.00 - 1066.00] P:1601.41 E:0.083702 |  in swinging corner, which Hartman will take.
[1066.00 - 1071.00] P:1820.64 E:0.104406 |  So left footed in swinging delivery, expected on this near side, Burnley's right,
[1071.00 - 1078.00] P:1859.62 E:0.097894 |  in front of the Sunderland fans, Robin Rousse raises two arms in the air in his orange goalkeeper kit this afternoon,
[1078.00 - 1083.00] P:1865.78 E:0.098101 |  he's got a busy six-yard box to negotiate that then cleared a lot of space as Hartman's ball came in
[1083.00 - 1085.00] P:1955.10 E:0.101357 |  and it was an easy catch for the Sunderland goalkeeper.
[1085.00 - 1089.00] P:1696.29 E:0.103105 |  Yeah, I thought it was too much height on it and there was no blockers on the goalkeeper,
[1089.00 - 1091.00] P:1739.09 E:0.089675 |  but Keil Walker's made a mistake here.
[1091.00 - 1095.00] P:1810.05 E:0.100094 |  Yeah, poor touch, he's just passed that in effect at Noah Siddiqui.
[1095.00 - 1098.00] P:1667.69 E:0.107968 |  Now it's on the left-hand side for Sunderland, lovely ball played through,
[1098.00 - 1104.00] P:1757.71 E:0.106571 |  chance here for Talby, who chips it round to Brabka and over and passed the post on the far side,
[1104.00 - 1108.00] P:1911.76 E:0.104737 |  wide of goal it goes, but another half chance there for Sunderland,
[1108.00 - 1114.00] P:1730.68 E:0.090614 |  little more tricky this one for Talby, dinked it from the left of the six-yard box,
[1114.00 - 1117.00] P:1833.83 E:0.106004 |  over to the far right post, it runs wide, it's still 0-0.
[1117.00 - 1122.00] P:1708.71 E:0.108690 |  Yeah, it's a lovely little ball from a dinger, just cuts back inside and the run from the pocket of Talby there
[1122.00 - 1127.00] P:1587.02 E:0.099184 |  and just puts it just inches by the post, but again, the Brabka coming out
[1127.00 - 1129.00] P:1697.71 E:0.102412 |  has obviously made it a little harder for him.
[1129.00 - 1133.00] P:1612.55 E:0.082001 |  Brentford have the lead against Aston Villa at the G-Tec,
[1133.00 - 1139.00] P:1728.09 E:0.094096 |  Dango Watara has scored, that is your commentary over on BBC Radio 5 Live.
[1139.00 - 1145.00] P:1805.38 E:0.098333 |  Brackley in the National League ahead against the leaders, Rochdale, Mansfield 1-0 up on late in Orient,
[1145.00 - 1150.00] P:1711.06 E:0.077232 |  Wreckson have scored through Keefermore, and then it's Sheffield Wednesday,
[1150.00 - 1153.00] P:1665.39 E:0.106639 |  I thought my Sheffield United man on the scoresheet there is,
[1153.00 - 1156.00] P:1703.73 E:0.101573 |  the Brabka sends it right for it, longer over the halfway line,
[1156.00 - 1161.00] P:1710.09 E:0.106954 |  missed header from Brun Larson, then they do win a throw in 10 yards inside the Sunderland.
[1161.00 - 1164.00] P:1592.69 E:0.112566 |  That's exactly what you want from your £40 million new sign there, isn't it?
[1164.00 - 1168.00] P:1645.47 E:0.097302 |  Scoring on his debut, Awha from Bollumith, but no, here it's,
[1168.00 - 1171.00] P:1643.67 E:0.082950 |  that mistake from Kyle Walker allowing Sunderland that half a chance,
[1171.00 - 1175.00] P:1589.35 E:0.085232 |  but again, dangerous on the counter-attack Sunderland so far.
[1178.00 - 1183.00] P:1561.92 E:0.099495 |  Burnley misplaced the ball down the middle looking for the run of Lyle Foster,
[1183.00 - 1188.00] P:1609.67 E:0.103282 |  so Sunderland back in possession over on that far side there, right in the opening 45 minutes.
[1188.00 - 1193.00] P:1589.93 E:0.108738 |  We've had quarter of an hour, it is Neil Mill, the two big chances to the away side.
[1193.00 - 1199.00] P:1503.61 E:0.108181 |  Yeah, but I think the big chances have come from Burnley's own mistakes, haven't they?
[1199.00 - 1206.00] P:1481.08 E:0.098099 |  Set play and also that touch from Kyle Walker, but when the Burnley start to grow into the game
[1206.00 - 1210.00] P:1563.78 E:0.096931 |  and they get control of the game, which they need to with Ugo Chukwa and Cullen,
[1210.00 - 1214.00] P:1591.51 E:0.096934 |  they need to get on the ball if they can and get a few passes together,
[1214.00 - 1220.00] P:1506.82 E:0.086551 |  get a little bit of the crowd in with the team and then we'll see a different Burnley,
[1220.00 - 1223.00] P:1627.06 E:0.074306 |  but at the moment, Sunderland have had a lot of the ball.
[1224.00 - 1227.00] P:1553.94 E:0.111919 |  I've had those two chances, this is Seelt on the ball,
[1227.00 - 1230.00] P:1628.66 E:0.108991 |  Sunderland who played out and Neil Mill draw here.
[1230.00 - 1234.00] P:1711.54 E:0.100479 |  Back in January in the championship, they missed two penalties,
[1234.00 - 1236.00] P:1475.12 E:0.108291 |  one in the 87th and one in the 94th minute.
[1236.00 - 1240.00] P:1651.29 E:0.108958 |  They did with 1-0 at the stadium alike, despite going down the 10 men,
[1240.00 - 1246.00] P:1589.07 E:0.097577 |  remain mumbled with the winner at that day for Regille Abriese's side.
[1246.00 - 1251.00] P:1598.94 E:0.100124 |  Elsewhere, former Burnley manager Sean Dike's son has scored for Northampton Town.
[1251.00 - 1257.00] P:1481.18 E:0.101618 |  Max Deitsch has made it 2-0 at home against Exeter City in League 1.
[1257.00 - 1262.00] P:1542.20 E:0.104210 |  So you're up to date, five sports extra, live from Turfmore.
[1265.00 - 1267.00] P:1701.18 E:0.112342 |  Swinging the miss from Leslie Ugo Chukwa.
[1267.00 - 1271.00] P:1617.75 E:0.096298 |  It's offside as Sunderland play the ball deeper into the Burnley half.
[1271.00 - 1277.00] P:1580.13 E:0.090070 |  So it is a Burnley free kick, 15 yards or so inside their own half.
[1277.00 - 1282.00] P:1675.93 E:0.103012 |  It was looking like a step might take it, but he's relinquished that duty for the captain,
[1282.00 - 1286.00] P:1619.10 E:0.097469 |  Josh Cullen to take instead.
[1286.00 - 1293.00] P:1481.36 E:0.096642 |  Cullen who's over 100 league appearances for Burnley since coming here in 2022.
[1293.00 - 1295.00] P:1566.75 E:0.113289 |  And that's a mistake at the back from Sunderland.
[1295.00 - 1298.00] P:1890.44 E:0.119456 |  Lyle Foster with the shot, with the goal.
[1300.00 - 1303.00] P:1814.76 E:0.121279 |  And he's been disallowed, is it? Huge appeals.
[1303.00 - 1308.00] P:1905.85 E:0.116273 |  No, it does stand. Lyle Foster scores from the left of the penalty area.
[1308.00 - 1311.00] P:1817.99 E:0.116227 |  Hannibal wasn't happy with something the referee did in that.
[1311.00 - 1317.00] P:1845.38 E:0.115939 |  They are surrounding the referee in the aftermath, but Foster from the left sends it past Robin Rooks.
[1317.00 - 1323.00] P:1897.54 E:0.112693 |  Burnley often running in their season. They've got the first goal, but VAR is going to check it.
[1323.00 - 1329.00] P:1829.43 E:0.113245 |  I don't think, yeah, Lyle Foster knew, neither did the fans that that goal had been ruled out.
[1329.00 - 1331.00] P:1928.52 E:0.108480 |  They're going to check it for a foul, Charlie.
[1331.00 - 1336.00] P:1783.64 E:0.106748 |  Long ball from Cullen and Anthony goes up with Tray Hume, their poor touch of Hume.
[1336.00 - 1340.00] P:1714.34 E:0.114243 |  I just think it's a bit harsh. It's a bit harsh. You've got to be a bit stronger than that.
[1340.00 - 1344.00] P:1711.39 E:0.096902 |  Seltz really done a good job with the referee there.
[1344.00 - 1347.00] P:1692.45 E:0.092916 |  There's not much in it there, isn't it?
[1347.00 - 1355.00] P:1787.57 E:0.108051 |  So Lyle Foster clatters into the back of Seltz, trips him over and then goes through on goal with the ball.
[1355.00 - 1359.00] P:1816.14 E:0.096950 |  Right foot, it finished, into the foul right hand side of the goal.
[1359.00 - 1365.00] P:1734.41 E:0.111080 |  The goal has been ruled out and does not stand, so it is now Burnley-Neal, Sunderland-Neal.
[1365.00 - 1371.00] P:1613.47 E:0.107865 |  Yeah, I think with VAR nowadays, but the referee, as soon as the foul was committed, the referee wanted to blow his whistle,
[1371.00 - 1375.00] P:1618.42 E:0.104001 |  but he knew that VAR is obviously there to help him, so he allowed it to play on.
[1375.00 - 1379.00] P:1668.39 E:0.103908 |  And that's why I think the Burnley fans were cheering.
[1379.00 - 1381.00] P:1515.95 E:0.101491 |  But yeah, I think it's a little bit harsh.
[1381.00 - 1385.00] P:1759.68 E:0.110749 |  You know, I think he's done a good job in standing across Lyle Foster there,
[1385.00 - 1389.00] P:1632.58 E:0.103435 |  but it was a decent enough finish into the goal.
[1389.00 - 1392.00] P:1630.90 E:0.111669 |  But again, it just shows that, you know, that long balls,
[1392.00 - 1397.00] P:1512.60 E:0.111519 |  have you got to frail take that back if you don't want to defend properly, cause your own problems.
[1397.00 - 1403.00] P:1668.61 E:0.100727 |  Simon D'Ingra has been booked for having a few little hands over Hannibal,
[1403.00 - 1409.00] P:1677.76 E:0.109893 |  and then I think he catches him in the face, and that's why the referee has booked Simon D'Ingra.
[1409.00 - 1411.00] P:1745.89 E:0.112357 |  That's over on the near side touch line.
[1411.00 - 1413.00] P:1779.02 E:0.106761 |  So the goal doesn't stand for clarity.
[1413.00 - 1421.00] P:1574.51 E:0.095365 |  Lyle Foster comes in from behind on Jensen Silt,
[1421.00 - 1424.00] P:1754.15 E:0.119567 |  and in tripping him up, then goes through on goal to score.
[1424.00 - 1429.00] P:1662.40 E:0.093249 |  So it was only temporary celebrations for Burnley.
[1429.00 - 1430.00] P:1720.79 E:0.115337 |  The fans thought it stood.
[1430.00 - 1431.00] P:1812.87 E:0.119958 |  Lyle Foster certainly did.
[1431.00 - 1437.00] P:1723.93 E:0.113286 |  He ran off over to the corner flag, and there was a little delay before VAR ruled the goal out.
[1437.00 - 1440.00] P:1635.61 E:0.110658 |  Suddenly have a man down here in the form of Ray Nildo and have a free kick.
[1440.00 - 1443.00] P:1704.43 E:0.098886 |  Yeah, just Hannibal there, just blocks.
[1443.00 - 1448.00] P:1613.66 E:0.099039 |  Reinaldo's attempt to head the ball there and giving away a foul.
[1448.00 - 1450.00] P:1662.89 E:0.089626 |  But that was a little bit of momentum.
[1450.00 - 1451.00] P:1566.91 E:0.112331 |  The crowd's up now.
[1451.00 - 1453.00] P:1664.28 E:0.095943 |  They have to go and use that.
[1453.00 - 1458.00] P:1604.40 E:0.090228 |  Maybe get it in the corner, and just a needless foul there from Hannibal.
[1458.00 - 1461.00] P:1508.06 E:0.104287 |  When the momentum, there's a little bit of the crowd over there with Burnley.
[1461.00 - 1463.00] P:1632.23 E:0.126155 |  He uses his body, blocks off Ray Nildo.
[1463.00 - 1468.00] P:1697.76 E:0.113192 |  Free kick to Sunderland just away from the left corner of their penalty area.
[1468.00 - 1475.00] P:1567.34 E:0.105805 |  Burnley-Nil, Sunderland-Nil, 20 minutes played here at Turf Moor.
[1475.00 - 1476.00] P:1759.88 E:0.109340 |  Reminder on five live sport.
[1476.00 - 1483.00] P:1713.75 E:0.102016 |  You've got the goal service from Ian Dennis as he watches Brentford leading Aston Villabyte.
[1483.00 - 1484.00] P:1828.19 E:0.097622 |  A goal to Nil.
[1484.00 - 1491.00] P:1648.14 E:0.095412 |  Sunderland with Ray Nildo head infield from this near side, the left for the black cats in this first half.
[1491.00 - 1496.00] P:1617.52 E:0.104686 |  And then it is one ball up towards the edge of the 18-yard box.
[1496.00 - 1497.00] P:1582.86 E:0.114251 |  Burnley headed away.
[1497.00 - 1499.00] P:1627.02 E:0.101159 |  Sunderland get hold of the second ball of Dingo.
[1499.00 - 1502.00] P:1806.11 E:0.105791 |  Just tries to poke it on three for Habib Diara.
[1502.00 - 1506.00] P:1737.13 E:0.105121 |  He cuts it back infield, uses Sadiqi Hadara.
[1506.00 - 1508.00] P:1756.68 E:0.129661 |  Sorry, Diara then goes down.
[1508.00 - 1510.00] P:1727.51 E:0.109611 |  And no foul given.
[1510.00 - 1511.00] P:1722.55 E:0.124301 |  Free a goal, kick to Burnley.
[1511.00 - 1513.00] P:1697.27 E:0.106215 |  The good two goes lucky, isn't he there?
[1513.00 - 1514.00] P:1574.00 E:0.117966 |  I think it's a foul.
[1514.00 - 1515.00] P:1690.65 E:0.077367 |  He pulls them back.
[1515.00 - 1520.00] P:1613.80 E:0.085886 |  Diara runs off the back of them, but again, just look at Burnley at the moment.
[1520.00 - 1524.00] P:1603.36 E:0.106921 |  They're getting a little bit overrun in midfield with that overload of three against two in there.
[1524.00 - 1528.00] P:1775.20 E:0.107754 |  And it's important that Hannibal, when he's not in possession, he drops back to help them.
[1528.00 - 1531.00] P:1776.09 E:0.092708 |  Cullin and Oogatruc were just to try and match the numbers up.
[1531.00 - 1535.00] P:1595.40 E:0.102375 |  But Sunderland, they're going really aggressive in the press.
[1535.00 - 1541.00] P:1630.21 E:0.097292 |  And, you know, the end of there now telling Talby there, can you push on?
[1541.00 - 1544.00] P:1540.26 E:0.115670 |  Can you really go and press Esteve if you can?
[1544.00 - 1549.00] P:1522.23 E:0.097130 |  But Hartman's taking them all the way back and making it a back five.
[1549.00 - 1557.00] P:1658.75 E:0.100538 |  Yeah, they were a back five against Spurs last week on paper four at the back for Scott Parker's side this afternoon.
[1557.00 - 1561.00] P:1645.46 E:0.095258 |  But when Sunderland in attack, Burnley do put numbers behind the ball.
[1561.00 - 1566.00] P:1676.25 E:0.107077 |  The Burnley side that have lost their opening home game in the Premier League in seven of the nine seasons.
[1566.00 - 1568.00] P:1532.46 E:0.093490 |  They have been in the top flight.
[1568.00 - 1570.00] P:1873.45 E:0.109706 |  They did beat Manchester United in 2009.
[1570.00 - 1574.00] P:1690.14 E:0.081498 |  They beat Southampton in 2019.
[1574.00 - 1575.00] P:1757.74 E:0.129553 |  This year doesn't end in a nine.
[1575.00 - 1578.00] P:1533.98 E:0.110286 |  So maybe they're out of luck on that one, Burnley.
[1578.00 - 1583.00] P:1753.97 E:0.099082 |  The goal is at the minute nil nil against the Sunderland side who lost the way game in the Premier League.
[1583.00 - 1586.00] P:1793.94 E:0.103523 |  It was a 5-1 loss at the then Champions Chelsea.
[1586.00 - 1588.00] P:1649.32 E:0.098819 |  Javier Mankio gave Sunderland the lead.
[1588.00 - 1589.00] P:1907.81 E:0.104063 |  They didn't lost 5-1.
[1589.00 - 1592.00] P:1772.07 E:0.102080 |  Willian equalised just five minutes after Sunderland went in front.
[1592.00 - 1598.00] P:1646.42 E:0.079532 |  A Sunderland side that featured Jordan Pickford, Jack Rodwell, Jolien Lescott,
[1598.00 - 1601.00] P:1545.99 E:0.074336 |  Jon O'Shaen, Sebastian Larsen.
[1601.00 - 1605.00] P:1517.58 E:0.088928 |  Names of yes, the year for sure.
[1605.00 - 1607.00] P:1664.03 E:0.126033 |  Sunderland in the centre circle.
[1607.00 - 1608.00] P:1424.11 E:0.114967 |  I think this Burnley...
[1608.00 - 1609.00] P:1704.56 E:0.091387 |  I know they've got...
[1609.00 - 1611.00] P:1633.14 E:0.104270 |  It looks like in the team sheet there's a back four,
[1611.00 - 1614.00] P:1711.29 E:0.089774 |  but it's actually a back five with Larsen just dropping back as they're right back.
[1614.00 - 1619.00] P:1702.99 E:0.101486 |  And Kyle Walker comes in the inside to allow him to be able to jump to the pocket player that's running.
[1619.00 - 1624.00] P:1659.67 E:0.096711 |  So it's important that, you know, they two are communicating really well and there's no crossover.
[1624.00 - 1626.00] P:1592.07 E:0.100442 |  Look at Chukwui, he's just giving the ball away.
[1626.00 - 1628.00] P:1649.31 E:0.105423 |  Burnley only had Hannibal as their furthest man forward.
[1628.00 - 1632.00] P:1737.39 E:0.109392 |  He was midway inside the Burnley half when Sunderland turned over the play initially.
[1632.00 - 1634.00] P:1660.93 E:0.080366 |  Now they're back in possession.
[1634.00 - 1636.00] P:1912.72 E:0.110031 |  The Black Cats trying to feed in.
[1636.00 - 1638.00] P:1820.50 E:0.097241 |  Siddiqui on the left of the penalty area.
[1638.00 - 1639.00] P:1808.02 E:0.110649 |  He can't, it's cleared away.
[1639.00 - 1643.00] P:1764.97 E:0.099063 |  Too many bodies back for a defensively set Burnley for now.
[1643.00 - 1647.00] P:1658.49 E:0.102986 |  They do have that impressive clean sheet record under Scott Parker.
[1647.00 - 1652.00] P:1650.05 E:0.101960 |  They don't concede many, only 16 conceded in the championship last season.
[1652.00 - 1659.00] P:1628.63 E:0.083506 |  So 19% of the goals they conceded last year came in one game against Spurs on the opening day
[1659.00 - 1661.00] P:1676.05 E:0.073475 |  in that 3-0 defeat.
[1661.00 - 1666.00] P:1739.05 E:0.103332 |  They will want to tighten up today but they also need to show some form of attacking impetus.
[1666.00 - 1671.00] P:1655.33 E:0.101550 |  They've had the ball in the back of the net, ruled it for a foul by VAR.
[1671.00 - 1673.00] P:1650.97 E:0.105822 |  Here's Ray Nildo, left-hand side.
[1673.00 - 1674.00] P:1559.51 E:0.102227 |  Sunderland come forward again.
[1674.00 - 1676.00] P:1690.65 E:0.093378 |  Midway inside, Burnley's half.
[1676.00 - 1679.00] P:1698.50 E:0.097952 |  He turns it infield from the near side touch line.
[1679.00 - 1681.00] P:1622.72 E:0.095096 |  He'll get it back in a quick one-two.
[1681.00 - 1682.00] P:1869.16 E:0.105070 |  He's played with Granite Jack of the Air.
[1682.00 - 1685.00] P:1792.47 E:0.104003 |  He's just trying to keep the play going, keep the ball moving for Sunderland.
[1685.00 - 1688.00] P:1806.01 E:0.096379 |  He gets it just away from the left corner of the penalty area.
[1688.00 - 1693.00] P:1835.60 E:0.094463 |  Gives it back out in between box and touch line for the cross that comes in from a Dinger ahead of the way.
[1693.00 - 1695.00] P:1664.15 E:0.109216 |  By Burnley, nobody really there in a black shirt to capitalise.
[1695.00 - 1699.00] P:1663.27 E:0.108413 |  Jack brings it down and then Alderete has it in the centre circle.
[1699.00 - 1701.00] P:1580.93 E:0.073698 |  Yeah, good.
[1701.00 - 1706.00] P:1724.93 E:0.104119 |  For Burnley, this formation ends up the 5-4-1 and it'll feel that you can't get out.
[1706.00 - 1709.00] P:1694.17 E:0.081636 |  But as long as you control the spaces and you've got people in there,
[1709.00 - 1712.00] P:1614.95 E:0.103817 |  like you say, allowing Kyle Walker to be able to jump or
[1712.00 - 1716.00] P:1643.23 E:0.089570 |  a Stev being able to go and get into DR or
[1716.00 - 1720.00] P:1658.25 E:0.086421 |  Sadikie into that pocket, then you can jump and then they can narrow off.
[1720.00 - 1722.00] P:1534.39 E:0.089355 |  But that's a loud last and to then drop back as the right back.
[1722.00 - 1725.00] P:1691.49 E:0.098799 |  So it's really important that they communicate really well.
[1725.00 - 1728.00] P:1689.87 E:0.102757 |  The Dinger at left-hand side goes early with the cross
[1728.00 - 1730.00] P:2023.52 E:0.098698 |  and he's drifting all the way across the 18-yard box
[1730.00 - 1733.00] P:1781.08 E:0.090808 |  and runs over towards the right-hand side.
[1733.00 - 1736.00] P:1768.28 E:0.111928 |  Trey Hume gives it a Jack, a right corner of the penalty area.
[1736.00 - 1739.00] P:1695.19 E:0.095219 |  He lays it back this time for Seelt.
[1739.00 - 1742.00] P:1752.85 E:0.089976 |  Then gives it a Jack, swings it in, head it from my end.
[1742.00 - 1747.00] P:1852.80 E:0.105345 |  While he certainly stretched for it, it goes over him and behind for a goal kick.
[1747.00 - 1751.00] P:1806.75 E:0.099989 |  25 minutes play, Burnley nil, Sunderland in, let's feel you in elsewhere.
[1751.00 - 1757.00] P:1728.42 E:0.096733 |  Bromley have equalised at Knox County in lead 2 in the Scottish Premier ship.
[1757.00 - 1760.00] P:1717.14 E:0.100102 |  Hart behind against Motherwell.
[1760.00 - 1762.00] P:1698.27 E:0.079120 |  Kilmarnock had the ball in the back of the net,
[1762.00 - 1764.00] P:1713.93 E:0.097914 |  sorry, Dundee had the ball in the back of the net,
[1764.00 - 1766.00] P:1772.27 E:0.080383 |  but that's been disallowed through VAI.
[1766.00 - 1771.00] P:1928.58 E:0.097564 |  In the Championship commentary city, turning up on QPR in League 1,
[1771.00 - 1774.00] P:1804.92 E:0.091065 |  Burton Albion had the lead at Stockport County,
[1774.00 - 1776.00] P:1699.79 E:0.090220 |  League 2 Grimsby ahead at Akrington,
[1776.00 - 1778.00] P:1858.11 E:0.095630 |  standing in the Championship.
[1778.00 - 1782.00] P:1799.29 E:0.086237 |  West Brom have just taken the lead at home to Portsmouth.
[1782.00 - 1785.00] P:1545.48 E:0.082723 |  Here, nil-nil between Burnley and Sunderland.
[1785.00 - 1789.00] P:1559.83 E:0.084354 |  Burnley's opening home game of this new Premier League season.
[1789.00 - 1793.00] P:1736.85 E:0.099692 |  And it's so far had the crowd in a little hush,
[1793.00 - 1796.00] P:1674.08 E:0.099247 |  Sunderland have started to control it a lot more of the ball.
[1796.00 - 1798.00] P:1764.16 E:0.099856 |  They're in the centre-circle at the minute,
[1798.00 - 1802.00] P:1742.59 E:0.099308 |  trying to be pushed out towards the left-hand side by Sadiqi.
[1802.00 - 1805.00] P:1768.13 E:0.110299 |  Challenged fairly, now it's Burnley's turn to attack.
[1805.00 - 1808.00] P:1713.32 E:0.094641 |  How far up the field can they get? Not very far, as in steps,
[1808.00 - 1812.00] P:1763.37 E:0.098913 |  Trachy, intercepts the ball that was running out towards the left-hand side.
[1812.00 - 1814.00] P:1742.33 E:0.106855 |  Burnley forced back into their own heart.
[1814.00 - 1817.00] P:1581.01 E:0.104184 |  Just watching Scott Parker tell his players, get B-cam on the ball.
[1817.00 - 1819.00] P:1670.19 E:0.103536 |  Can we get control of the game?
[1819.00 - 1821.00] P:1715.14 E:0.111817 |  Grannys Jacket, when he's on the ball at the moment,
[1821.00 - 1823.00] P:1750.82 E:0.097760 |  he's enjoying himself back in the Premier League,
[1823.00 - 1826.00] P:1767.36 E:0.098925 |  you know, strutting his stuff, you know, keeping it simple.
[1826.00 - 1829.00] P:1672.39 E:0.088669 |  So again, for Burnley, looking for Cullen,
[1829.00 - 1832.00] P:1660.70 E:0.097372 |  looking for a good trick, Hannibal there, giving the ball away,
[1832.00 - 1835.00] P:1616.44 E:0.073152 |  but you need these type of players to be able to get on the ball in security.
[1835.00 - 1837.00] P:1683.39 E:0.104021 |  So the team feels good about themselves,
[1837.00 - 1839.00] P:1695.76 E:0.062016 |  and now they're looking to try and get some passes.
[1839.00 - 1844.00] P:1703.88 E:0.096277 |  Yeah, I was talking about how Burnley's mentality will have to change this year.
[1844.00 - 1847.00] P:1827.30 E:0.102728 |  Such a successful season in the championship.
[1847.00 - 1850.00] P:1786.84 E:0.112007 |  The expectation was to win every game, it was to be promoted.
[1850.00 - 1853.00] P:1717.09 E:0.100052 |  Now they know this year is about survival.
[1853.00 - 1857.00] P:1712.34 E:0.088161 |  And he says the players have to understand what the journey looks like.
[1857.00 - 1860.00] P:1645.90 E:0.085778 |  Sondland have spoken amongst the fan base, amongst the media,
[1860.00 - 1862.00] P:1567.16 E:0.102035 |  that 17th is their target.
[1862.00 - 1864.00] P:1557.74 E:0.108052 |  They want another season in the Premier League,
[1864.00 - 1866.00] P:1557.34 E:0.095674 |  and for Burnley it has to be the same.
[1866.00 - 1871.00] P:1534.85 E:0.091599 |  Absolutely, and I think with Scott, I think he's more pragmatic in the understand.
[1871.00 - 1877.00] P:1675.43 E:0.083120 |  The work that's going to be needed to do to stay up in the Premier League,
[1877.00 - 1879.00] P:1551.09 E:0.078848 |  it's a different animal, isn't it, the Premier League?
[1879.00 - 1883.00] P:1742.27 E:0.080310 |  We've seen that last week for Burnley against Tottenham.
[1883.00 - 1887.00] P:1677.80 E:0.087283 |  But I think the football club will have learned from the previous experience
[1887.00 - 1889.00] P:1604.29 E:0.098501 |  under Vincent Co. in terms of the signings they made,
[1889.00 - 1891.00] P:1552.27 E:0.118236 |  and the way they're going to go.
[1891.00 - 1894.00] P:1632.37 E:0.096291 |  And they know that they're going to have to be hard to beat,
[1894.00 - 1898.00] P:1508.31 E:0.088577 |  and they're going to have to be really aggressive and defensive at times.
[1898.00 - 1902.00] P:1688.17 E:0.115240 |  And they can't be so open and exposed to the way they were the last time.
[1902.00 - 1905.00] P:1744.14 E:0.099198 |  Right now they're just crossed the ball in early from the left-hand side.
[1905.00 - 1908.00] P:1786.65 E:0.103228 |  It was looking for Diara, Diara's head.
[1908.00 - 1911.00] P:1876.88 E:0.109745 |  Didn't go in the direction he wanted, in fact, in the opposite direction,
[1911.00 - 1914.00] P:1617.90 E:0.094339 |  and went further over to the touch line, then it did closer and deeper
[1914.00 - 1915.00] P:1687.68 E:0.123074 |  into the penalty area of Burnley.
[1915.00 - 1922.00] P:1635.85 E:0.092689 |  0-0, 27.5 minutes played. Kyle Walker and Echdahl just interchanged
[1922.00 - 1924.00] P:1771.78 E:0.108525 |  some passes between themselves as Stebb gets involved.
[1924.00 - 1928.00] P:1653.26 E:0.105583 |  That's the back line complete with Hartman also getting a touch there for Burnley.
[1928.00 - 1930.00] P:1648.31 E:0.096199 |  You have this ball at walking pace,
[1930.00 - 1933.00] P:1689.80 E:0.106066 |  just slowly knocking it closer towards the edge of the centre circle.
[1933.00 - 1935.00] P:1511.32 E:0.099500 |  They're still really at the midway point of their own half.
[1935.00 - 1939.00] P:1718.91 E:0.093669 |  Hartman under a bit of pressure from Diara has to go back to his goalkeeper,
[1939.00 - 1940.00] P:1668.21 E:0.103569 |  Martin de Brouwer.
[1940.00 - 1941.00] P:1627.46 E:0.077051 |  Yeah, good build-up from Burnley.
[1941.00 - 1942.00] P:1609.81 E:0.093211 |  It really complements that.
[1942.00 - 1946.00] P:1648.93 E:0.100057 |  It's a brilliant pass from the Gautrykwa through the lines to Lyle Foster.
[1946.00 - 1952.00] P:1722.30 E:0.102164 |  And now Anthony, Jaden Anthony just trying to get Burnley deeper into the Sunderland half.
[1952.00 - 1956.00] P:1769.18 E:0.086307 |  Here's a Gautrykwa with the blonde tipped hair of his with the braids.
[1956.00 - 1960.00] P:1771.85 E:0.106969 |  And now Lyle Foster, just a little push out to the left-hand side of the box.
[1960.00 - 1963.00] P:1797.90 E:0.086479 |  But Jaden Anthony himself gets a little push in the back.
[1963.00 - 1969.00] P:1745.43 E:0.097906 |  It's all fair though for now as Burnley with Uggachukwu just play it lazily out to the left of the penalty.
[1969.00 - 1974.00] P:1749.89 E:0.107702 |  And that's the last Sunderland to get in there and pass didn't have enough on it from Uggachukwu.
[1974.00 - 1979.00] P:1663.85 E:0.090027 |  And Sunderland were able to intercept his ectal in the centre circle.
[1979.00 - 1983.00] P:1748.07 E:0.114136 |  As Burnley go again, Kyle Walker right-hand touch line, 0-0 the score.
[1983.00 - 1992.00] P:1653.97 E:0.089922 |  Nearly 29 minutes play, clips up by Hannibal looking for Foster who almost seemed to arm that into the Sunderland penalty.
[1992.00 - 1995.00] P:1748.17 E:0.110352 |  There's been another one for VAR to check if anything had come from it.
[1995.00 - 1997.00] P:1632.50 E:0.099898 |  It's a comfortable catch in the end for Robin Rees.
[1997.00 - 1999.00] P:1412.32 E:0.092038 |  Yeah, a good little play from Burnley there.
[1999.00 - 2003.00] P:1604.66 E:0.096065 |  Getting there, that pass over there for Lyle Foster actually runs past it and maybe a hits his shoulder.
[2003.00 - 2008.00] P:1603.97 E:0.097409 |  But good play from a step into Lyle Foster, bounces off and get up the pitch.
[2008.00 - 2012.00] P:1518.34 E:0.092270 |  Uggachukwu turned the ball over and the momentum sort of gone a little bit.
[2012.00 - 2019.00] P:1587.61 E:0.092789 |  Good play from Burnley again, getting into that 5-4-1, waiting on Sunderland to try and break through the press and the line.
[2019.00 - 2023.00] P:1501.38 E:0.082919 |  And then waiting for a trigger really for then Burnley to go and press.
[2023.00 - 2027.00] P:1636.37 E:0.106881 |  At Mansfield, tuning up on Leighton or in Wimbledon have the lead against Barnesley.
[2027.00 - 2032.00] P:1751.01 E:0.101872 |  Both of those in league won this afternoon and the championship key for Moore has got his second of the afternoon.
[2032.00 - 2038.00] P:1796.64 E:0.100339 |  As Wrexham leads Sheffield Wednesday, much trouble Sheffield Wednesday by two goals to nil.
[2038.00 - 2041.00] P:1637.91 E:0.102960 |  Sunderland across the centre circle from the left to the right.
[2041.00 - 2048.00] P:1668.64 E:0.091812 |  In their black shirts, shorts and socks, they are right to left in this opening 45 minutes of which quarter of an hour remains.
[2048.00 - 2059.00] P:1605.96 E:0.096779 |  Two big chances for then Burnley have had the ball in the back of the net, but it was ruled out for a foul in the build-up to that goal by Lyle Foster who scored.
[2059.00 - 2063.00] P:1653.62 E:0.083957 |  Or at least thought he'd scored and ran off celebrating some confusion.
[2063.00 - 2067.00] P:1660.21 E:0.099824 |  Hannibal certainly recognised the referee had called it as a foul immediately.
[2067.00 - 2070.00] P:1505.12 E:0.092563 |  The rest of the Burnley squad and the fans less so.
[2070.00 - 2077.00] P:1729.32 E:0.095831 |  Jacker left for it, drifting ball out towards the far side, just bounces awkwardly in front of Talby.
[2077.00 - 2081.00] P:1816.75 E:0.094206 |  His control was difficult, comes out with a throw in for his side.
[2081.00 - 2086.00] P:1525.68 E:0.079581 |  It was just an awkward bounce and it just meant he couldn't keep the momentum going.
[2086.00 - 2091.00] P:1611.60 E:0.096525 |  You know, a decent switch play from Jacker there, but Hartman was out quick there to put pressure on to Talby there.
[2091.00 - 2095.00] P:1536.40 E:0.097270 |  He didn't allow him to get his head up and he got the throw in Talby.
[2096.00 - 2104.00] P:1570.52 E:0.094664 |  Burnley are happy to have Sunday let them have the ball, getting their 5-4-1 and waiting for the trigger to then press, which we've got all told these players.
[2104.00 - 2109.00] P:1602.77 E:0.090047 |  This is the moment when we press if it's a switch or Pascal's backwards were squeezing the line.
[2109.00 - 2114.00] P:1520.48 E:0.073373 |  So it's been a decent enough start from Burnley in terms of out of position.
[2114.00 - 2118.00] P:1739.96 E:0.114341 |  Sunday were lining up the long throw, they chose to go short and now the cross does come in from the right-hand side.
[2118.00 - 2124.00] P:1879.17 E:0.107689 |  My ender got blocked off, it allows the broker to just step the yard us off his line, catch the ball in two hands.
[2124.00 - 2130.00] P:1825.51 E:0.101322 |  And he was at fault last week for the 8-second distribution, giving Spurs an early corner in that game.
[2130.00 - 2138.00] P:1708.18 E:0.104533 |  The first time we saw that rule implemented in the Premier League, he knew and he was very conscious there quickly to try and distribute the ball away from his 18-yard box.
[2138.00 - 2140.00] P:1656.97 E:0.098692 |  That's an incredible new rule, isn't it?
[2140.00 - 2141.00] P:1533.81 E:0.080839 |  Are you a fan?
[2141.00 - 2147.00] P:1600.10 E:0.075187 |  No, I don't. I think we're making rules up.
[2147.00 - 2156.00] P:1499.12 E:0.099033 |  Going away from home and you work so hard for 95-96 minutes against one of the big teams.
[2156.00 - 2162.00] P:1636.23 E:0.098379 |  Or even Arsenal going to Manchester United last week, you work so hard to get the result and something like that goes against you.
[2162.00 - 2169.00] P:1692.13 E:0.096382 |  It's incredible. They want the play to be quicker, which is fair enough, but I'm disappointed to see it.
[2169.00 - 2174.00] P:1783.57 E:0.120898 |  I think it's which side of the fence you're on, isn't it? If you're the winning team at that point, you want to hold on to it.
[2174.00 - 2175.00] P:1671.09 E:0.081389 |  Absolutely.
[2175.00 - 2180.00] P:1575.04 E:0.099468 |  If you're the losing team at that moment in time, you want to make sure you can keep the ball for as long as possible.
[2180.00 - 2181.00] P:1565.42 E:0.128414 |  Nil, Nil here.
[2181.00 - 2185.00] P:1576.89 E:0.085417 |  Turf more, mild afternoon in Lancashire.
[2185.00 - 2188.00] P:1766.17 E:0.102322 |  Hugo Chuklu has got space here, 25 yards out, left of the D.
[2188.00 - 2193.00] P:1791.90 E:0.114897 |  Took a little time to get his shot away, allowed someone to fly in with the challenge on the edge of the box.
[2193.00 - 2195.00] P:1814.80 E:0.071646 |  The ball takes a double deflection.
[2195.00 - 2198.00] P:1643.42 E:0.095853 |  I think it was sealed with the block.
[2198.00 - 2202.00] P:1687.28 E:0.089819 |  Yeah, a seal with a block, but I think it's actually a corner.
[2202.00 - 2204.00] P:1546.81 E:0.088157 |  It's a good play from Hugo Chuklu.
[2204.00 - 2207.00] P:1561.74 E:0.086540 |  Yeah, it's a corner kick.
[2207.00 - 2210.00] P:1737.95 E:0.117003 |  It's actually Alderete, wasn't it? Stretching with that left boot, yeah.
[2210.00 - 2213.00] P:1663.70 E:0.101037 |  It comes off Alderete back onto Hugo Chuklu.
[2213.00 - 2216.00] P:1698.17 E:0.096584 |  And it is a goal kick as the ball flew over the bar.
[2216.00 - 2218.00] P:1721.62 E:0.087180 |  Nil, Nil, it remains.
[2218.00 - 2222.00] P:1655.93 E:0.085022 |  Sunland use seal with the goal kick this time.
[2222.00 - 2225.00] P:1826.71 E:0.108312 |  It plays it short to Robin Rooster then himself, gives it back to seal.
[2225.00 - 2230.00] P:1795.80 E:0.105042 |  And Sunland are looking forward. It's a good little push of the shoulder from Diara to create himself some space
[2230.00 - 2232.00] P:1832.00 E:0.098187 |  and shrug off the Burnley challenge.
[2232.00 - 2235.00] P:1880.82 E:0.091227 |  Now a ding-a-doh with that little blonde streak in his hair.
[2235.00 - 2237.00] P:1787.70 E:0.100738 |  Runs into a bit of traffic.
[2237.00 - 2239.00] P:1844.30 E:0.099036 |  Ball ricochets back to Ray Nildo.
[2239.00 - 2242.00] P:1767.97 E:0.088911 |  And now out towards this left-hand side for Sadiqi.
[2242.00 - 2243.00] P:1599.08 E:0.110248 |  Ray Nildo involved again.
[2243.00 - 2248.00] P:1624.38 E:0.103179 |  A little bit of triangular passing for Sunland involving Granite Jacker as well.
[2248.00 - 2252.00] P:1817.49 E:0.096468 |  Right footed curling ball in, looking for the run off Sadiqi.
[2252.00 - 2256.00] P:1722.83 E:0.101949 |  Burnley have to be careful inside their own six yard box here with Kyle Walker.
[2256.00 - 2259.00] P:1775.54 E:0.113854 |  Wrapping a right boot around the ball, getting it up towards the halfway line.
[2259.00 - 2263.00] P:1765.45 E:0.095958 |  Sunderland will be first to it, but themselves in sending back into Burnley territory,
[2263.00 - 2267.00] P:1749.07 E:0.107102 |  give it away, but then Soda Burnley and Sunderland in possession again.
[2269.00 - 2271.00] P:1533.69 E:0.104447 |  Adingra has the ball.
[2271.00 - 2278.00] P:1713.64 E:0.085435 |  Now Diara, the VAR decision on Lyle Foster's goal, and it's been flashed up on the big screen.
[2278.00 - 2282.00] P:1882.29 E:0.097968 |  The referee's called for no goal following the foul by Foster on Seelt was checked
[2282.00 - 2288.00] P:1666.02 E:0.091104 |  and confirmed by VAR, it reads, with it deemed that Seelt was clearly tripped from behind.
[2288.00 - 2290.00] P:1723.27 E:0.092359 |  That's good, I like that.
[2290.00 - 2294.00] P:1617.95 E:0.099367 |  At least the referees gave it to the explicit nation, and they've come out,
[2294.00 - 2296.00] P:1685.05 E:0.085762 |  and the fans can now see the reasons why.
[2296.00 - 2298.00] P:1566.06 E:0.109553 |  Like anything, some fans will agree, some don't.
[2298.00 - 2303.00] P:1538.50 E:0.095010 |  But no, I think it's good, clear information where the decision was made.
[2303.00 - 2307.00] P:1590.31 E:0.098068 |  But again, I like that sort of three in midfield of Sunderland at the moment.
[2307.00 - 2312.00] P:1684.38 E:0.098234 |  The Sadiq with Diara and Jacke, experienced player, but he's got good energy,
[2312.00 - 2315.00] P:1751.14 E:0.101531 |  good legs next to him where they can go and get after the ball for the team
[2315.00 - 2317.00] P:1739.47 E:0.106389 |  and really be aggressive in the press.
[2317.00 - 2320.00] P:1574.97 E:0.102523 |  But this time, we're Burnley being able to play through them.
[2320.00 - 2322.00] P:1724.60 E:0.113557 |  Maybe they can do the same now.
[2322.00 - 2324.00] P:1877.38 E:0.115905 |  The Clarrits starting to play out towards the right-hand side.
[2324.00 - 2328.00] P:1620.06 E:0.100440 |  Jackel Brun Larson, number seven on his back, lays it back to Kyle Walker.
[2328.00 - 2330.00] P:1738.30 E:0.081456 |  Quick one-two between him and Uggachukwu.
[2330.00 - 2333.00] P:1757.99 E:0.108622 |  Now Brun Larson continues his run on the right-hand side.
[2333.00 - 2336.00] P:1745.06 E:0.106793 |  The crosses in towards the back post, trying to race onto it.
[2336.00 - 2341.00] P:1864.94 E:0.104662 |  Was Kylinsi Hartman who couldn't get that, and it goes out of play for a Sunderland throw, Nil Nel?
[2341.00 - 2344.00] P:1742.07 E:0.092830 |  Yeah, decent play from Burnley there again.
[2344.00 - 2348.00] P:1553.57 E:0.097960 |  Walker plays one-two and then Sliden and Brun Larson.
[2348.00 - 2353.00] P:1620.27 E:0.102038 |  But again, Hartman, just too late there and the ball goes out for the throw in.
[2353.00 - 2357.00] P:1541.31 E:0.093342 |  But a good little interplay from Burnley and let's say,
[2357.00 - 2360.00] P:1625.69 E:0.100461 |  hopefully they can start asking more of that back line in Sunderland.
[2360.00 - 2364.00] P:1732.84 E:0.100248 |  In Lee too, not to County. Back in front against Bromley, Stockport County, down to ten.
[2364.00 - 2369.00] P:1776.60 E:0.107362 |  Brad Hills has only just signed for the club after a loan spell last season from Norwich.
[2369.00 - 2372.00] P:1815.59 E:0.094898 |  He's been sent off at Edgeley Park.
[2372.00 - 2376.00] P:1831.67 E:0.106729 |  Bristol Rovers, lead Cambridge United by a goal to Nil in league two.
[2376.00 - 2381.00] P:1824.44 E:0.103802 |  In the championship commentary, City have got a third against struggling QPR.
[2381.00 - 2384.00] P:1788.33 E:0.102889 |  That brings you up to date on five sports extra.
[2384.00 - 2387.00] P:1799.38 E:0.110000 |  Half-time will be joining five live sport in the team.
[2387.00 - 2392.00] P:1745.96 E:0.102836 |  Mark Chapman in the team to take you round the grounds and give you all the latest from the Premier League and the Football League.
[2392.00 - 2394.00] P:1880.89 E:0.111509 |  Nil-Nil here with ten minutes to half-time.
[2394.00 - 2400.00] P:1678.61 E:0.085346 |  Burnley have a free-kick on the left-hand side, which Josh Cullen is over.
[2400.00 - 2402.00] P:1747.83 E:0.108023 |  It won't be one that's sent into the penalty area.
[2402.00 - 2406.00] P:1605.66 E:0.100924 |  It's only ten yards or so inside the Sunderland half and it's not back into Burnley's half anyway.
[2406.00 - 2410.00] P:1754.72 E:0.102596 |  The job that Josh Cullen actually does for Burnley has been incredible.
[2410.00 - 2414.00] P:1510.01 E:0.092707 |  Over the last number of years he's been here.
[2414.00 - 2419.00] P:1663.80 E:0.104502 |  The little sicking balls he picks up, getting fouls, always being the right place at the right time.
[2419.00 - 2422.00] P:1670.58 E:0.085416 |  He keeps the ball moving for the team.
[2422.00 - 2428.00] P:1460.41 E:0.102258 |  It was instrumental in terms of when Vincent, the company, was one of his first signs he'd come in because he'd worked with him at Anderlecht.
[2428.00 - 2431.00] P:1551.36 E:0.093056 |  A young player coming through at West Ham, but wonderful footballer.
[2431.00 - 2435.00] P:1560.83 E:0.100920 |  Being able to get on the ball, control the game, but leads by example.
[2435.00 - 2438.00] P:1575.00 E:0.086720 |  That's ultimately why he's become the captain of the football club.
[2438.00 - 2445.00] P:1604.73 E:0.102921 |  You don't realise that you go into the radar of these type of players that go and get your fouls and get you up the pitch and drive your team forward.
[2445.00 - 2448.00] P:1685.54 E:0.091325 |  He'll be a big player for Burnley this year again.
[2448.00 - 2452.00] P:1639.42 E:0.112241 |  Ten years since his Premier League debut, Josh Cullen, when he was a West Ham player.
[2452.00 - 2456.00] P:1640.81 E:0.094458 |  A 3-0 win at Anfield against Liverpool.
[2456.00 - 2461.00] P:1794.31 E:0.103310 |  Tasted victory over Sunderland in the playoffs before when he was at Charlton as well.
[2461.00 - 2466.00] P:1652.13 E:0.122823 |  In the League 1 campaign that someone had to wait another year in the third tier of English football.
[2466.00 - 2469.00] P:1748.89 E:0.089505 |  Here they are, back in the top flight after an eight-year absence.
[2469.00 - 2472.00] P:1671.88 E:0.092763 |  Impressive start last week at home in West Ham.
[2472.00 - 2475.00] P:1536.42 E:0.095476 |  Now can they back it up against Burnley this afternoon?
[2475.00 - 2480.00] P:1794.58 E:0.091181 |  Mill-Nill the score. Coventry City have now got a fourth against QPR.
[2480.00 - 2484.00] P:1714.11 E:0.108846 |  Mansfield have been pegged back by Leighton Orient 2-1.
[2484.00 - 2491.00] P:1715.97 E:0.095736 |  They're Sheffield United struggling at the foot of the championship table, yet to win under Reuben Sellers.
[2491.00 - 2495.00] P:1550.04 E:0.090394 |  They're 1-0 down at home to Millwall as well.
[2495.00 - 2497.00] P:1852.09 E:0.090842 |  So that keeps you up to date.
[2497.00 - 2499.00] P:1810.17 E:0.123367 |  Here's a good chukku with a bit of space to run forward in.
[2499.00 - 2504.00] P:1797.80 E:0.106241 |  I don't think you realise it at first, but now it gets Burnley up towards the halfway line inside the centre circle.
[2504.00 - 2509.00] P:1691.57 E:0.099145 |  The Clarrits left to right in this opening 45 minutes, which eight minutes remain.
[2509.00 - 2511.00] P:1720.26 E:0.113205 |  Paul passed down the right from Brun Larson.
[2511.00 - 2514.00] P:1889.28 E:0.100397 |  He holds up a hand in apology to Hannibal.
[2514.00 - 2517.00] P:1643.76 E:0.099810 |  And that will be a Sunderland throw midway inside their own half.
[2517.00 - 2521.00] P:1565.76 E:0.081285 |  Yeah, again, disappointing there from Brun Larson just giving the ball away.
[2521.00 - 2525.00] P:1468.65 E:0.100035 |  But good battle there between Alderet and Hannibal.
[2525.00 - 2528.00] P:1593.54 E:0.090164 |  Just really nitty, gritty against each other.
[2528.00 - 2532.00] P:1473.17 E:0.094325 |  Looking to try and fight and scrap and make it horrible for each other.
[2532.00 - 2539.00] P:1516.50 E:0.102592 |  But it's been a good game for Nevenos now, two teams having a go, still wanting to go forward.
[2539.00 - 2542.00] P:1517.22 E:0.107509 |  And Sunderland haven't sat back as their way team.
[2542.00 - 2545.00] P:1558.41 E:0.098696 |  Burnley have tried to get after Sunderland as the home team.
[2545.00 - 2548.00] P:1492.93 E:0.079697 |  So it's been decent enough entertainment.
[2548.00 - 2553.00] P:1664.36 E:0.082081 |  Some of those fans heading for their half-time refreshments in the Burnley end anyway.
[2553.00 - 2558.00] P:1700.89 E:0.100530 |  The Sunderland fans were a moment ago had their hands clapping above their heads
[2558.00 - 2561.00] P:1751.47 E:0.106862 |  as their team turned it out towards the right-hand side.
[2561.00 - 2568.00] P:1753.96 E:0.092077 |  Both managers sat down in their dugout for now as Sunderland come forward with a little bit of space for Diara to operate.
[2568.00 - 2570.00] P:1793.80 E:0.110570 |  And he's waiting for the overlap as well.
[2570.00 - 2576.00] P:1671.71 E:0.084930 |  The low cross comes in from the right-hand side, cut off at source by Maxime Estève.
[2576.00 - 2580.00] P:1677.10 E:0.097088 |  His jacket, looking for that run that he finds out on the right-hand side.
[2580.00 - 2583.00] P:1799.02 E:0.100181 |  Hume will take a touch this time, crosses it in right foot.
[2583.00 - 2586.00] P:1711.78 E:0.100557 |  It arcs away from the players in the black shirts as Sunderland though in Mayende.
[2586.00 - 2590.00] P:1691.06 E:0.097961 |  It was well past him and it arc behind Seaman Odinger as well.
[2590.00 - 2594.00] P:1838.77 E:0.108653 |  Here's Alderete under a bit of pressure from Hannibal who is looking sharp.
[2594.00 - 2596.00] P:1763.28 E:0.106864 |  Looks like he's up for a battle this afternoon, Hannibal.
[2596.00 - 2597.00] P:1812.93 E:0.113966 |  It has to be said.
[2597.00 - 2601.00] P:1880.83 E:0.104453 |  Yeah, absolutely. That's what he is. I think he's a very good player.
[2601.00 - 2604.00] P:1695.83 E:0.106673 |  But he likes to get in amongst it and he wants to get in about people.
[2604.00 - 2608.00] P:1581.17 E:0.086247 |  And there again Alderete gave him a chance, didn't he, to try and nick it.
[2608.00 - 2613.00] P:1580.74 E:0.094876 |  But it's been a good battle between the two and Cal Walker using experience there when the cross comes in.
[2613.00 - 2618.00] P:1523.95 E:0.103858 |  He just nudged Odinger out the way and the ball goes through the pitch there again.
[2618.00 - 2621.00] P:1786.30 E:0.104774 |  Hannibal and Alderete hit it again.
[2621.00 - 2625.00] P:1823.13 E:0.109869 |  This time Hannibal just cranes his neck very quickly, very reactionary.
[2625.00 - 2630.00] P:1556.16 E:0.098868 |  And it heads it out for a Sunderland throwing on the halfway line near side.
[2630.00 - 2632.00] P:1540.51 E:0.097196 |  There left as we look at it.
[2632.00 - 2635.00] P:1747.70 E:0.103990 |  Hannibal just had a little few words to Alderete.
[2635.00 - 2638.00] P:1792.03 E:0.110728 |  Yeah, he's just trying to wind them up. He's just trying to come on then.
[2638.00 - 2639.00] P:1432.18 E:0.068571 |  Let's go. What have you got?
[2639.00 - 2642.00] P:1630.78 E:0.079830 |  You know, it's good. I think I like that.
[2642.00 - 2646.00] P:1652.32 E:0.090201 |  You want to try and what you're trying to do is get an advantage over your opponent.
[2646.00 - 2651.00] P:1655.89 E:0.106444 |  Can he handle that? Can he lose concentration for that moment that may give the opportunity?
[2651.00 - 2653.00] P:1665.10 E:0.113619 |  Mayenda sent through on the right-hand side.
[2653.00 - 2658.00] P:1685.69 E:0.105553 |  It comes after Cullen played a pass back that bounced off a step and then into Sunderland possession.
[2658.00 - 2662.00] P:1742.90 E:0.101779 |  Mayenda right-hand side, close to the byline goes down.
[2662.00 - 2664.00] P:1758.08 E:0.094440 |  No foul given.
[2664.00 - 2667.00] P:1826.33 E:0.116494 |  He did have half a look towards the referee who's just got an arm out here to say,
[2667.00 - 2669.00] P:1689.31 E:0.099371 |  hold on, we'll check for a possible penalty.
[2669.00 - 2670.00] P:1839.41 E:0.106400 |  Burnley might have a goal kick.
[2670.00 - 2672.00] P:1795.42 E:0.083722 |  Yeah, Mayenda's gone far too easy there.
[2672.00 - 2678.00] P:1606.50 E:0.087725 |  He's tried to buy the penalty there, but it's definitely not a penalty.
[2678.00 - 2682.00] P:1752.50 E:0.104863 |  The referee has retreated away from the 18-yard box,
[2682.00 - 2685.00] P:1684.47 E:0.099775 |  and it was a stab who collided with Mayenda.
[2685.00 - 2690.00] P:1737.00 E:0.108854 |  Nothing in it for Charlie Adam, nothing in it for the VAR officials either.
[2690.00 - 2695.00] P:1596.39 E:0.091572 |  John Brooks assisted by Gary Bezik this afternoon in Stockley Park.
[2695.00 - 2698.00] P:1681.44 E:0.113620 |  Head of forward over the halfway line from Sunderland.
[2698.00 - 2700.00] P:1583.33 E:0.092005 |  It comes back into their territory though.
[2700.00 - 2701.00] P:1561.18 E:0.092205 |  Hannibal on the chase.
[2701.00 - 2705.00] P:1780.54 E:0.099443 |  Alderette stabs it away back into the Burnley half.
[2705.00 - 2711.00] P:1734.20 E:0.092966 |  Jay Nantini on the stretch on the halfway line to try and control that pace of all,
[2711.00 - 2714.00] P:1587.64 E:0.096029 |  and it runs out for another Sunderland throw.
[2714.00 - 2716.00] P:1679.69 E:0.099635 |  Burnley nil, Sunderland nil.
[2716.00 - 2722.00] P:1628.02 E:0.083989 |  Burnley had 16, sorry, 11 nil-nil draws last year in the championship.
[2722.00 - 2727.00] P:1549.95 E:0.091526 |  It was nil-nil between this pair when they met in the second tier of English football.
[2727.00 - 2728.00] P:1912.35 E:0.096017 |  Burnley going up automatically.
[2728.00 - 2731.00] P:1659.61 E:0.078525 |  Sunderland had to do it by the playoffs,
[2731.00 - 2736.00] P:1632.57 E:0.087889 |  and they're enjoying life back in England's top flight after a game and a half.
[2736.00 - 2737.00] P:1847.20 E:0.095889 |  An incredible standard, wasn't it,
[2737.00 - 2740.00] P:1637.54 E:0.104406 |  with the top two really last year leads in Burnley?
[2740.00 - 2745.00] P:1605.34 E:0.098565 |  Over 100 points, and for Sunderland to be so far ahead within the playoffs
[2745.00 - 2749.00] P:1603.80 E:0.089382 |  to probably last six weeks of the season,
[2749.00 - 2751.00] P:1686.13 E:0.110030 |  fell away a little bit and everybody was saying,
[2751.00 - 2753.00] P:1640.26 E:0.101598 |  is that going to be the end for Sunderland?
[2753.00 - 2755.00] P:1674.93 E:0.094761 |  But the manager and the players, they picked themselves up
[2756.00 - 2759.00] P:1672.53 E:0.097594 |  and did a brilliant job to get through the playoffs.
[2759.00 - 2762.00] P:1699.84 E:0.089019 |  It's been eight years since they've been to Premier League,
[2762.00 - 2767.00] P:1673.16 E:0.089693 |  and they've been through a lot of issues through the years, haven't they,
[2767.00 - 2770.00] P:1659.48 E:0.097587 |  over that eight years as well with different owners than that,
[2770.00 - 2771.00] P:1535.50 E:0.115103 |  but they look like they've got a good owner now.
[2771.00 - 2774.00] P:1794.72 E:0.117158 |  Might get a bit of joy, the long-range shot from 20 yards out,
[2774.00 - 2779.00] P:1813.71 E:0.093726 |  low-driven, wide-of-the-right hand post from Granite Jacket,
[2779.00 - 2781.00] P:1728.95 E:0.111446 |  who shakes his head as he walks away.
[2781.00 - 2784.00] P:1822.33 E:0.094709 |  He knows he should have hit that cleaner, hit that better
[2784.00 - 2788.00] P:1586.17 E:0.089801 |  from the edge of the penalty area on the right of the D,
[2788.00 - 2790.00] P:1647.55 E:0.102839 |  drives it low, well wider the right hand post.
[2790.00 - 2792.00] P:1787.45 E:0.080544 |  Yeah, he's dragged it there, Granite Jacket.
[2792.00 - 2794.00] P:1482.45 E:0.107981 |  You'd expect him to do better, the quality he has,
[2794.00 - 2797.00] P:1599.54 E:0.089571 |  and it's just dragged as it come over his body.
[2797.00 - 2800.00] P:1788.97 E:0.109047 |  Birmingham 1-0 up at home to Oxford United in the Champions League,
[2800.00 - 2803.00] P:1723.26 E:0.106279 |  in League 1, Reading have got an equaliser at Wickham Wanderers,
[2803.00 - 2804.00] P:1595.00 E:0.102670 |  a little bit of a derby.
[2804.00 - 2807.00] P:1877.46 E:0.089142 |  That commentary now have five in the first half against QPR,
[2807.00 - 2809.00] P:1753.56 E:0.116335 |  Jack Radoni with the goal there,
[2809.00 - 2812.00] P:1719.93 E:0.085444 |  and Norwich City behind against Millsborough,
[2812.00 - 2816.00] P:1692.62 E:0.098968 |  who had won three from three at the start of the championship.
[2816.00 - 2818.00] P:1576.92 E:0.107035 |  Season, they now lead.
[2818.00 - 2821.00] P:1728.27 E:0.096180 |  Older Athletic have equalised at Fleetwood Town.
[2821.00 - 2823.00] P:1675.83 E:0.075257 |  So it's 1-1 there in League 2.
[2823.00 - 2828.00] P:1728.21 E:0.098433 |  0-0 here with a little over two minutes of the first 45 remaining.
[2828.00 - 2830.00] P:1570.26 E:0.099791 |  Can't imagine we'll have too much added time.
[2830.00 - 2834.00] P:1630.71 E:0.074606 |  Few VAR checks will give us maybe a couple of minutes.
[2834.00 - 2837.00] P:1567.82 E:0.093879 |  Sunderland in possession, in control.
[2837.00 - 2839.00] P:1702.59 E:0.106138 |  Large amounts of possession in this game.
[2839.00 - 2841.00] P:1703.12 E:0.090206 |  They've had the two best chances as well,
[2841.00 - 2843.00] P:1662.36 E:0.112036 |  two best legal chances.
[2843.00 - 2845.00] P:1475.04 E:0.085746 |  Burnley had the ball in the back of the net that was ruled out.
[2845.00 - 2848.00] P:1619.51 E:0.096212 |  If you want to listen back to that Lyall Foster chance,
[2848.00 - 2849.00] P:1691.46 E:0.105150 |  you can.
[2849.00 - 2853.00] P:1577.80 E:0.094609 |  BBC Sounds app is the place you can do that.
[2853.00 - 2855.00] P:1515.16 E:0.085298 |  This season, five live sports extra.
[2855.00 - 2860.00] P:1684.90 E:0.091350 |  BBC Sounds going to bring you over 200 Premier League games.
[2860.00 - 2863.00] P:1678.30 E:0.108519 |  Arsenal leads, comes at 5.30 on five live sport.
[2863.00 - 2865.00] P:1802.32 E:0.103569 |  Everton's first match in their new stadium on Sunday,
[2865.00 - 2868.00] P:1684.35 E:0.085500 |  followed by Fulham against Manchester United.
[2868.00 - 2870.00] P:1834.81 E:0.110461 |  It goes beyond the live games as well.
[2870.00 - 2874.00] P:1772.77 E:0.096112 |  The Wayne Rooney show drops every Friday and every Monday.
[2874.00 - 2878.00] P:1638.71 E:0.087338 |  With Kelly Summers and Kay Curd on hand to discuss the big stories
[2878.00 - 2882.00] P:1573.67 E:0.097285 |  alongside the former England captain and former Manchester United man,
[2882.00 - 2884.00] P:1507.85 E:0.073549 |  Wayne Rooney.
[2884.00 - 2887.00] P:1746.29 E:0.113728 |  And we're also at the start of the Women's Rugby World Cup as well.
[2887.00 - 2888.00] P:1557.91 E:0.085594 |  That got underway last night.
[2888.00 - 2889.00] P:1686.90 E:0.084180 |  Big win for England.
[2889.00 - 2892.00] P:1923.17 E:0.083074 |  Australia would have followed that up this lunchtime.
[2892.00 - 2896.00] P:1670.93 E:0.098674 |  You can follow all the games on BBC Sports.
[2896.00 - 2900.00] P:1723.03 E:0.095192 |  I mean, it's a half-time of normal time anyway.
[2900.00 - 2903.00] P:1688.22 E:0.106764 |  And Burnley with the brokering side, he's six-yard boxy-rolled it.
[2903.00 - 2906.00] P:1701.70 E:0.099290 |  Low and short to Kyle Walker inside the penalty area.
[2906.00 - 2907.00] P:1571.37 E:0.105448 |  Now has to hack it long.
[2907.00 - 2911.00] P:1780.14 E:0.111392 |  Granite Jacker into sets, then stealing him from behind his Jaden Anthony.
[2911.00 - 2915.00] P:1712.94 E:0.109274 |  Burnley set themselves forward here with Hannibal on the right-hand side.
[2915.00 - 2917.00] P:1877.22 E:0.097436 |  Can they end the first half strongly?
[2917.00 - 2920.00] P:1826.00 E:0.105129 |  Players over on the left, if Hannibal can see it, he's not.
[2920.00 - 2922.00] P:1900.60 E:0.103546 |  They win the ball back though from Sunderland's interception.
[2922.00 - 2925.00] P:1815.20 E:0.097843 |  Here's Brun Larson, corner of the penalty area right-hand side.
[2925.00 - 2929.00] P:1719.19 E:0.076981 |  Right foot across, he's headed away by Silt.
[2929.00 - 2933.00] P:1471.60 E:0.109099 |  And it's up towards the halfway line, Burnley with a step, knocking back to De Broca.
[2933.00 - 2935.00] P:1743.40 E:0.085528 |  Yeah, again, Burnley good play in there.
[2935.00 - 2939.00] P:1720.11 E:0.091275 |  Jacker taking his time, not seeing that the Lyle Foster is actually behind them.
[2939.00 - 2944.00] P:1566.06 E:0.091995 |  They're taking a poor touch on Lyle Foster, nipping in, but Burnley getting up the pitch there.
[2944.00 - 2950.00] P:1732.78 E:0.096007 |  And let's say finishing half at a decent level and half-time just coming now.
[2950.00 - 2951.00] P:1949.93 E:0.120682 |  Two quick goals for Reading.
[2951.00 - 2953.00] P:1727.69 E:0.101151 |  So they're now two-one up at Wickham in League One.
[2953.00 - 2955.00] P:1841.70 E:0.106894 |  And two quick goals for Middlesbrough.
[2955.00 - 2959.00] P:1919.36 E:0.102673 |  Tommy Conway scored in the championship, so they're two-nil up away at Norwich.
[2959.00 - 2963.00] P:1713.78 E:0.100240 |  All the half-times coming in will be joining Mark Chapman and the team over on five live sport
[2963.00 - 2965.00] P:1788.03 E:0.100633 |  when we hit the break here.
[2965.00 - 2969.00] P:1848.51 E:0.087347 |  But we've got four minutes of added time to go first.
[2969.00 - 2975.00] P:1644.97 E:0.081895 |  Can anyone head into the tunnel at half-time with a lead?
[2975.00 - 2982.00] P:1549.44 E:0.084762 |  And these games tight between Burnley and Sunderland as they have been throughout their recent games.
[2983.00 - 2986.00] P:1597.54 E:0.097583 |  Might just be going the same way.
[2986.00 - 2991.00] P:1678.99 E:0.091319 |  The last time these two met in the Premier League was 2016-17 season.
[2991.00 - 2993.00] P:1808.55 E:0.109367 |  Both were relegated that season.
[2993.00 - 2995.00] P:1600.67 E:0.081589 |  Burnley won 4-1 here at Turfmort.
[2995.00 - 2998.00] P:1770.19 E:0.090753 |  Andre Grey-Hatrick, Ashley Barnes scored the fourth.
[2998.00 - 3001.00] P:1625.91 E:0.107233 |  Sunderland's consolation came through Jermaine Defoe.
[3001.00 - 3004.00] P:1677.31 E:0.096908 |  Here's a Dingerer left-hand side for Sunderland just cantering closer to the penalty.
[3004.00 - 3007.00] P:1742.83 E:0.091611 |  He now tries the reverse pass through.
[3007.00 - 3009.00] P:1663.62 E:0.091664 |  Doesn't quite work out.
[3009.00 - 3010.00] P:1776.55 E:0.101919 |  They'll get a second bite this Sunderland.
[3010.00 - 3015.00] P:1695.44 E:0.095590 |  This one's a deep across that is trying to be controlled in one sweeping motion
[3015.00 - 3017.00] P:1750.08 E:0.105932 |  and pass through the Mayender unsuccessfully.
[3017.00 - 3021.00] P:1625.16 E:0.100102 |  So they'll come back out towards the left-hand side for Reynildo Short.
[3021.00 - 3024.00] P:1715.80 E:0.101797 |  Passed ten yards or so further forward for a Dingerer.
[3024.00 - 3029.00] P:1716.69 E:0.099225 |  Jacke tries to get involved, clatters into Jaden Antony.
[3029.00 - 3032.00] P:1704.05 E:0.097872 |  He's actually tried to header the ball on the floor there, Jacke,
[3032.00 - 3036.00] P:1895.40 E:0.103485 |  but just showing what he wants to do and put his body on the line.
[3036.00 - 3038.00] P:1574.92 E:0.111234 |  It'd have been easy for him to step by a lever, Cousin,
[3038.00 - 3041.00] P:1579.86 E:0.100958 |  and playing in the Bundesliga,
[3041.00 - 3046.00] P:1610.27 E:0.093501 |  but to come to a relegation battle really, isn't it, for Sunderland so far.
[3046.00 - 3049.00] P:1675.19 E:0.089443 |  Hopefully this year it could possibly be,
[3049.00 - 3051.00] P:1462.35 E:0.094282 |  but I think they've invested well,
[3051.00 - 3053.00] P:1759.95 E:0.089348 |  but he feels like the project is good for him.
[3053.00 - 3055.00] P:1706.15 E:0.104050 |  And again, a good experience in there.
[3055.00 - 3057.00] P:1567.26 E:0.101151 |  I think he'd be a good leader in there.
[3057.00 - 3060.00] P:1570.65 E:0.082310 |  And they all have learned from his past experience of being at Arsenal
[3060.00 - 3063.00] P:1528.51 E:0.101721 |  and the problems he had sometimes on the pitch.
[3063.00 - 3065.00] P:1577.25 E:0.098039 |  He's got to lead this group now.
[3065.00 - 3068.00] P:1644.79 E:0.104567 |  He's got to be the one that everybody can rely on.
[3068.00 - 3072.00] P:1621.72 E:0.081870 |  He could be at the forefront of everything that they do in the Premier League this year.
[3072.00 - 3077.00] P:1630.55 E:0.107416 |  Rangelye Lebris said that he decided Jacke was going to be the captain of Sunderland
[3077.00 - 3079.00] P:1697.79 E:0.098602 |  within ten minutes of seeing him in training.
[3079.00 - 3083.00] P:1578.41 E:0.094267 |  He said he knew very quickly that Jacke was the man from the midfield
[3083.00 - 3085.00] P:1707.37 E:0.092557 |  to help Sunderland in this fight this season.
[3085.00 - 3087.00] P:1720.75 E:0.111744 |  All I was saying, that they do win this afternoon.
[3087.00 - 3089.00] P:1696.39 E:0.099714 |  They'll be top of the Premier League with two wins from two.
[3089.00 - 3094.00] P:1706.37 E:0.090890 |  Alongside Spurs who beat Manchester City earlier 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium.
[3094.00 - 3098.00] P:1641.81 E:0.094100 |  So City's 100% record goes.
[3098.00 - 3101.00] P:1749.72 E:0.072344 |  Liverpool, of course, could follow.
[3101.00 - 3103.00] P:1536.69 E:0.103765 |  Cracker on Monday night as well.
[3103.00 - 3107.00] P:1811.73 E:0.117045 |  Two wins from two, yeah. Newcastle with all the stories of EZAC going around as well.
[3107.00 - 3109.00] P:1948.31 E:0.103918 |  EZAC won't be involved in that game,
[3109.00 - 3113.00] P:1691.03 E:0.087436 |  whether he has any future involvement in Newcastle will wait to be seen.
[3113.00 - 3115.00] P:1776.36 E:0.110575 |  Burnley in the centre-circle here.
[3115.00 - 3119.00] P:1631.83 E:0.086857 |  A world away from 110 million pound signings.
[3119.00 - 3121.00] P:1749.40 E:0.093040 |  Walker, who cost five million.
[3121.00 - 3123.00] P:1618.51 E:0.091126 |  On the right of the centre-circle, switch it across.
[3123.00 - 3124.00] P:1869.56 E:0.104518 |  Here's a stab.
[3124.00 - 3127.00] P:1609.73 E:0.091360 |  We have a little over a minute remaining of the first half added time.
[3127.00 - 3130.00] P:1703.41 E:0.108252 |  Four minutes were shown. We've nearly had three of those.
[3130.00 - 3132.00] P:1718.04 E:0.099535 |  Foster chased it down by the corner flag on the far side.
[3132.00 - 3135.00] P:1620.54 E:0.084363 |  Lays it back to Antony.
[3135.00 - 3139.00] P:1582.46 E:0.079076 |  Cullen just turns back out towards that far side.
[3139.00 - 3148.00] P:1637.72 E:0.073335 |  Hartman loses out under pressure from Trey Huw in that far corner.
[3148.00 - 3150.00] P:1683.67 E:0.103509 |  Burnley's left hand side.
[3150.00 - 3153.00] P:1827.81 E:0.102514 |  A little slip there from Josh Cullen, who thinks he was tripped.
[3153.00 - 3154.00] P:1867.91 E:0.103108 |  It looked more of a slip to me.
[3154.00 - 3157.00] P:1677.47 E:0.105138 |  He suddenly had it back, just knocking into their own penalty area.
[3157.00 - 3160.00] P:1649.71 E:0.090359 |  The ball dead at the feet of Jensen Silt.
[3160.00 - 3164.00] P:1687.08 E:0.113375 |  Hannibal wins it back though as it's played out towards the far side touch line.
[3164.00 - 3166.00] P:1898.69 E:0.111546 |  Now he's on a charge through into the penalty area,
[3166.00 - 3170.00] P:1798.97 E:0.103574 |  but the ball got stuck close to his feet and he couldn't feed it through for Lyall Foster.
[3170.00 - 3172.00] P:1707.60 E:0.107466 |  Suddenly give it away again though.
[3172.00 - 3173.00] P:1866.85 E:0.111709 |  Burnley pressure.
[3173.00 - 3175.00] P:1736.81 E:0.085007 |  Walker on the right hand side.
[3175.00 - 3179.00] P:1816.73 E:0.098678 |  Let's the ball run across his body and then out towards the near side touch line
[3179.00 - 3180.00] P:1789.93 E:0.094874 |  for Jacob Brun Larson.
[3180.00 - 3182.00] P:1822.42 E:0.076154 |  Here's Jay Nantini.
[3182.00 - 3184.00] P:1796.96 E:0.108010 |  Most of this half spent on the left hand side.
[3184.00 - 3186.00] P:1723.25 E:0.079138 |  He's now operating down the middle.
[3186.00 - 3189.00] P:1723.90 E:0.082905 |  Can Burnley find the shot with only seconds remaining?
[3189.00 - 3191.00] P:1809.37 E:0.098019 |  In next first half, Nil Nil.
[3191.00 - 3194.00] P:1659.22 E:0.085142 |  Cullen down the middle uses Hannibal.
[3194.00 - 3197.00] P:1647.56 E:0.109569 |  Hannibal just plays it back towards the edge of the centre circle.
[3197.00 - 3200.00] P:1820.19 E:0.101999 |  Burnley don't look in a rush here to get this ball into the penalty area.
[3200.00 - 3201.00] P:1812.39 E:0.100133 |  Now it's the long ball forward.
[3201.00 - 3203.00] P:1816.50 E:0.098515 |  Hannibal will challenge with Alberetta.
[3203.00 - 3206.00] P:1745.82 E:0.099713 |  Ball runs on through to Brun Larson on the right hand side.
[3206.00 - 3207.00] P:1682.68 E:0.114081 |  Hannibal on the overlap.
[3207.00 - 3208.00] P:1724.79 E:0.088185 |  Flicks the ball around him.
[3208.00 - 3212.00] P:1805.25 E:0.109108 |  Left foot he crosses towards the back post and the header is wide.
[3212.00 - 3214.00] P:1789.40 E:0.110239 |  Fractionally from Jayden and Anthony.
[3214.00 - 3216.00] P:1843.49 E:0.120750 |  Well it was patient in the build-up play.
[3216.00 - 3220.00] P:1969.77 E:0.109681 |  There goes the hard time whistle but patience nearly paid off.
[3220.00 - 3222.00] P:1912.69 E:0.108445 |  Close header for Burnley.
[3222.00 - 3224.00] P:1932.96 E:0.102955 |  It goes behind it means that hard time.
[3224.00 - 3226.00] P:1810.86 E:0.113658 |  It is Burnley Nilsson and Nil.
[3226.00 - 3230.00] P:1818.87 E:0.114646 |  Yeah really good play from Hannibal there swinging the ball and he's left foot and Jayden Nantini.
[3230.00 - 3233.00] P:1835.91 E:0.094871 |  He just goes to try and head it and he just puts it past the post.
[3233.00 - 3235.00] P:1779.61 E:0.094773 |  But good play from Burnley.
[3235.00 - 3237.00] P:1801.32 E:0.095895 |  Not risking the ball.
[3237.00 - 3238.00] P:1767.47 E:0.132011 |  Just keeping the symbol.
[3238.00 - 3240.00] P:1786.44 E:0.107176 |  Waiting for that opportunity to open up there.
[3240.00 - 3243.00] P:1814.94 E:0.105201 |  And it did with Hannibal on this right hand side.
[3243.00 - 3247.00] P:1739.92 E:0.098966 |  Left foot cross and Jayden and Anthony expected himself to do a little bit better than he did.
[3247.00 - 3249.00] P:1567.87 E:0.103712 |  But I think it's been a good half for Nil now.
[3249.00 - 3255.00] P:1691.41 E:0.106742 |  I think both teams have had moments and it's been good energy to the game.
[3255.00 - 3258.00] P:1797.53 E:0.095511 |  Sunderland certainly had the early chances.
[3258.00 - 3262.00] P:1809.30 E:0.092408 |  Mayenda close range, half volley from him.
[3262.00 - 3266.00] P:1819.09 E:0.101965 |  Talbi chips it over to Brabka but wider the right hand post.
[3266.00 - 3269.00] P:1707.39 E:0.099276 |  As for Burnley, Lyle Foster had the ball in the back of the net.
[3269.00 - 3272.00] P:1706.70 E:0.098456 |  But that was rolled out for a foul in the build-up and then that header from Jayden Nantini.
[3272.00 - 3273.00] P:1672.41 E:0.115133 |  So it is Nil Nil.
[3273.00 - 3276.00] P:1689.50 E:0.091123 |  Who maybe has edged it? Charlie, having for you.
[3276.00 - 3281.00] P:1765.51 E:0.101833 |  I think the big moments Sunderland could have, I should have had them.
[3281.00 - 3284.00] P:1696.24 E:0.100411 |  Obviously Burnley have had that goal with the disallowed goal.
[3284.00 - 3287.00] P:1686.29 E:0.098146 |  But I think Sunderland had the big chances, haven't they?
[3287.00 - 3291.00] P:1693.03 E:0.104609 |  When Talbi goes through and he puts it past the post.
[3291.00 - 3294.00] P:1780.93 E:0.095348 |  And also the header knocked down as well.
[3294.00 - 3296.00] P:1854.56 E:0.091408 |  It was a good save from the Brabka.
[3296.00 - 3299.00] P:1811.12 E:0.102419 |  I would say that Sunderland has just edged it on the chances.
[3299.00 - 3301.00] P:1676.51 E:0.120421 |  But Burnley have had really good moments with the ball.
[3301.00 - 3304.00] P:1857.77 E:0.101642 |  I think they could play forward a little bit quicker and more.
[3304.00 - 3308.00] P:1795.14 E:0.099153 |  But again, it's been a good game, good entertaining game for Nil Nil.
[3308.00 - 3313.00] P:1816.56 E:0.095290 |  We'll see if the entertainment in terms of Burnley and Sunderland
[3313.00 - 3317.00] P:1851.69 E:0.112796 |  providing us with a little bit of action can extend to goals in the second half.
[3317.00 - 3319.00] P:1811.76 E:0.106318 |  Burnley Nil, Sunderland Nil at the break.
[3319.00 - 3322.00] P:1777.69 E:0.096389 |  Let's rejoin Mark Chapman in the 5 lives 40.
[3322.00 - 3326.00] P:1755.64 E:0.093934 |  We are now inside the last 50 seconds of this first half.
[3326.00 - 3328.00] P:1792.23 E:0.099171 |  Here is Buendia, no flag.
[3328.00 - 3332.00] P:1789.19 E:0.089635 |  Buendia scoops it, headed on by Torres.
[3332.00 - 3334.00] P:1717.01 E:0.081228 |  Rodgers is there, Vandenberg.
[3334.00 - 3336.00] P:1857.79 E:0.096807 |  Torres goes in and catches Henderson.
[3336.00 - 3338.00] P:1798.04 E:0.097958 |  That looks a painful one.
[3338.00 - 3340.00] P:1866.71 E:0.102798 |  He was on the stretch, pow Torres.
[3340.00 - 3345.00] P:1786.85 E:0.088206 |  And he absolutely clattered into Henderson, who's not moved since going to Grout.
[3345.00 - 3351.00] P:1720.37 E:0.082722 |  Brafe from Henderson and needed it because Brentford had just stopped momentarily.
[3351.00 - 3353.00] P:2043.28 E:0.101561 |  They thought there was an offside flag coming.
[3353.00 - 3355.00] P:1721.82 E:0.040617 |  There wasn't.
[3355.00 - 3360.00] P:1851.35 E:0.078454 |  There should have been really because Matt Cash was offside, gets involved in the play.
[3360.00 - 3363.00] P:1899.43 E:0.088704 |  He actually touches the ball, so he definitely does get involved.
[3363.00 - 3365.00] P:1877.25 E:0.067793 |  I don't know why it wasn't flagged.
[3365.00 - 3369.00] P:1719.75 E:0.062154 |  But from that point, just needed to put the bodies on the line
[3369.00 - 3371.00] P:1858.62 E:0.067496 |  for the umpteenth time in this first half.
[3371.00 - 3374.00] P:1784.00 E:0.062836 |  It's been such an attritional half.
[3374.00 - 3380.00] P:1830.89 E:0.087584 |  I'm offering a personalised goal service for you with updates of Hartley-Pool, two working goals.
[3380.00 - 3382.00] P:1589.29 E:0.095277 |  They've got a second goal.
[3382.00 - 3385.00] P:1866.99 E:0.093019 |  I'm now doing the halftime reports, which really should be Mark Chapman's job.
[3385.00 - 3387.00] P:1799.84 E:0.095564 |  But we'll go to Burnley and Julia Bolt.
[3387.00 - 3390.00] P:1826.24 E:0.110417 |  It's finished, Burnley, no, no.
[3390.00 - 3393.00] P:1901.85 E:0.109797 |  Lyle Foster looked to have got Burnley's first Premier League goal.
[3393.00 - 3397.00] P:1819.93 E:0.093404 |  It was wiped out by VAR though, a foul on Jensensealt in the build-up.
[3397.00 - 3400.00] P:1469.56 E:0.088399 |  So goalless at break, Burnley, no, no.
[3400.00 - 3403.00] P:1895.79 E:0.066734 |  Rest assured you won't catch me presenting that to the day.
[3403.00 - 3406.00] P:1526.96 E:0.064347 |  OK, well, it's war for ducks.
[3406.00 - 3413.00] P:1921.71 E:0.084337 |  Chapman's back in the seat again, and just a slightly bigger spotlight last week, wasn't it?
[3413.00 - 3415.00] P:1842.99 E:0.100766 |  Was it? I didn't notice, no.
[3415.00 - 3418.00] P:1860.12 E:0.107665 |  Henderson is back on his feet and he's getting the applause
[3418.00 - 3421.00] P:1936.43 E:0.094338 |  as he's forced to go over on that far side.
[3421.00 - 3424.00] P:1797.37 E:0.077416 |  The seven minutes have added on time are up,
[3424.00 - 3427.00] P:1841.70 E:0.091347 |  so this is just going to be those extra 30 odd seconds,
[3427.00 - 3430.00] P:1806.94 E:0.093257 |  which Kelliher will clear away downfield.
[3430.00 - 3435.00] P:1870.89 E:0.076551 |  The second goal separates the two sides, and it is Watarra on his debut
[3435.00 - 3439.00] P:1842.57 E:0.086809 |  for Brentford with the only goal of the game after 13 minutes
[3439.00 - 3441.00] P:1849.79 E:0.079940 |  that gives them the advantage.
[3441.00 - 3443.00] P:1816.96 E:0.102527 |  They have had another goal since disallowed,
[3443.00 - 3446.00] P:1825.99 E:0.094067 |  a shard of rises in the air, looks for the flick on towards Tiago,
[3446.00 - 3450.00] P:1924.37 E:0.097221 |  cleared away by Tyrone Mings, and there is the halftime whistle.
[3450.00 - 3452.00] P:1808.85 E:0.093312 |  Your quick thoughts, Rob Green.
[3452.00 - 3455.00] P:1737.32 E:0.102297 |  Yeah, brilliant from Brentford. They're with the manager.
[3455.00 - 3459.00] P:1931.20 E:0.097119 |  The work rate was there, they've made it there again, they've made it a scrap.
[3459.00 - 3462.00] P:1984.40 E:0.092670 |  They've done it early, that's where they got the goal from.
[3462.00 - 3464.00] P:1972.20 E:0.088050 |  They'll continue to do that.
[3464.00 - 3467.00] P:1947.21 E:0.086394 |  There's a lot of energy being put out there, not a lot of quality.
[3467.00 - 3472.00] P:1903.43 E:0.096304 |  But halftime here at the GTEC Community Stadium, Brentford won, Aston Villa 0.
[3472.00 - 3475.00] P:1826.82 E:0.124162 |  So elsewhere, Burnley 0, Sunderland 0, Bournemouth 1, Wolves 0,
[3475.00 - 3480.00] P:2011.82 E:0.107012 |  earlier final score from the Etihad, Manchester City 0, Tottenham 2,
[3480.00 - 3484.00] P:1935.83 E:0.082706 |  earlier in the championship, Charlton 0, Leicester 1,
[3484.00 - 3488.00] P:1707.13 E:0.091297 |  Colnill, Blackburn 3, Swansea 1, Watford 1.
[3488.00 - 3492.00] P:1791.61 E:0.098670 |  Let's start our three o'clock halftime reports at Carrow Road,
[3492.00 - 3496.00] P:1763.79 E:0.113866 |  where Middlesbrough's 100% record looks like it will continue. Chris Coles.
[3496.00 - 3500.00] P:1897.45 E:0.113975 |  Courtesy mark of a blistering two minutes, right at the end of the half.
[3500.00 - 3502.00] P:1782.29 E:0.110260 |  They lead Norwich by two goals to Nillen.
[3502.00 - 3506.00] P:1874.01 E:0.101230 |  Half Norwich dominated, missing numerous chances, but then bang, bang.
[3506.00 - 3509.00] P:1820.47 E:0.102006 |  Firstly, Finnazaz, powerful shot in at the front post,
[3509.00 - 3513.00] P:1782.59 E:0.099208 |  followed by a Tommy Conway tap in, with the Norwich defence nowhere to be seen.
[3513.00 - 3515.00] P:1707.16 E:0.107827 |  Norwich, Nill, Middlesbrough 2.
[3515.00 - 3518.00] P:1837.95 E:0.113656 |  Bungie, performance of the afternoon so far in the championship
[3518.00 - 3520.00] P:1901.17 E:0.109107 |  comes from Coventry, Nathan.
[3520.00 - 3522.00] P:1857.42 E:0.088074 |  Yes, no place like home for Coventry.
[3522.00 - 3525.00] P:1976.59 E:0.103663 |  Five-nil, they lead QPR on the day.
[3525.00 - 3528.00] P:1986.50 E:0.082999 |  Coventre announced they've bought the CBS Arena for themselves.
[3528.00 - 3531.00] P:1883.65 E:0.090804 |  It has been bouncing mark, two from Hadgy Wright,
[3531.00 - 3535.00] P:1943.08 E:0.085910 |  two from Jack Rodoni, and a goal and two assists for Brandon Thomas Asante.
[3535.00 - 3539.00] P:1845.58 E:0.087221 |  The worrying thing for QPR, mind, they're still 45 minutes to play.
[3539.00 - 3542.00] P:1887.71 E:0.088358 |  Halftime, Coventry five, QPR Nill.
[3542.00 - 3544.00] P:1813.36 E:0.119601 |  Next to St Mary, Sahel Sahi.
[3544.00 - 3547.00] P:1807.36 E:0.099968 |  Halftime, Southampton, Nill, Stoke, Nill, a closely fought 45 minutes,
[3547.00 - 3551.00] P:1751.69 E:0.091922 |  neither side stamping their authority on the other stoke
[3551.00 - 3556.00] P:1740.24 E:0.085512 |  with more control, while Southampton, twice through 18-year-old J Robinson,
[3556.00 - 3559.00] P:1655.34 E:0.089322 |  they've hit the post. Halftime here, Southampton, Nill, Stoke, Nill.
[3559.00 - 3563.00] P:1729.43 E:0.112430 |  Westburn, Brom's 100% record is continuing as they stand.
[3563.00 - 3564.00] P:1757.07 E:0.125027 |  John Bennett.
[3564.00 - 3567.00] P:1865.20 E:0.110113 |  Yes, thanks to Mikey Johnston, Westburn, Ajaubian, One Portsmouth,
[3567.00 - 3570.00] P:1763.53 E:0.108508 |  Nill, a cracking goal after being recalled to the starting 11,
[3570.00 - 3573.00] P:1915.02 E:0.095935 |  carried the ball to the edge of the box, fired a shot across the goalkeeper
[3573.00 - 3577.00] P:1774.47 E:0.106055 |  who didn't move. Florian Bianchini had one big chance for Portsmouth,
[3577.00 - 3581.00] P:1727.03 E:0.099712 |  but Westburn on the better side on course for three wins out of three.
[3581.00 - 3582.00] P:1712.49 E:0.109807 |  Westburn won Portsmouth, Nill.
[3582.00 - 3585.00] P:1801.69 E:0.116778 |  One nil at the Hawthorns, one nil at St Andrews, Pat Murphy.
[3585.00 - 3589.00] P:1803.92 E:0.086247 |  Peg, Fimers before halftime, Seiferd again 15 yards.
[3589.00 - 3592.00] P:1994.27 E:0.108808 |  Should have been more, Fuhirashi missed two scissors.
[3592.00 - 3595.00] P:1648.02 E:0.101896 |  Brandigan at the other end for Stubborn, but Oxford nearly pulled one back.
[3595.00 - 3598.00] P:1715.30 E:0.079268 |  Birmingham, one Oxford, Nill.
[3598.00 - 3603.00] P:1946.76 E:0.110472 |  We lumped the Sheffield teams together in our pre-match previews
[3603.00 - 3605.00] P:2013.40 E:0.113517 |  because they both had difficult starts to the season.
[3605.00 - 3608.00] P:2026.20 E:0.107652 |  It continues. Sheffield's united behind at the break.
[3608.00 - 3609.00] P:1780.01 E:0.093511 |  Naz Premji.
[3609.00 - 3613.00] P:1989.76 E:0.087663 |  Yes, Sheffield united, Nill, Millwall won the visitors deservedly ahead.
[3613.00 - 3617.00] P:1924.98 E:0.084672 |  Luke Cundle in the box, fired past Michael Cooper after a great flick
[3617.00 - 3618.00] P:1861.81 E:0.092367 |  from Mihailo Ivanovich.
[3618.00 - 3621.00] P:2107.39 E:0.093173 |  Cundle also saw a long-range effort tipped over.
[3621.00 - 3626.00] P:2057.02 E:0.080198 |  Josh Coburn right on halftime, a little mazy run and a shot which was turned behind.
[3626.00 - 3629.00] P:2032.51 E:0.082607 |  Sheffield united, boot off deservedly so.
[3629.00 - 3632.00] P:2095.11 E:0.082608 |  They've been atrocious. Sheffield united, Nill, Millwall won.
[3632.00 - 3637.00] P:1929.95 E:0.100891 |  Also not a good first half for Wednesday either, Stephen Wyeth.
[3637.00 - 3641.00] P:1985.08 E:0.086055 |  Now a first half to sum up where these clubs are currently at Mark Sheffield Wednesday.
[3641.00 - 3644.00] P:2040.26 E:0.101061 |  Scarcely put a functioning 11 on the field.
[3644.00 - 3648.00] P:2075.48 E:0.091955 |  Wrexham can add a striker of Keifer Moore's quality to their team.
[3648.00 - 3652.00] P:2081.81 E:0.091546 |  His first two goals for the club, both poachers finishes the difference between the teams.
[3652.00 - 3654.00] P:2032.20 E:0.103708 |  He even came close to scoring a hat trick.
[3654.00 - 3659.00] P:1974.31 E:0.093929 |  In between his goals, Charlie McNeil came close for Wednesday during their best spell in the game.
[3659.00 - 3665.00] P:1913.45 E:0.085690 |  But as things stand, it looks like Wrexham's first win at this level for 43 years.
[3665.00 - 3666.00] P:2116.44 E:0.092876 |  They lead 2-0.

[3672.00 - 3673.00] P:2013.90 E:0.105084 |  That's his third of the season.
[3673.00 - 3676.00] P:2002.25 E:0.084257 |  Preston won Ipswich-0 earlier in League One.
[3676.00 - 3680.00] P:1871.24 E:0.102163 |  Luton-Nill Cardiff won, Rotherham 2-2.
[3680.00 - 3685.00] P:1998.00 E:0.098745 |  We're with the leader, Stephen is this afternoon at Huddersfield, Andy Sixsmith.
[3685.00 - 3687.00] P:1851.22 E:0.066504 |  Huddersfield-0, Stephen-Nill tight game.
[3687.00 - 3692.00] P:1876.24 E:0.102344 |  Chappers' best chance is falling to the Terriers with Alfie May denied twice by Philip Marshall,
[3692.00 - 3695.00] P:1922.94 E:0.094674 |  who's also been penalised for holding onto the ball for longer than eight seconds.
[3695.00 - 3699.00] P:1770.32 E:0.090637 |  But you know not much has happened when having seen Mass Gopteria the Terrier once at the break.
[3699.00 - 3701.00] P:1837.77 E:0.079683 |  Huddersfield-0, Stephen-Nill.
[3701.00 - 3704.00] P:1721.67 E:0.120121 |  Elsewhere in League One, AFC Wimbledon lead third place.

[3739.00 - 3743.00] P:2006.47 E:0.099683 |  Stockport are behind at the break to Burton and it's worse for them as well
[3743.00 - 3746.00] P:1635.19 E:0.102070 |  because they've had Brad Hill sent off for a professional foul.
[3746.00 - 3749.00] P:2005.46 E:0.103372 |  Stockport-Nill, Burton-1 and Reading have turned things around at Wickham.
[3749.00 - 3753.00] P:1849.36 E:0.102856 |  They've gone from 1-0 down to 2-1 up at the break.
[3753.00 - 3758.00] P:1945.66 E:0.100030 |  Earlier in League 2, Newport-1, MK Don's 2, Walsall-1, Sol for Nill.
[3758.00 - 3760.00] P:1860.90 E:0.105078 |  How are the leaders, Crew, doing it?
[3760.00 - 3761.00] P:2057.87 E:0.118634 |  Jillingham, Mike Williams.
[3761.00 - 3764.00] P:1680.07 E:0.105304 |  They're not capitalising on their dominance in this first half mark.
[3764.00 - 3766.00] P:1743.94 E:0.100883 |  Captain Mickey Dmitry's header coming off the bar.
[3766.00 - 3769.00] P:1806.60 E:0.099335 |  Connor Thomas, his close range effort ruled out for offside.
[3769.00 - 3770.00] P:1787.94 E:0.102939 |  It is goalless at the break.
[3770.00 - 3772.00] P:2083.38 E:0.097987 |  Josh Andrews with Jillingham's only shot on target.
[3772.00 - 3775.00] P:1703.41 E:0.100519 |  Remember, Crew can make it five wins from five with a win here
[3775.00 - 3777.00] P:1704.37 E:0.086431 |  but they'll have to step it up in the second half.

[3778.00 - 3780.00] P:1891.89 E:0.127864 |  Grimsby are chasing them down at the top of the table.

[3866.00 - 3870.00] P:1636.01 E:0.114867 |  Yang's diving hitter superbly tipped onto the underside of the bar and out.
[3870.00 - 3874.00] P:1616.51 E:0.108564 |  Rodgers doesn't want to go to the bench with a trip to Kazakhstan to come,
[3874.00 - 3877.00] P:1597.11 E:0.113106 |  but he might need to because his sides are looking a little blunt.

[3951.00 - 3956.00] P:1866.57 E:0.070575 |  The pressure is on them and Scotland lead Wales 24-8.
[3956.00 - 3958.00] P:1963.60 E:0.104825 |  Let's switch our attention to the cricket.
[3958.00 - 3963.00] P:1745.41 E:0.121046 |  Earlier in the 100, Northern Supercharges women beat Oval in Vincibles and the

[3967.00 - 3973.00] P:2140.44 E:0.094243 |  Yeah, batting first. They've set the Invincibles 199 for victory, some fabulous hitting from

[4005.00 - 4011.00] P:1975.31 E:0.090825 |  Lauren Bell only conceding 18 from her 20 balls and Maddie Villiers taking three wickets.
[4011.00 - 4017.00] P:1972.90 E:0.092888 |  And in reply, they've just lost Danny Wyatt Hodge to a close LBW call that was overturned

[4020.00 - 4024.00] P:1918.14 E:0.084149 |  But the Braves currently are 15 for one after 10 balls and looking good to maintain their

[4035.00 - 4037.00] P:1326.96 E:0.094249 |  12 under par, one ahead of the clubhouse leader.

[4047.00 - 4049.00] P:1782.59 E:0.088583 |  He won last week in Denmark.
[4049.00 - 4055.00] P:1787.38 E:0.072991 |  He's equal the course record today with his 63 and at 10 under is just two behind five

[4122.00 - 4124.00] P:1678.84 E:0.109537 |  I'm actually excited.
[4124.00 - 4127.00] P:1844.42 E:0.139821 |  13 players have been on the adventure of a lifetime.
[4127.00 - 4128.00] P:1662.47 E:0.123333 |  Judging by how the game's gone.
[4128.00 - 4129.00] P:1990.56 E:0.125407 |  They should be.
[4129.00 - 4130.00] P:1264.92 E:0.138755 |  Pretty worried.
[4131.00 - 4134.00] P:1806.26 E:0.130148 |  But it all comes down to one final question.
[4134.00 - 4136.00] P:1552.54 E:0.143181 |  Where the X are we?
[4136.00 - 4140.00] P:1727.73 E:0.117113 |  My eyes are now open to how everyone is playing the game.
[4140.00 - 4141.00] P:1729.34 E:0.121918 |  Go get real.
[4141.00 - 4143.00] P:2047.19 E:0.122446 |  Destination X, the final.
[4143.00 - 4145.00] P:1842.49 E:0.134343 |  This Thursday on BBC iPlayer.
[4145.00 - 4146.00] P:1293.64 E:0.109773 |  This.
[4146.00 - 4152.00] P:1709.82 E:0.114070 |  Welcome back to Turf Moor where players are just coming out of the tunnel after half time.
[4152.00 - 4158.00] P:1658.52 E:0.108898 |  Burnley Nill, Sunderland Nill in a battle between two sides in the championship last season
[4158.00 - 4161.00] P:1638.35 E:0.107991 |  and two sides who had contrasting opening weekend.
[4161.00 - 4163.00] P:1534.29 E:0.109304 |  Sunderland's big win over West Ham.
[4163.00 - 4167.00] P:1582.84 E:0.093765 |  Burnley's big defeat against Tottenham.
[4167.00 - 4170.00] P:1476.23 E:0.101682 |  And here playing level.
[4170.00 - 4173.00] P:1704.07 E:0.108677 |  Two big chances, Sunderland in the first half.
[4173.00 - 4179.00] P:1784.03 E:0.118054 |  And one at the end of the first half of Burnley who've also had the ball in the back of the net,
[4179.00 - 4183.00] P:1851.53 E:0.100913 |  ruled out for a foul in the buildup by Lyle Foster on Jensen Seelt.
[4183.00 - 4185.00] P:1595.04 E:0.081300 |  So that has...
[4185.00 - 4188.00] P:1634.68 E:0.096477 |  Was ruled out and gave Burnley some brief hope.
[4188.00 - 4190.00] P:1736.66 E:0.117240 |  Took a bit of time for clarity but we got there in the end.
[4190.00 - 4194.00] P:1729.55 E:0.103158 |  The replay certainly showed that it was probably a right decision.
[4194.00 - 4199.00] P:1749.22 E:0.100446 |  So we still await the breakthrough in what feels like an important game for Burnley,
[4199.00 - 4201.00] P:1725.15 E:0.074522 |  knowing what's to come.
[4201.00 - 4203.00] P:1614.02 E:0.104682 |  Knowing the games on the horizon.
[4203.00 - 4206.00] P:1778.64 E:0.097063 |  Manchester United at Old Trafford next Saturday.
[4206.00 - 4211.00] P:1678.30 E:0.098013 |  And then Liverpool, Nottingham Forest and Manchester City all to come before.
[4211.00 - 4214.00] P:1560.64 E:0.086376 |  The end of September.
[4214.00 - 4217.00] P:1662.04 E:0.074122 |  That's a Sunderland. It's a favourable start.
[4217.00 - 4219.00] P:1635.02 E:0.090788 |  Beating West Ham on the opening day.
[4219.00 - 4221.00] P:1698.40 E:0.098603 |  Brentfield at home next week.
[4221.00 - 4225.00] P:1694.79 E:0.090124 |  And Palace, Villa and Forest all before the end of September as well.
[4225.00 - 4227.00] P:1727.47 E:0.111640 |  So a full start on the restart.
[4227.00 - 4228.00] P:1775.61 E:0.099284 |  We go again.
[4228.00 - 4231.00] P:1746.86 E:0.096870 |  Sunderland getters going through Granik's Jacker.
[4231.00 - 4232.00] P:1689.25 E:0.101303 |  Burnley the home side.
[4232.00 - 4236.00] P:1669.47 E:0.093188 |  As fans start to filter in from the concourses after the halftime refreshments.
[4236.00 - 4240.00] P:1837.83 E:0.097887 |  Burnley in their Claret shirts, white shorts and sky blue socks are from left to right.
[4240.00 - 4242.00] P:1651.12 E:0.077628 |  In the second 45 minutes.
[4242.00 - 4244.00] P:1798.60 E:0.101880 |  Sunderland all in black.
[4244.00 - 4246.00] P:1708.49 E:0.073432 |  From...
[4246.00 - 4248.00] P:1824.55 E:0.102647 |  Sorry, Sunderland on the left to right.
[4248.00 - 4250.00] P:1703.74 E:0.065951 |  Burnley right to left.
[4250.00 - 4252.00] P:1837.72 E:0.111481 |  No changes by either side at the break.
[4252.00 - 4254.00] P:1746.97 E:0.083119 |  When you threw the two teams in full,
[4254.00 - 4256.00] P:1572.16 E:0.089646 |  that wouldn't get the chance to do so.
[4256.00 - 4258.00] P:1705.28 E:0.111593 |  Sunderland forced into an early change in the first half.
[4258.00 - 4261.00] P:1652.99 E:0.099573 |  And the star man Dan Ballard went off
[4261.00 - 4264.00] P:1646.03 E:0.089955 |  with what looks like some form of leg injury.
[4264.00 - 4266.00] P:1622.88 E:0.085509 |  Received a bit of treatment, came back on,
[4266.00 - 4268.00] P:1629.56 E:0.100012 |  quickly decided that he couldn't continue.
[4268.00 - 4272.00] P:1699.96 E:0.086582 |  And so Jensen Seelt replaced him.
[4272.00 - 4276.00] P:1574.41 E:0.084686 |  Burnley have a throw in, trying to get things going pretty quickly.
[4276.00 - 4278.00] P:1618.00 E:0.084847 |  Scott Parker gave the ball to Clare Walker,
[4278.00 - 4280.00] P:1758.23 E:0.097315 |  gout down the touch line a little bit.
[4280.00 - 4282.00] P:1656.38 E:0.088588 |  Didn't have the option.
[4282.00 - 4285.00] P:1820.06 E:0.108370 |  So Stahls that run now launches it down the right hand touch line.
[4285.00 - 4286.00] P:1723.60 E:0.105573 |  The far side for Burnley.
[4286.00 - 4289.00] P:1530.68 E:0.081272 |  Here's Uggachukwu.
[4289.00 - 4292.00] P:1671.10 E:0.094134 |  And back into centre circles.
[4292.00 - 4295.00] P:1665.46 E:0.100987 |  Burnley in Sunderland, pretty level in possession.
[4295.00 - 4298.00] P:1616.03 E:0.074449 |  As we saw in the halftime, statistics,
[4298.00 - 4300.00] P:1664.74 E:0.088304 |  a couple of shots each.
[4300.00 - 4304.00] P:1561.26 E:0.081890 |  Sunderland the only one to have an official shot on target.
[4304.00 - 4307.00] P:1546.40 E:0.096447 |  Form of Premier League midfielder Charlie Adam alongside me.
[4307.00 - 4309.00] P:1783.94 E:0.104921 |  Yeah, lovely ball there from Mesthev.
[4309.00 - 4311.00] P:1733.72 E:0.071357 |  Switch of play out to Larsen.
[4311.00 - 4314.00] P:1689.18 E:0.103591 |  Now Uggachukwu, 20 yards out, right footed curling ball goes
[4314.00 - 4318.00] P:1658.21 E:0.084266 |  right behind the three Burnley players in the penalty area.
[4318.00 - 4320.00] P:1606.44 E:0.089126 |  And Hartman picks it up.
[4320.00 - 4322.00] P:1821.83 E:0.116629 |  He gets it back into the 18-yard box, lovely flick as well.
[4322.00 - 4325.00] P:1877.42 E:0.119956 |  And there's a chance for Cullen, who nestles it
[4325.00 - 4327.00] P:1807.55 E:0.128414 |  into the bottom right hand corner.
[4327.00 - 4330.00] P:1834.00 E:0.115728 |  That didn't take long for Burnley.
[4330.00 - 4333.00] P:1891.05 E:0.124962 |  Cullen celebrates the birth of his new board
[4333.00 - 4337.00] P:1896.39 E:0.111019 |  by putting his thumb in his mouth.
[4337.00 - 4340.00] P:1845.90 E:0.127663 |  And runs over to the corner, congratulated by all his team-mates.
[4340.00 - 4343.00] P:1862.87 E:0.115970 |  Burnley's Premier League season off and running.
[4343.00 - 4347.00] P:1888.42 E:0.120985 |  It was quick and slick as he rolls it into the bottom right hand corner.
[4347.00 - 4351.00] P:1889.34 E:0.108870 |  And Josh Cullen, the captain, means it's Burnley won.
[4351.00 - 4353.00] P:1912.13 E:0.125597 |  Sunderland Nails.
[4353.00 - 4355.00] P:1888.93 E:0.109877 |  Yeah, Broughier, I said it in the first half,
[4355.00 - 4357.00] P:1716.92 E:0.117608 |  you need your captain to step up at times and he did that.
[4357.00 - 4360.00] P:1864.80 E:0.118853 |  It's a brilliant ball, switch of play from Mesthev.
[4360.00 - 4363.00] P:1872.91 E:0.118847 |  Uggachukwu makes a back cross, comes, goes behind.
[4363.00 - 4368.00] P:1793.90 E:0.119565 |  And then all of a sudden Hartman plays the ball into Jadon Anthony,
[4368.00 - 4370.00] P:1885.79 E:0.114849 |  who flicks it round the corner.
[4370.00 - 4373.00] P:1805.51 E:0.111591 |  Josh Cullen joins in and he just bends it in the bottom corner.
[4373.00 - 4375.00] P:1841.03 E:0.090831 |  What a brilliant finish.
[4375.00 - 4377.00] P:1762.35 E:0.121324 |  Not knowing for his goal scornability,
[4377.00 - 4380.00] P:1805.39 E:0.095295 |  but he showed great quality there, Josh Cullen.
[4380.00 - 4383.00] P:1847.60 E:0.120317 |  He created more chances than any player on matchday one
[4383.00 - 4385.00] P:1921.29 E:0.116437 |  of the Premier League, Josh Cullen, five of them.
[4385.00 - 4389.00] P:1839.24 E:0.107812 |  Now he scores one and it's a big goal for Burnley,
[4389.00 - 4393.00] P:1915.87 E:0.113662 |  who now with what's to come, how precious three points could be this afternoon.
[4393.00 - 4397.00] P:1820.67 E:0.099493 |  And Turf Moore, back in the Premier League, comes alive.
[4397.00 - 4400.00] P:1786.68 E:0.091954 |  But hold on, hold on.
[4400.00 - 4403.00] P:1811.91 E:0.106178 |  Not again, surely for Burnley.
[4403.00 - 4407.00] P:1788.95 E:0.108529 |  There is a delay here as VAR will check something in the build-up,
[4407.00 - 4409.00] P:1839.71 E:0.121099 |  possible offside.
[4409.00 - 4412.00] P:1828.75 E:0.110148 |  So Burnley, you had a goal ruled out at one end in the first half,
[4412.00 - 4415.00] P:1895.26 E:0.098806 |  at the other end, thought they'd scored.
[4415.00 - 4419.00] P:1912.85 E:0.108953 |  Have a look at this, Charlie, and it's going to be on the long ball from Mesthev.
[4419.00 - 4422.00] P:1757.31 E:0.091177 |  Yes, the switch of play from Mesthev, I don't think he's offside.
[4422.00 - 4425.00] P:1763.50 E:0.111803 |  I don't think Larsen's offside, just seeing it visually here.
[4425.00 - 4428.00] P:1636.79 E:0.111760 |  But, yeah, it's gone.
[4428.00 - 4429.00] P:1789.51 E:0.125982 |  It's a goal.
[4429.00 - 4433.00] P:1849.34 E:0.115761 |  Bryn Larsen on the right hand, touch line, was waiting for Esthev's long ball.
[4433.00 - 4435.00] P:1938.94 E:0.113718 |  He was onside and the goal stands.
[4435.00 - 4440.00] P:1731.98 E:0.104828 |  Yeah, it's a great play from Burnley, out to Hartman, into Anthony.
[4440.00 - 4443.00] P:1792.79 E:0.111405 |  He flicks around the corner, it's a lovely finish from Josh Cullen.
[4443.00 - 4449.00] P:1772.85 E:0.109138 |  So Burnley off and running, Sunderland behind for the first time in the Premier League this season,
[4449.00 - 4453.00] P:1835.82 E:0.113575 |  and looking for quick response as they flick the ball into the penalty area down the middle.
[4453.00 - 4457.00] P:1837.41 E:0.111364 |  De Broukert off his line quickly, gathers and gets the ball with both hands
[4457.00 - 4462.00] P:1683.90 E:0.098142 |  before then rolling it at his own feet, takes a touch, and Burnley start from the back.
[4462.00 - 4465.00] P:1809.12 E:0.106547 |  Yeah, just what this crowd needed, wasn't it? The stadium needed.
[4465.00 - 4470.00] P:1638.38 E:0.099693 |  He's now starting to liven up, but again, good early second half goal from Burnley.
[4470.00 - 4475.00] P:1770.09 E:0.097764 |  He left this crowd and now you're looking to see Burnley get control of the game
[4475.00 - 4479.00] P:1610.78 E:0.100661 |  and really trying to dominate, but you've got to be aware of the Sunderland attack,
[4479.00 - 4481.00] P:1650.18 E:0.112562 |  because they are dangerous.
[4481.00 - 4486.00] P:1757.09 E:0.112163 |  Collision of bodies involving, Foster involving, Jaden Anthony of Burnley,
[4486.00 - 4491.00] P:1740.36 E:0.119290 |  and then also Trey Hume of Sunderland, who was kind of scissored off the ball.
[4491.00 - 4496.00] P:1728.38 E:0.112432 |  Free kick to Sunderland, five yards or so inside Burnley's half on this near right-hand side,
[4496.00 - 4500.00] P:1649.01 E:0.113528 |  which Granite Jacket will take. Fast start for Burnley, who lead.
[4500.00 - 4506.00] P:1674.63 E:0.107047 |  Fast start for Coventry at the start of the second half, who are now six nil up on QPR in the championship.
[4506.00 - 4511.00] P:1616.33 E:0.110988 |  Plymouth have taken the lead against Blackpool by a goal to nil in League One.
[4511.00 - 4514.00] P:1988.84 E:0.107925 |  In League Two, Harrogate have levelled against Chesterfield,
[4514.00 - 4519.00] P:1708.76 E:0.108521 |  a Jackets ball drifts over towards the left-hand side of the penalty area, headed away by Burnley.
[4519.00 - 4523.00] P:1838.81 E:0.107839 |  The second ball will be gathered by Ray Nildo, closed down by Anthony,
[4523.00 - 4528.00] P:1792.73 E:0.110324 |  rolls over the touchline on his deflection, on his interception, and out for a Sunderland throw-in.
[4528.00 - 4533.00] P:1678.56 E:0.115941 |  Elsewhere in the Premier League, Totti Gomez has been set off the Wolves,
[4533.00 - 4539.00] P:1638.43 E:0.103478 |  who are already a goal down in their game against Bournemouth in League One.
[4539.00 - 4543.00] P:1741.26 E:0.118285 |  Peterborough, the bottom club behind against Bradford City, who started really well.
[4543.00 - 4548.00] P:1630.72 E:0.092950 |  Celtic have taken the lead against Livingston at Celtic Park,
[4548.00 - 4553.00] P:1732.99 E:0.107285 |  in the Scottish Premier League. Don Castellide at Port Vale, Portsmouth have levelled
[4553.00 - 4558.00] P:1781.50 E:0.103766 |  at the Hawthorns against West Brom. Long-range shot comes in from Traekeam, deflects,
[4558.00 - 4561.00] P:1674.27 E:0.108540 |  and it will go out for a Sunderland corner on the right-hand side.
[4561.00 - 4568.00] P:1583.82 E:0.101223 |  Yeah, it's good to switch a play in the stair best. Traekeam stepping in again, a stair going for his body on the line.
[4568.00 - 4571.00] P:1592.44 E:0.116199 |  Now a corner where Jack is going to go and take an in-swinger.
[4571.00 - 4574.00] P:1688.40 E:0.110162 |  Right in front of the Sunderland fans as well.
[4574.00 - 4578.00] P:1936.84 E:0.116403 |  Many of them with their red and white vertical striped home shirts on in that away end.
[4578.00 - 4584.00] P:1647.24 E:0.088065 |  The cricket grounds stand with Burnley Cricket Club behind it to our right-hand side.
[4584.00 - 4590.00] P:1820.16 E:0.100083 |  Two-thirds full with Sunderland fans. Ingoe, Jäcker's corner, in-swinging all the way to the back post.
[4590.00 - 4593.00] P:1942.64 E:0.109201 |  All the way past everybody and behind for a Burnley goal kick.
[4593.00 - 4598.00] P:1728.90 E:0.094173 |  Yeah, they didn't get the blocks right. Too many people went across the front
[4598.00 - 4602.00] P:1628.94 E:0.089102 |  and Granit Jäcker's over-hit it, but it's still dangerous.
[4602.00 - 4608.00] P:1649.86 E:0.107545 |  You have to be wary of set plays and it's really important that Burnley is switched on to that.
[4608.00 - 4615.00] P:1664.07 E:0.093784 |  You've got good height in the team today in terms of his steve with Eckdahl with Uga Tukwa, Foster, Anthony Leicester,
[4615.00 - 4620.00] P:1722.82 E:0.111018 |  Edda Brin Larsen's a good header of all Kyle Walker, so there's a good height about Burnley today
[4620.00 - 4625.00] P:1712.31 E:0.107889 |  and they're going to need that because there'll be a lot of set plays over the season in the Premier League
[4625.00 - 4627.00] P:1485.19 E:0.083580 |  and you have to deal with that.
[4627.00 - 4631.00] P:1605.27 E:0.101700 |  Ball bounces over towards his near side touch line. Sunderland's passed down.
[4631.00 - 4638.00] P:1740.27 E:0.117127 |  Their right is intercepted and now Hannibal swings it in on the outside of his boot from the left of the penalty area.
[4638.00 - 4642.00] P:1836.81 E:0.099830 |  He was looking for the back post. They'll get another go here. Hartman's low cross.
[4642.00 - 4648.00] P:1747.02 E:0.095580 |  He's deflected out of the penalty area and now it's brought down by Jaden Ansonik.
[4648.00 - 4651.00] P:1736.86 E:0.106751 |  They were looking for Brunne Larsen Hannibal at the back post initially.
[4651.00 - 4654.00] P:1873.06 E:0.107180 |  Cullen, the goal scorer, right footed, swings it in, headed away.
[4654.00 - 4659.00] P:1659.95 E:0.097107 |  Good play from Burnley. They had a good tempo to the pass and good movements.
[4659.00 - 4662.00] P:1768.72 E:0.082571 |  Anthony picking up little pockets now.
[4662.00 - 4664.00] P:1693.17 E:0.088898 |  Burnley looking flow.
[4664.00 - 4667.00] P:1794.78 E:0.120802 |  And though they've given it away, now Mayenda will try and get Sunderland over the halfway line.
[4667.00 - 4675.00] P:1748.24 E:0.100261 |  He was all on his own. He had no room. Burnley have won it back and Turf Moores feeding off how their players are performing.
[4675.00 - 4679.00] P:1808.34 E:0.110713 |  Here's Uga Tukwa right corner of the penalty area. Lays it out. Hannibal now on that far side.
[4679.00 - 4684.00] P:1867.07 E:0.095638 |  Takes a little trick. Lays it back. Cullen, half encouraged to shoot by the Turf Moore faithful.
[4684.00 - 4687.00] P:1832.93 E:0.107284 |  Choose his not to. It wasn't the right option. Uga Tukwa tries to bundle his way in.
[4687.00 - 4691.00] P:1867.07 E:0.114321 |  It's Brunne Larsen. Dicks under the ball over the bar. It goes.
[4691.00 - 4695.00] P:1899.39 E:0.109963 |  He clasps his hands around his mouth and he knows that's half a chance.
[4695.00 - 4698.00] P:1858.00 E:0.094562 |  Yeah, half a chance. Probably at least hit the target.
[4698.00 - 4702.00] P:1779.09 E:0.100671 |  But good combination to Uga Tukwa. Cullen, Larsen, Hannibal there.
[4702.00 - 4705.00] P:1765.30 E:0.098916 |  Brunne Larsen coming on left side. He's very comfortable with both feet.
[4705.00 - 4710.00] P:1590.25 E:0.095048 |  And, you know, he blasts over the bar. Be expected to at least hit the target.
[4710.00 - 4712.00] P:1737.54 E:0.086919 |  Referee looks like he's got a problem.
[4712.00 - 4717.00] P:1702.74 E:0.108520 |  Referee is just jogging over towards that far side.
[4717.00 - 4721.00] P:1421.30 E:0.121089 |  See what that is for. Is he going to have a word with the member of the coaching staff?
[4721.00 - 4724.00] P:1725.07 E:0.099931 |  Or has he got an issue with his radio?
[4724.00 - 4730.00] P:1591.09 E:0.101523 |  Oh, it's an issue with the floodlights that are, I think, the flashing on and off.
[4730.00 - 4734.00] P:1683.28 E:0.084795 |  Almost like we're in a disco.
[4734.00 - 4737.00] P:1696.12 E:0.114048 |  Is that what he's complaining about? Is that what he's trying to get sorted?
[4737.00 - 4742.00] P:1659.28 E:0.096196 |  Possibly, yeah. Hopefully, there may be a party if we finally get three points after this today.
[4742.00 - 4746.00] P:1752.55 E:0.111993 |  Well, it's, yeah, no need to venture out into the town. We'll just have it here.
[4746.00 - 4748.00] P:1714.44 E:0.093858 |  Yeah, we'll just have it here, yeah.
[4748.00 - 4751.00] P:1908.77 E:0.102585 |  But, yeah, these floodlights, even though it's overcast, even though there's plenty of light,
[4751.00 - 4756.00] P:1711.39 E:0.090616 |  those floodlights flashing on and off intermittently are going to be, I guess,
[4756.00 - 4760.00] P:1857.50 E:0.106359 |  distracting to the players. Although it's not having a massive impact on the amount of light on the pitch,
[4760.00 - 4761.00] P:1795.50 E:0.112880 |  you can see the effect.
[4761.00 - 4763.00] P:1730.78 E:0.109582 |  Yeah, absolutely. That'll be Barrio Neil, the groundsman here.
[4763.00 - 4766.00] P:1628.77 E:0.107146 |  I know him, and I'll be giving him a bit of a stick about that.
[4766.00 - 4770.00] P:1719.80 E:0.093643 |  But unfortunately, it's a bit electric. It looks like it's sorted now, is it?
[4770.00 - 4772.00] P:1743.45 E:0.094211 |  No, it's not. It's coming on and off.
[4772.00 - 4775.00] P:1681.78 E:0.088707 |  There we go. They look a bit more stable now.
[4775.00 - 4780.00] P:1801.62 E:0.102747 |  Referee just having a word with the two captains, Josh Cullen and Granite Jacker as well.
[4780.00 - 4783.00] P:1755.13 E:0.106502 |  I think maybe to possibly ask, are you happy to play on with this for now?
[4783.00 - 4786.00] P:1724.05 E:0.101170 |  We've had nine minutes gone to the second half. It's Burnley once under and now.
[4786.00 - 4789.00] P:1692.15 E:0.088169 |  Yeah, just trying to get a little bit of deliberation.
[4789.00 - 4791.00] P:1690.17 E:0.109193 |  But the referee just says, we're waiting, we're waiting.
[4791.00 - 4793.00] P:1660.14 E:0.094733 |  So, you know, can we switch them off?
[4793.00 - 4797.00] P:1631.68 E:0.104518 |  Is there enough still daylight there to go with them so far without them?
[4797.00 - 4799.00] P:1763.89 E:0.112327 |  Yeah, it looks like we've switched them off.
[4800.00 - 4802.00] P:1685.66 E:0.109589 |  Oh, and now they're back on again.
[4802.00 - 4804.00] P:1575.14 E:0.102181 |  They need to sort this out.
[4804.00 - 4807.00] P:1676.32 E:0.087562 |  It's a lengthy delay, stoppage in play.
[4807.00 - 4810.00] P:1768.97 E:0.103136 |  Gives me a chance to run through what's going on elsewhere, though.
[4810.00 - 4812.00] P:1871.91 E:0.113823 |  Tramley, the Crawley, that's in lead two.
[4812.00 - 4815.00] P:1775.99 E:0.105319 |  Norwich are down to 10 in the championship there at home to Middlesbrough
[4815.00 - 4818.00] P:1634.67 E:0.090670 |  and behind this afternoon.
[4818.00 - 4821.00] P:1625.91 E:0.095687 |  The floodlights are on. They are stable.
[4821.00 - 4823.00] P:1781.52 E:0.089993 |  For how long? We'll wait and see.
[4823.00 - 4825.00] P:1671.98 E:0.111808 |  We've had 10 minutes to the second half.
[4825.00 - 4827.00] P:1732.71 E:0.113665 |  We've had a stoppage of a couple of minutes.
[4827.00 - 4831.00] P:1761.78 E:0.104740 |  Burnley lead through Josh Cullen's goal, which is now getting played on the big screens,
[4831.00 - 4835.00] P:1732.27 E:0.105065 |  right footed, curling into the far right corner from the left of the penalty area.
[4835.00 - 4841.00] P:1660.98 E:0.089033 |  And that has given Burnley a good start in the second half here.
[4841.00 - 4844.00] P:1671.63 E:0.104805 |  They can hear the fans aren't happy with the delay.
[4844.00 - 4846.00] P:1715.62 E:0.121120 |  What would you be doing as a player, Charlie?
[4846.00 - 4847.00] P:1794.31 E:0.123146 |  Would you want to play on this?
[4847.00 - 4850.00] P:1832.74 E:0.101861 |  Yeah, get on with it. You're not looking at floodlights. Let's just play.
[4852.00 - 4859.00] P:1699.16 E:0.094003 |  So, for now, referee Michael Salisbury having another word with Granite Jacke.
[4859.00 - 4862.00] P:1618.48 E:0.102466 |  Burnley, as players, may be less concerned about the floodlights.
[4862.00 - 4864.00] P:1638.37 E:0.103058 |  They were getting a bit of momentum in this game.
[4864.00 - 4867.00] P:1584.20 E:0.113633 |  Yeah, they did, but I think the only thing that this is, you could see,
[4867.00 - 4872.00] P:1592.92 E:0.109693 |  the different lighting with when they go on and off onto the pitch.
[4872.00 - 4874.00] P:1739.73 E:0.109323 |  So, I think that's obviously why the referee is so worried.
[4874.00 - 4877.00] P:1634.02 E:0.116951 |  He needs to try and get it sorted. They want to get them off.
[4878.00 - 4882.00] P:1537.10 E:0.104783 |  Yeah, there's enough daylight to play on without the floodlights.
[4882.00 - 4887.00] P:1758.54 E:0.107857 |  What they're doing faintly on the pitch is casting shadows and dark patches
[4887.00 - 4889.00] P:1798.59 E:0.084920 |  across the full length of turf.
[4889.00 - 4896.00] P:1696.02 E:0.099469 |  More this iconic old Gran, four individual stands connected on a couple of corners on our left-hand side.
[4896.00 - 4900.00] P:1687.42 E:0.104313 |  The players have been allowed a couple of balls onto the pitch to keep themselves worn
[4900.00 - 4903.00] P:1642.51 E:0.104757 |  and passing in between themselves.
[4903.00 - 4906.00] P:1676.15 E:0.083290 |  Lights have been turned off.
[4906.00 - 4909.00] P:1707.02 E:0.114263 |  Granite Jacke has given a thumbs up. The balls are kicked away.
[4909.00 - 4913.00] P:1698.58 E:0.098451 |  So, it looks like we are going to play on natural daylight, which makes sense.
[4913.00 - 4917.00] P:1726.06 E:0.088724 |  Yeah, we can, but, you know, fortunately, that issue,
[4917.00 - 4921.00] P:1570.10 E:0.103441 |  hopefully when they do have to come on later, you know, they don't have that problem.
[4921.00 - 4926.00] P:1622.19 E:0.101363 |  The games delayed too much, but, yeah, just Burnley started to have a little bit of momentum, didn't they?
[4926.00 - 4931.00] P:1673.72 E:0.101923 |  You know, a couple of half chances and that, but good start to Burnley for the second half.
[4931.00 - 4937.00] P:1776.82 E:0.103349 |  Now, they might not need them today. It is overcast, but there's still some good light on the turf more pitch.
[4937.00 - 4943.00] P:1733.85 E:0.106838 |  They will need it for Tuesday night when the host Derby County here in the second round of the league caught Burnley.
[4943.00 - 4949.00] P:1721.19 E:0.085819 |  So, a few days for the groundsmen to work that one out and the electricians to get themselves into turf more.
[4949.00 - 4955.00] P:1473.14 E:0.096650 |  It's iconic ground with the rolling hills in the background, sat in the valley,
[4955.00 - 4960.00] P:1559.78 E:0.101049 |  with the light brickwork terrace housing over the Bob Lords stand.
[4960.00 - 4962.00] P:1808.27 E:0.103717 |  That's got an amazing view, haven't we?
[4962.00 - 4967.00] P:1616.01 E:0.078741 |  Yeah, the factory chimneys are there. Throwback to Burnley's industrial past.
[4967.00 - 4972.00] P:1655.65 E:0.109277 |  Oh, Lancashire Town. It's a brilliant spectacle, really, in terms of that.
[4972.00 - 4975.00] P:1779.10 E:0.090661 |  And hopefully, there's a good spectacle second half in this game,
[4975.00 - 4981.00] P:1675.72 E:0.103384 |  because Burnley have started really well second half and obviously got their goal and half a chance so far.
[4981.00 - 4985.00] P:1597.77 E:0.098943 |  But, yeah, they look like they're really getting momentum within this game now.
[4985.00 - 4996.00] P:1637.43 E:0.091196 |  So, play back on the way. Burnley, those Claret shirts, right to left, Sunderland, all in black from left to right.
[4996.00 - 4999.00] P:1680.61 E:0.113742 |  All back with their goalkeeper Robin Rousse. He's going to be under a bit of pressure.
[4999.00 - 5003.00] P:1722.35 E:0.095569 |  The ball was hastily kicked back to him by Seelton.
[5003.00 - 5006.00] P:1730.59 E:0.112373 |  He had to drag it across his penalty area under pressure from Jay Nantini.
[5006.00 - 5008.00] P:1696.58 E:0.095448 |  Burnley have won it back, right-hand side.
[5008.00 - 5012.00] P:1823.71 E:0.120534 |  Brun Larson goes chasing on the byline. Plays the back here, which comes up right now, though.
[5012.00 - 5016.00] P:1907.64 E:0.116844 |  Good play, good clever play from Brun Larson. It goes behind for a Burnley corner.
[5016.00 - 5018.00] P:1906.57 E:0.104762 |  Yeah, good slides from Hannibal Dundaside.
[5018.00 - 5023.00] P:1730.23 E:0.104221 |  Larson never gave up there and managed to turn that into a corner, just shaking his mate's hand there,
[5023.00 - 5028.00] P:1625.62 E:0.107248 |  getting a little bit of life into the crowd and now an opportunity for Hartman to put a ball in the first one.
[5028.00 - 5032.00] P:1624.82 E:0.108380 |  He put in the first half, went straight into the goalkeeper's hands.
[5032.00 - 5034.00] P:1743.78 E:0.122552 |  So, Burnley corner, far side there, right.
[5034.00 - 5037.00] P:1659.05 E:0.075519 |  Expect an in-swinging delivery.
[5037.00 - 5039.00] P:1592.75 E:0.108134 |  And the championship, one of your former clubs.
[5039.00 - 5043.00] P:1737.80 E:0.098621 |  Charlie's taken the lead. Stoke lead at Southampton by a goal to Nill.
[5043.00 - 5045.00] P:1729.81 E:0.107712 |  Real positive for Stoke at the moment under Mark Robbins.
[5045.00 - 5049.00] P:1549.92 E:0.104147 |  I think they've had a good summer and it's been a long time.
[5049.00 - 5052.00] P:1528.47 E:0.084403 |  I think they've been in that championship.
[5052.00 - 5056.00] P:1625.97 E:0.109718 |  A few years since they've been ready, but never been in the top half, which is incredible.
[5056.00 - 5059.00] P:1617.74 E:0.099765 |  Hopefully this could be the season for the Portals.
[5059.00 - 5062.00] P:1657.29 E:0.108416 |  Corner in from the far side. Someone's in the near post. Flicked on by Cullen.
[5062.00 - 5065.00] P:1679.93 E:0.107619 |  Second head was a Burnley one. Cullen then knocks it back out of the corner.
[5065.00 - 5070.00] P:1894.38 E:0.110630 |  And it goes behind. Nobody in Sunday knew where that was going.
[5070.00 - 5074.00] P:1862.70 E:0.101794 |  Hartman belted that one in and it goes behind for another Burnley corner.
[5074.00 - 5076.00] P:1758.11 E:0.083358 |  Yeah, good ball from Hartman.
[5076.00 - 5078.00] P:1544.68 E:0.118113 |  Flick on from Josh Cullen comes back out to Hartman.
[5078.00 - 5083.00] P:1557.59 E:0.110271 |  He goes and tried to put a second ball and the Flick knows he's got an opportunity now to put the ball back in the box.
[5083.00 - 5085.00] P:1814.71 E:0.110441 |  Sheffield wins. They've got one back at Wrexham in the championship.
[5085.00 - 5090.00] P:1726.83 E:0.104069 |  Two on down though there. Barnett had the lead against Cheltenham Town in League 2.
[5090.00 - 5093.00] P:1853.48 E:0.098694 |  You're up to date. Five lives sport from Turfmore and it goes in at the near post.
[5093.00 - 5096.00] P:1661.42 E:0.100163 |  Headed away this time. Hartman's delivery in swinging.
[5096.00 - 5098.00] P:1577.87 E:0.101645 |  It was headed away in Sunderland now.
[5098.00 - 5101.00] P:1769.99 E:0.102957 |  Trying to get themselves on the counter attack as it's lofted up by Talby.
[5101.00 - 5104.00] P:1838.54 E:0.095665 |  On the chase he's Siddiqui.
[5104.00 - 5109.00] P:1958.09 E:0.114619 |  Well marshaled by Kyle Walker. His legs may be aging but there's still pace there.
[5109.00 - 5111.00] P:1813.74 E:0.104693 |  It's a header back for De Brouwer.
[5111.00 - 5113.00] P:1729.82 E:0.105876 |  Yeah, absolutely. There's plenty of legs in Kyle Walker.
[5113.00 - 5116.00] P:1676.93 E:0.082880 |  You know, he's seen his enthusiasm.
[5116.00 - 5120.00] P:1503.52 E:0.101882 |  He could have been easily from to City or go somewhere else.
[5120.00 - 5123.00] P:1672.37 E:0.099067 |  He's coming in to similar to Granite Jacqui.
[5123.00 - 5130.00] P:1622.96 E:0.102825 |  A good experience. Played at the highest level but coming in for a good fight in the Premier League in England.
[5130.00 - 5135.00] P:1803.71 E:0.098466 |  He wants to be at a club that's looking to go and use his experience as well.
[5135.00 - 5138.00] P:1472.30 E:0.091965 |  So I think it's a great sign for Burnley.
[5138.00 - 5142.00] P:1669.53 E:0.105520 |  Mansfield Town 3-1 up on late in Orient in League 1.
[5142.00 - 5146.00] P:1689.37 E:0.093444 |  Burnley in possession. Maxime Estève, the French defender.
[5146.00 - 5149.00] P:1768.57 E:0.106121 |  Played every game in the championship last season for them.
[5149.00 - 5152.00] P:1675.58 E:0.089449 |  He was the only player to do so as well.
[5152.00 - 5157.00] P:1658.67 E:0.098020 |  It was a pass back that Roof has to see away out of his penalty area.
[5157.00 - 5158.00] P:1625.81 E:0.078173 |  He reacted quickly.
[5158.00 - 5162.00] P:1667.84 E:0.104469 |  It was a big piece of business wasn't it? Estève linked with a few clubs in the summer.
[5162.00 - 5165.00] P:1629.20 E:0.105806 |  Out the back of the championship, Egan Rayley had a brilliant partnership.
[5165.00 - 5171.00] P:1767.50 E:0.098348 |  And obviously CJ went to Marseille and Estève signed a new contract at Burnley
[5171.00 - 5175.00] P:1590.91 E:0.097641 |  which was big news for the football club because they probably thought they might have lost them
[5175.00 - 5177.00] P:1591.40 E:0.099281 |  to someone else in the Premier League.
[5177.00 - 5180.00] P:1492.27 E:0.106977 |  So it's good for him to get that experience in the Premier League
[5180.00 - 5183.00] P:1804.39 E:0.112222 |  and really establish yourself as a top player.
[5183.00 - 5185.00] P:1778.51 E:0.111014 |  Trae Keehn goes down in front of the Sunderland fans.
[5185.00 - 5187.00] P:1705.37 E:0.115898 |  Thought he was fouled from behind by Hartman.
[5187.00 - 5188.00] P:1859.25 E:0.101557 |  Nothing doing said.
[5188.00 - 5190.00] P:1754.51 E:0.106637 |  Referee Michael Solesbreit.
[5190.00 - 5192.00] P:1821.71 E:0.103958 |  And so Burnley threw Estève.
[5192.00 - 5193.00] P:1959.03 E:0.117441 |  Are able to get it away.
[5193.00 - 5196.00] P:1734.35 E:0.111703 |  He plays a long crossfield ball that goes behind Brun Larson.
[5196.00 - 5198.00] P:1820.71 E:0.091630 |  Couldn't adjust his feet quick enough.
[5198.00 - 5202.00] P:1642.21 E:0.103323 |  And Sunderland will have a throw midway inside the Burnley half on that far side.
[5202.00 - 5204.00] P:1812.85 E:0.105578 |  61 minutes play, Burnley won.
[5204.00 - 5206.00] P:1837.27 E:0.100615 |  Sunderland nil, Stoke now down to 10.
[5206.00 - 5208.00] P:1524.45 E:0.092510 |  Divin Mabama has been sent off.
[5208.00 - 5211.00] P:1679.39 E:0.106074 |  They do lead Sanam to no by a goal to nil.
[5211.00 - 5213.00] P:1898.80 E:0.107931 |  Jacker on the edge of the centre circle.
[5213.00 - 5217.00] P:1675.16 E:0.104588 |  Just nudges it back into his own half ever so slightly for Alderete.
[5217.00 - 5220.00] P:1678.34 E:0.093522 |  And now it's out onto the left hand touch line for Sunderland
[5220.00 - 5222.00] P:1710.45 E:0.083364 |  to have a look towards the penalty area.
[5222.00 - 5223.00] P:1818.41 E:0.089976 |  Jacker doesn't look forward though.
[5223.00 - 5225.00] P:1683.09 E:0.088277 |  He plays it 10 yards behind him.
[5225.00 - 5228.00] P:1650.87 E:0.099868 |  So back out towards that far side touch line.
[5228.00 - 5229.00] P:1806.68 E:0.088284 |  Jacker then lifts it up.
[5229.00 - 5231.00] P:1759.33 E:0.103138 |  There goes the run.
[5231.00 - 5233.00] P:1727.08 E:0.069870 |  Off to Dinger.
[5233.00 - 5235.00] P:1566.84 E:0.090214 |  Ball couldn't find him though.
[5235.00 - 5239.00] P:1583.59 E:0.097887 |  Played it out because there's an injury here to Lesley Ogachukou
[5239.00 - 5241.00] P:1629.63 E:0.098747 |  who sat down in the middle of his own half.
[5241.00 - 5245.00] P:1572.11 E:0.089502 |  Sunderland making treble, treble substitution here.
[5245.00 - 5251.00] P:1602.14 E:0.100422 |  After 62 minutes, so trying to get a bit of energy back into the team.
[5251.00 - 5256.00] P:1610.52 E:0.081714 |  Three players coming off here at Dinger, it's one of them.
[5256.00 - 5259.00] P:1897.93 E:0.105833 |  So Dinger goes off also.
[5259.00 - 5261.00] P:1812.28 E:0.096970 |  As does Talby.
[5261.00 - 5267.00] P:1614.17 E:0.081580 |  So there are changes to the back line here from the manager,
[5267.00 - 5274.00] P:1565.94 E:0.092732 |  Regis Labrice, whose side are a goal down against Burnley
[5274.00 - 5278.00] P:1482.84 E:0.096793 |  with 62 minutes on the clock.
[5278.00 - 5282.00] P:1688.48 E:0.114152 |  Talby has put a shift in certainly in the first half,
[5282.00 - 5286.00] P:1526.71 E:0.092061 |  had that chance as well that he narrowly missed
[5286.00 - 5288.00] P:1750.04 E:0.112456 |  and sent wide of the right hand post.
[5288.00 - 5293.00] P:1597.92 E:0.089685 |  Robert comes on, Enzo Lafay and also Wilson Isidore.
[5293.00 - 5298.00] P:1610.79 E:0.087947 |  So Regis Labrice has changed his entire attacking front line.
[5298.00 - 5302.00] P:1501.26 E:0.098420 |  Yeah, and not a bad three to bring on isn't it?
[5302.00 - 5306.00] P:1488.26 E:0.101386 |  The three of them, excellent last season.
[5306.00 - 5310.00] P:1593.42 E:0.100197 |  Patrick Roberts is a tricky player.
[5310.00 - 5313.00] P:1676.75 E:0.089708 |  Isidore's got an eye for a goal.
[5313.00 - 5316.00] P:1521.52 E:0.092618 |  There's a big threat at the top end of the pitch
[5316.00 - 5319.00] P:1566.26 E:0.101141 |  and Lafay was a big summer sign wasn't he?
[5319.00 - 5324.00] P:1536.73 E:0.094242 |  So again, it's a big opportunity now for that front three
[5324.00 - 5329.00] P:1566.99 E:0.084171 |  to make a difference to what the front three lads did at the start of the game.
[5329.00 - 5336.00] P:1842.86 E:0.104152 |  Enzo Lafay on Isidore got the final goal in that three-nil win over West Ham.
[5336.00 - 5339.00] P:1880.85 E:0.106977 |  Last week Lafay now off the bench against West Ham
[5339.00 - 5342.00] P:1819.28 E:0.108160 |  and off the bench here against Burnley to try and make an impact
[5342.00 - 5346.00] P:1833.33 E:0.102603 |  and I think he's a permanent move in the summer for just short of 20 million.
[5346.00 - 5350.00] P:1731.39 E:0.105837 |  The Lonespell last season from Roma, which has now been made permanent.
[5350.00 - 5354.00] P:1824.82 E:0.100726 |  Uggachukwu has managed to limp off to the far side touch line.
[5354.00 - 5356.00] P:1925.90 E:0.081924 |  Burnley aren't going to make the change just yet,
[5356.00 - 5359.00] P:1717.55 E:0.103080 |  but it's been interesting to see if he can continue from here.
[5359.00 - 5363.00] P:1670.24 E:0.096728 |  Yeah, it looks like if Uggachukwu can't stay on it,
[5363.00 - 5366.00] P:1686.58 E:0.095181 |  it'll be Joshua Rohn that's going to come on as well.
[5366.00 - 5371.00] P:1645.61 E:0.092680 |  So another good size on the pitch, good energy, good legs.
[5371.00 - 5376.00] P:1633.25 E:0.106108 |  It was amazing that it was only his first Premier League debut last week against Tottenham.
[5376.00 - 5378.00] P:1485.84 E:0.092321 |  So really a proud moment for him.
[5378.00 - 5382.00] P:1612.33 E:0.097826 |  I met him on holiday in Dubai in the summer
[5382.00 - 5384.00] P:1594.26 E:0.109201 |  and he was really excited about the season ahead
[5384.00 - 5387.00] P:1550.99 E:0.092194 |  and they've done a brilliant job last year
[5387.00 - 5390.00] P:1497.01 E:0.090457 |  and let's say it's a different animal coming to the Premier League
[5390.00 - 5392.00] P:1580.36 E:0.103977 |  and it's a great test for him as a player.
[5392.00 - 5396.00] P:1727.86 E:0.103413 |  So what can Sunderland do now is the question
[5396.00 - 5399.00] P:1682.12 E:0.099062 |  will fill you in in some of the latest scores in a moment,
[5399.00 - 5402.00] P:1610.34 E:0.095669 |  particularly as Coventry now have seven against QPR.
[5402.00 - 5407.00] P:1540.38 E:0.090648 |  Victor Torpe has made it 7-0 for Frank Lampardtside,
[5407.00 - 5411.00] P:1538.60 E:0.097767 |  who are celebrating having their arena back.
[5411.00 - 5414.00] P:1803.48 E:0.104540 |  The CVS arena is back in Coventry City's own hands
[5414.00 - 5416.00] P:1877.89 E:0.099208 |  after 20 years at the stadium.
[5416.00 - 5418.00] P:1675.22 E:0.095068 |  They've never owned it until now
[5418.00 - 5420.00] P:1634.99 E:0.112642 |  and there's been a load of issues around that.
[5420.00 - 5423.00] P:1710.16 E:0.097907 |  Lombaul by Burnley, who are right to left in this second half
[5423.00 - 5427.00] P:1669.34 E:0.099354 |  as we look at it from the back of the main stand here at Burnley,
[5427.00 - 5430.00] P:1730.81 E:0.112876 |  giving us that great vantage point over the hills
[5430.00 - 5433.00] P:1732.36 E:0.116518 |  and it's Harry's housing and Burnley is lost out here.
[5433.00 - 5435.00] P:1714.20 E:0.112833 |  Burnley trying to get the ball in the box,
[5435.00 - 5437.00] P:1745.46 E:0.086985 |  Bruno Larson from the right-hand side,
[5437.00 - 5439.00] P:1863.16 E:0.114615 |  it is blocked out inside the penalty area,
[5439.00 - 5442.00] P:1819.92 E:0.093155 |  he's trying to find Lyle Foster and he couldn't
[5442.00 - 5446.00] P:1652.46 E:0.111446 |  and Sunderland escaped from what was a lucky moment for Ray Nilda.
[5446.00 - 5448.00] P:1799.57 E:0.106399 |  Yeah, it was a lucky moment there
[5448.00 - 5452.00] P:1676.88 E:0.100054 |  but a good reaction from Jed Nantidair to go and win the ball back.
[5452.00 - 5455.00] P:1584.68 E:0.106123 |  An opportunity now for Burnley to really put the foot on the gas
[5455.00 - 5457.00] P:1425.37 E:0.088817 |  press Sunderland.
[5457.00 - 5459.00] P:1889.72 E:0.122437 |  Huddersfield Town lead, Stevenish by a goal to Nile,
[5459.00 - 5461.00] P:1761.65 E:0.097212 |  Anthony May's got that one in league,
[5461.00 - 5463.00] P:1758.61 E:0.112016 |  one also Wimbledon now, Tuneil upon Barns,
[5463.00 - 5467.00] P:1697.18 E:0.100982 |  the Akrington Stanley level at home against Grimsby Town
[5467.00 - 5469.00] P:1737.50 E:0.108235 |  to get you up to date on five sports extra.
[5469.00 - 5472.00] P:1769.59 E:0.106692 |  Well, it's Burnley won, Sunderland nearly in the Premier League
[5472.00 - 5474.00] P:1645.93 E:0.119381 |  and Sunderland through Wilson, is it all?
[5474.00 - 5477.00] P:1879.96 E:0.097837 |  Trying to get through on the right-hand side and can't,
[5477.00 - 5479.00] P:1799.02 E:0.107387 |  Burnley cleared away from their own,
[5479.00 - 5482.00] P:1824.60 E:0.100570 |  deep in that side, their own defensive third
[5482.00 - 5484.00] P:1741.60 E:0.120395 |  and Hannibal's giving it away
[5484.00 - 5487.00] P:1749.08 E:0.107794 |  and you can hear the frustration in and around Terv,
[5487.00 - 5490.00] P:1773.11 E:0.104799 |  more on that when they thought they might be on a promising counterattack.
[5490.00 - 5493.00] P:1716.32 E:0.096276 |  Granite Jacke for Sunderland to the right of the centre-circle
[5493.00 - 5499.00] P:1597.51 E:0.093354 |  just at walking pace, knocks it into the path of Patrick Roberts.
[5499.00 - 5502.00] P:1444.49 E:0.108129 |  11 years since his Premier League debut,
[5502.00 - 5506.00] P:1625.25 E:0.078848 |  which came full-follom against Manchester City.
[5506.00 - 5508.00] P:1761.26 E:0.110399 |  His first taste back in the Premier League,
[5508.00 - 5512.00] P:1577.81 E:0.077310 |  didn't play last weekend against West Ham United.
[5512.00 - 5515.00] P:1519.96 E:0.086556 |  Here's Sadeke for Sunderland,
[5515.00 - 5518.00] P:1666.13 E:0.099947 |  pushes it out towards the corner on the left-hand side,
[5518.00 - 5521.00] P:1532.31 E:0.102740 |  deep inside the Burnley half-lane, back to Ray Nildo.
[5521.00 - 5523.00] P:1702.22 E:0.109186 |  Ray Nildo did have a look into the penalty area,
[5523.00 - 5526.00] P:1791.23 E:0.101640 |  changed his mind against it, a couple of 1-2s going on out there.
[5526.00 - 5530.00] P:1580.65 E:0.102984 |  He sweeps it back towards the edge of the centre-circle for Omar Alderete.
[5530.00 - 5534.00] P:1628.24 E:0.093419 |  Yeah, a couple of subs look like it's coming from Burnley as well,
[5534.00 - 5538.00] P:1647.91 E:0.100421 |  the sawn and Jocelyn Laurent coming on back in.
[5538.00 - 5540.00] P:1646.38 E:0.090604 |  Sunderland got a chance.
[5540.00 - 5543.00] P:1810.43 E:0.116001 |  Edge of the penalty area, Jacke slides it just outside the box,
[5543.00 - 5547.00] P:1804.57 E:0.104673 |  it misses Jacke on the return pass through as sealed.
[5547.00 - 5550.00] P:1891.80 E:0.116312 |  Didn't know what to do with it, go for goal as a defender
[5550.00 - 5553.00] P:1819.34 E:0.112471 |  or try and find the route through and eventually he's blocked off.
[5553.00 - 5556.00] P:1804.56 E:0.098997 |  The challenge comes in Burnley, get it up to the halfway line,
[5556.00 - 5559.00] P:1800.72 E:0.110622 |  it'll come back at them, here come the Black Cats again,
[5559.00 - 5562.00] P:1742.59 E:0.093989 |  left-hand corner of the penalty area for Le Fay.
[5562.00 - 5565.00] P:1643.46 E:0.086581 |  Jacke, referee has to get out of his way
[5565.00 - 5569.00] P:1832.37 E:0.090615 |  and actually I think put Jacke off there in his decision-making process.
[5569.00 - 5572.00] P:1829.67 E:0.107070 |  And towards the left-hand side, plenty of Black Shirts in the box,
[5572.00 - 5576.00] P:1784.90 E:0.091585 |  he's lifted up into the penalty area and headed away by Hartman.
[5576.00 - 5578.00] P:1735.23 E:0.123235 |  Burnley with some defending to do as the ball runs over
[5578.00 - 5581.00] P:1747.79 E:0.106093 |  towards this near-side touchline, Sunderland thrown.
[5581.00 - 5585.00] P:1731.13 E:0.093959 |  Yeah, now's a good time for Burnley just to take a little bit of stinging out the game now.
[5585.00 - 5590.00] P:1759.27 E:0.100709 |  But yeah, it was a couple of injuries there, a bit of trick-walk coming off.
[5590.00 - 5594.00] P:1878.25 E:0.117310 |  Burnley have been able to soak up that pressure a little bit
[5594.00 - 5596.00] P:1845.06 E:0.123833 |  and at the moment it's going forward,
[5596.00 - 5599.00] P:1938.00 E:0.118982 |  it's important that they don't just stay off the game
[5599.00 - 5602.00] P:1918.79 E:0.110970 |  and allow something to try and come on to them
[5602.00 - 5604.00] P:1919.00 E:0.118235 |  and just start putting cross in the box.
[5604.00 - 5607.00] P:1872.91 E:0.109095 |  But there's a good header there from Hartman round the back
[5607.00 - 5612.00] P:1900.23 E:0.114286 |  and to be fair, Larsen and Uggertrucker have put a great shift in so far
[5612.00 - 5614.00] P:1815.59 E:0.110489 |  and have done brilliant for the team going back the pitch.
[5614.00 - 5616.00] P:1845.59 E:0.120836 |  It's important that these two guys come around now
[5616.00 - 5618.00] P:1836.02 E:0.100588 |  and do the same shift for the team.
[5618.00 - 5620.00] P:1843.36 E:0.106081 |  So Jacke and Burnley and Larsen
[5620.00 - 5625.00] P:1689.04 E:0.097191 |  and Leslie Uggertrucker who was obviously carrying that knock has departed.
[5626.00 - 5634.00] P:1540.01 E:0.084519 |  On comes Oliver Sond and Josh Lorrom as well.
[5634.00 - 5644.00] P:1504.29 E:0.083004 |  Sond who played last weekend in that backline against Spurs Lorrom
[5644.00 - 5647.00] P:1768.03 E:0.092684 |  and got his first taste of Premier League action last weekend.
[5647.00 - 5652.00] P:1731.97 E:0.108069 |  I mean, previously been at the likes of QPR, Wigan, Berry, Shrewsbury, Redding and Stokey.
[5652.00 - 5656.00] P:1592.62 E:0.084591 |  He's chanting the Premier League now for Burnley under Scott Parker
[5656.00 - 5662.00] P:1790.85 E:0.082293 |  who's got his suit open at the jacket, a narrow knotted tight
[5662.00 - 5664.00] P:1802.71 E:0.113985 |  to complete his look as well.
[5664.00 - 5667.00] P:1602.60 E:0.093259 |  Angie Labrises sat down in his dugout for now,
[5667.00 - 5670.00] P:1639.27 E:0.105003 |  Pensive and pondering his hand resting on his chin.
[5670.00 - 5673.00] P:1763.04 E:0.116356 |  20 minutes to go, Burnley leading Sondland by Gatling.
[5673.00 - 5677.00] P:1926.35 E:0.106547 |  Yeah, just unsacrifice and run from Lorrom there to chase.
[5677.00 - 5681.00] P:1757.60 E:0.091368 |  40 yards to close the goalkeeper down to then kick the ball at pitch
[5681.00 - 5683.00] P:1554.41 E:0.091211 |  and a little bit of rest biting the team.
[5683.00 - 5686.00] P:1738.09 E:0.106024 |  But again, Sond coming on there now to do the Larsen role,
[5686.00 - 5691.00] P:1571.84 E:0.092927 |  to track back with Reinaldo and do the defensive work
[5691.00 - 5696.00] P:1534.05 E:0.085715 |  because a lot of the best stuff for Sondland's come down there left hand side.
[5696.00 - 5701.00] P:1607.67 E:0.098180 |  Lorrom and Mejbri, Hannibal Mejbri combined on that far side touch line.
[5701.00 - 5706.00] P:1657.40 E:0.079358 |  Reinaldo helps clear it away, foul given.
[5706.00 - 5711.00] P:1505.49 E:0.100199 |  Sondland player is just pulled down on the touch line.
[5711.00 - 5715.00] P:1641.41 E:0.098780 |  Stottport County down to 10 but have levelled through Jack Diamond
[5715.00 - 5720.00] P:1440.61 E:0.099949 |  at home against Burton Albion this afternoon in League One.
[5720.00 - 5726.00] P:1458.34 E:0.075840 |  Sondland in possession then using Silt midway inside his own half.
[5726.00 - 5733.00] P:1654.25 E:0.097750 |  The black shirts, shorts and socks of Sondland behind as they are by a goal to nil.
[5733.00 - 5740.00] P:1532.05 E:0.090772 |  He's Diara, sealed to game, just across towards that far side now with Sondland.
[5740.00 - 5743.00] P:1633.10 E:0.093657 |  Try a little bit of patience in an attack.
[5743.00 - 5748.00] P:1540.83 E:0.098441 |  Certainly the first half that was about using the pace of my end and my end has gone off.
[5748.00 - 5751.00] P:1442.26 E:0.069330 |  Now they have to find a different approach.
[5751.00 - 5753.00] P:1756.99 E:0.069843 |  Burnley five at the back.
[5753.00 - 5757.00] P:1704.50 E:0.082983 |  They've solidified their defence holding on to this one nearly.
[5757.00 - 5759.00] P:1914.32 E:0.114516 |  The early cross comes in from the right hand side.
[5759.00 - 5762.00] P:1934.04 E:0.106736 |  Isidore was trying to race in there and get a touch.
[5762.00 - 5765.00] P:1800.21 E:0.091274 |  Colin Debrouc catches at chest height.
[5765.00 - 5773.00] P:1734.39 E:0.087612 |  Good run from Isidore across the front there but Igbal just gave him a little bit of a nudge to put him off his stride.
[5773.00 - 5781.00] P:1725.63 E:0.091564 |  Burnley trying to keep that energy and that enthusiasm to press and keep the crowd with them.
[5781.00 - 5784.00] P:1489.29 E:0.089949 |  Sondland looking to try and get back in the game again.
[5784.00 - 5786.00] P:1590.82 E:0.084005 |  Putting Cross in the box.
[5786.00 - 5790.00] P:1681.49 E:0.086025 |  Roberts, Lafer, Isidore, they are a big threat and they were last year
[5790.00 - 5798.00] P:1619.16 E:0.080923 |  and they look to be this year but again the game is on an ifedge in terms of where it's going to finish.
[5798.00 - 5800.00] P:1693.26 E:0.082884 |  I like what Burnley have done.
[5800.00 - 5804.00] P:1751.37 E:0.099482 |  They've really gone aggressive and trying to keep that energy within the team and the group.
[5804.00 - 5811.00] P:1781.46 E:0.093131 |  Now they've got control of the ball and looking to try and build around what they're doing.
[5811.00 - 5813.00] P:1520.78 E:0.109453 |  As it stands, we're burning leading 1-0.
[5813.00 - 5816.00] P:1732.54 E:0.106652 |  Three promoted sides will have three points.
[5816.00 - 5818.00] P:1830.38 E:0.110864 |  They're leading to come later though.
[5818.00 - 5819.00] P:1796.26 E:0.115736 |  They could get two in from two.
[5819.00 - 5828.00] P:1668.71 E:0.099048 |  They're Arsenal and that is available on BBC Radio 5 live from 530 John Murray and Andy Regia, commentary team at the Emirates.
[5828.00 - 5830.00] P:1828.67 E:0.112741 |  And then that's followed by 606.
[5830.00 - 5835.00] P:1674.95 E:0.096890 |  Natalie Pike and Chris Sutton 08, 085, 909, 693.
[5835.00 - 5836.00] P:1382.10 E:0.088243 |  The number you need.
[5836.00 - 5838.00] P:1723.28 E:0.098017 |  Free phone from mobiles and Lundland.
[5838.00 - 5844.00] P:1597.91 E:0.085874 |  She can text 85058 as well at your standard message rate.
[5844.00 - 5848.00] P:1680.19 E:0.100336 |  There's live 100 cricket to follow us here on.
[5848.00 - 5850.00] P:1887.70 E:0.080417 |  Five sports extra as well.
[5850.00 - 5853.00] P:1679.63 E:0.076281 |  Lundland spirit against the Southern Brave.
[5853.00 - 5858.00] P:1514.60 E:0.082695 |  Scotland and Wales available on sports extra at two.
[5858.00 - 5863.00] P:1671.21 E:0.107749 |  And then tomorrow, Steve Crossman from 12 o'clock on 5 Live Premier League Sunday.
[5863.00 - 5869.00] P:1737.68 E:0.101180 |  He's live from Everton's New Hill Dickinson Stadium there preparing to take on Brighton.
[5869.00 - 5873.00] P:1722.56 E:0.103289 |  And then from half past four it's followed against Manchester United.
[5873.00 - 5883.00] P:1804.46 E:0.104048 |  Live Premier League commentary than anybody else on BBC Radio 5 live and across five sports extra and on the BBC Sands at this season as well.
[5883.00 - 5885.00] P:1722.04 E:0.111420 |  There's two other streams for you.
[5885.00 - 5889.00] P:1682.86 E:0.110574 |  If you flip that dial at the top of your BBC Sands at, that's simple to do.
[5889.00 - 5897.00] P:1726.82 E:0.091849 |  You can find sports extra, sports extra two and sports extra three this season as well.
[5897.00 - 5902.00] P:1813.54 E:0.111414 |  Right now, Burnley wants Sunderland 012 live Premier League three o'clock kickoff for you this Saturday.
[5902.00 - 5908.00] P:1754.34 E:0.100577 |  Brentford at home against Aston Villa is your commentary over on BBC Radio 5 live.
[5908.00 - 5911.00] P:1717.33 E:0.103938 |  Brentford leading by a goal to nil.
[5911.00 - 5915.00] P:1645.99 E:0.089415 |  Celtic have gone two-nil up at home to Livingston in the Scottish Premier Sheet.
[5915.00 - 5918.00] P:1562.62 E:0.102077 |  Sunderland looking for the second goal in this game.
[5918.00 - 5921.00] P:1686.66 E:0.105490 |  Getting in control with the possession once again.
[5921.00 - 5924.00] P:1762.93 E:0.108337 |  Getting in control but finding it very hard to get through that Burnley team.
[5924.00 - 5928.00] P:1691.80 E:0.107642 |  Dropping in 5-4-1, Lyle Foster just basically sitting in front of Cullin and La Ronde.
[5928.00 - 5932.00] P:1719.45 E:0.097383 |  Hannibal's over on that right-hand side and Jadnanti is trying to protect the middle of pitch.
[5932.00 - 5937.00] P:1675.23 E:0.099337 |  Now Hartman's out to Roberts in the wide area but really good control.
[5937.00 - 5939.00] P:1841.82 E:0.108081 |  Defenses display from Burnley so far.
[5939.00 - 5944.00] P:1822.66 E:0.109863 |  No spaces to be able to play through and just frustrating Sunderland which is good.
[5944.00 - 5945.00] P:1712.40 E:0.112772 |  It's what you want to do.
[5945.00 - 5950.00] P:1847.27 E:0.100681 |  That's what they built their reputation on.
[5950.00 - 5953.00] P:1814.60 E:0.112109 |  Last season Burnley, all those clean sheets.
[5953.00 - 5957.00] P:1719.53 E:0.103524 |  They can keep one here against Sunderland.
[5957.00 - 5961.00] P:1703.99 E:0.120397 |  It will be really pleasing to Scott Park and they can add to that with three points as Metsbury
[5961.00 - 5962.00] P:1684.57 E:0.116565 |  pushing it through on the right-hand side.
[5962.00 - 5964.00] P:1902.59 E:0.115296 |  Josh La Ronde has got a real sprint to get there.
[5964.00 - 5968.00] P:1979.39 E:0.112207 |  The ball didn't have a lot of pace but La Ronde was coming from a long way back
[5968.00 - 5969.00] P:1995.79 E:0.117814 |  and he raced over to the far touch line.
[5969.00 - 5971.00] P:1925.73 E:0.104821 |  He couldn't keep it in play.
[5971.00 - 5972.00] P:1596.53 E:0.106278 |  Burnley are good to...
[5972.00 - 5976.00] P:1770.50 E:0.111848 |  They're happy just to sit in a low block and protect and not allow anything.
[5976.00 - 5980.00] P:1848.57 E:0.105544 |  Allows Jacke to get on the ball and centre-backs have the ball
[5980.00 - 5985.00] P:1798.23 E:0.106125 |  and wait for that moment when they can actually get a trigger to go and press the ball.
[5985.00 - 5988.00] P:1879.70 E:0.107901 |  Like they did there, Hannibal just actually over-hit the pass
[5988.00 - 5991.00] P:1780.87 E:0.098016 |  but now they're ready and they're in good shape
[5991.00 - 5993.00] P:1738.16 E:0.093372 |  and getting good distances between the back line and the middle line.
[5993.00 - 5998.00] P:1664.07 E:0.098468 |  The team's compact which really helps Burnley to get up to the ball.
[5999.00 - 6001.00] P:1674.27 E:0.124906 |  Down the line it goes inside the right channel
[6001.00 - 6004.00] P:1726.70 E:0.101229 |  but straight on through for Robin Roost.
[6004.00 - 6005.00] P:1652.35 E:0.095124 |  Stopport County down to 10 now.
[6005.00 - 6006.00] P:1629.28 E:0.118551 |  Lee Burton, how he and Byte.
[6006.00 - 6009.00] P:1737.95 E:0.097153 |  Two goals to Anna Edgeley Park.
[6009.00 - 6012.00] P:1647.09 E:0.084164 |  Jacke Hume, just let the ball come to him
[6012.00 - 6015.00] P:1807.30 E:0.109294 |  and sliding in with Esteve and he's missed his interception
[6015.00 - 6019.00] P:1873.87 E:0.114828 |  but Hume can't do anything with it trying to play it up to the edge of the Burnley D
[6019.00 - 6023.00] P:1749.50 E:0.103957 |  and themselves the Claret's taking a little bit of time in getting rid of the ball.
[6023.00 - 6024.00] P:2043.27 E:0.115661 |  Eventually they do.
[6024.00 - 6025.00] P:1855.44 E:0.106731 |  In fact it's up towards the halfway line
[6025.00 - 6028.00] P:1806.04 E:0.108439 |  and Lyall Foster will get it under control and hold it up
[6028.00 - 6030.00] P:1822.49 E:0.115539 |  and wait for a little bit of support.
[6030.00 - 6032.00] P:1692.79 E:0.095149 |  Dancers in and around.
[6032.00 - 6034.00] P:1677.18 E:0.092501 |  No, Siddiqui.
[6034.00 - 6037.00] P:1544.72 E:0.097291 |  Eventually Burnley do give away the ball.
[6038.00 - 6041.00] P:1670.55 E:0.106155 |  But Sunderland had half a chance there
[6041.00 - 6045.00] P:1678.86 E:0.103442 |  particularly with Esteve out of position and they couldn't capitalise on it.
[6045.00 - 6048.00] P:1590.84 E:0.111118 |  Yeah, there's a futile legs out there in both teams at the moment.
[6048.00 - 6050.00] P:1609.48 E:0.102450 |  You could see that with the turnover that is
[6050.00 - 6055.00] P:1586.27 E:0.084174 |  and giving the ball away but you know, good compact looking, good distances there.
[6055.00 - 6057.00] P:1726.95 E:0.114025 |  Patrick Roberts into the right corner of the penalty area.
[6057.00 - 6060.00] P:1704.77 E:0.097611 |  He's clipped up by Diara.
[6060.00 - 6061.00] P:1680.99 E:0.126160 |  Where's the ball dropping?
[6061.00 - 6063.00] P:1918.71 E:0.116263 |  Is it all going to make himself in use?
[6063.00 - 6066.00] P:1940.47 E:0.116695 |  Well shielded by Kyle Walker and that allowed the broker inside
[6066.00 - 6070.00] P:1898.34 E:0.104937 |  his six-yard box to dive down to his right-hand side and make the save.
[6070.00 - 6072.00] P:1634.03 E:0.076044 |  No, it was a good block from Kyle Walker there
[6072.00 - 6074.00] P:1581.02 E:0.096452 |  but a few tire legs are important.
[6074.00 - 6076.00] P:1574.61 E:0.090834 |  They don't keep turning the ball over.
[6076.00 - 6078.00] P:1547.54 E:0.109737 |  That's what Burnley have done a lot today.
[6078.00 - 6080.00] P:1645.88 E:0.118729 |  They've turned the ball over and it's become harder and harder.
[6080.00 - 6083.00] P:1783.46 E:0.114045 |  See Lyall Foster, they look tired, they look energetic.
[6083.00 - 6086.00] P:1650.24 E:0.098734 |  I think Lyall Foster could be a big player for Burnley this year.
[6086.00 - 6088.00] P:1763.71 E:0.098867 |  Obviously the last time they were in the Premier League
[6088.00 - 6092.00] P:1468.51 E:0.089389 |  he had a spell away from the football club for other reasons
[6092.00 - 6095.00] P:1562.39 E:0.084726 |  and it was really tough and I thought he was, you know,
[6095.00 - 6097.00] P:1520.08 E:0.106686 |  could have been a key player at that time
[6097.00 - 6099.00] P:1501.73 E:0.097415 |  and hopefully he's in a good place
[6099.00 - 6102.00] P:1575.08 E:0.108673 |  and he can keep his football well and stay fit and healthy
[6102.00 - 6107.00] P:1526.99 E:0.105552 |  and he can give a good push with that number nine on his back for Burnley this year.
[6107.00 - 6111.00] P:1456.08 E:0.112323 |  Yeah, he was grimacing then as he was trying to race back in his own half.
[6111.00 - 6113.00] P:1815.37 E:0.114540 |  You could see him really putting in a shift.
[6113.00 - 6115.00] P:1885.63 E:0.103421 |  Yeah, he's done a brilliant shift so far for the team
[6115.00 - 6117.00] P:1719.53 E:0.110678 |  but it's only, there's still 15, 20 minutes to go.
[6117.00 - 6119.00] P:1540.80 E:0.101963 |  Obviously we'll have the extra time in the subs
[6119.00 - 6122.00] P:1554.44 E:0.090995 |  and obviously with the front-light but you need day players
[6122.00 - 6124.00] P:1370.69 E:0.089287 |  that are going to go and run through Hannibal.
[6124.00 - 6126.00] P:1607.06 E:0.111068 |  Looks like he's on his last legs as well.
[6126.00 - 6130.00] P:1593.33 E:0.088575 |  It's important that they, you know, button them maybe fresh enough at the moment.
[6130.00 - 6133.00] P:1709.95 E:0.105972 |  And Zolafe getting involved, plays it out towards the left-hand side
[6133.00 - 6136.00] P:1786.87 E:0.106612 |  as Sunland try and build on the edge of the Burnley penalty area
[6136.00 - 6138.00] P:1795.09 E:0.102805 |  but it is tight, it is compact.
[6138.00 - 6141.00] P:1743.73 E:0.102620 |  There is very little room for the runs of Sunderland
[6141.00 - 6143.00] P:1951.61 E:0.107854 |  and there's very little space to operate in Burnley.
[6143.00 - 6147.00] P:1810.55 E:0.099170 |  Move out towards the far side to try and close down Sunderland with Oliver's son.
[6147.00 - 6151.00] P:1823.67 E:0.098825 |  Now the cross comes in from Jacker, whips in at pace, headed up and away from Echdall.
[6151.00 - 6155.00] P:1698.49 E:0.104509 |  And Burnley now with Sunderland coming forward, might be able to get on the counterattack.
[6155.00 - 6159.00] P:1839.60 E:0.100064 |  It's just a little nudge down the left-hand channel for Foster
[6159.00 - 6161.00] P:1591.13 E:0.106450 |  by Anthony who continues his run.
[6161.00 - 6166.00] P:1705.22 E:0.108828 |  Foster cuts inside and lays it too far away from Jadon Anthony on the return
[6166.00 - 6169.00] P:1665.14 E:0.103292 |  and now with Burnley coming forward, maybe Sunderland can try and
[6169.00 - 6173.00] P:1773.70 E:0.109896 |  exploit a little bit of the space with Patrick Roberts who's already looking busy
[6173.00 - 6175.00] P:1756.40 E:0.095570 |  on the right-hand side, cuts in field.
[6175.00 - 6179.00] P:1740.26 E:0.101488 |  Now across the centre-circle, Burnley leading by a golden ill.
[6179.00 - 6182.00] P:1757.11 E:0.094521 |  Big 13 minutes ahead for both sides here.
[6182.00 - 6185.00] P:1777.05 E:0.099445 |  What it would mean to Burnley to get that first win of the Premier League season.
[6185.00 - 6189.00] P:1672.44 E:0.097613 |  What it would mean for Sunderland to continue their fine start from last weekend
[6189.00 - 6194.00] P:1649.81 E:0.103416 |  but behind as they are at the moment through Josh Cull and the captain's goal
[6194.00 - 6196.00] P:1599.40 E:0.097580 |  onto the edge of the penalty area.
[6196.00 - 6198.00] P:1705.69 E:0.116241 |  Here's Patrick Roberts now on the left and he's played through his ador.
[6198.00 - 6202.00] P:1860.86 E:0.107961 |  If it wasn't for the sliding interception and Maxime Esthev
[6202.00 - 6204.00] P:1813.10 E:0.114958 |  might have been through on goal but Esthev sticks a leg out
[6204.00 - 6206.00] P:1845.88 E:0.099273 |  and it goes behind for a Sunderland corner.
[6206.00 - 6208.00] P:1683.88 E:0.099057 |  Looks like he's struggling here Esthev.
[6208.00 - 6212.00] P:1546.00 E:0.104428 |  Don't know if it's Cramp or what but he said there's this Brown to roll him a little bit
[6212.00 - 6218.00] P:1698.68 E:0.089276 |  and Esthev actually reacts to the pass and he looks like he's got a bit of cramp.
[6218.00 - 6222.00] P:1493.01 E:0.096747 |  There's a few Burnley players now look like they're starting to tire.
[6222.00 - 6224.00] P:1548.35 E:0.093205 |  Some of the fans can't watch.
[6224.00 - 6226.00] P:1757.36 E:0.093262 |  Looking a bit nervous there.
[6226.00 - 6231.00] P:1718.55 E:0.101853 |  Yeah, it's a lot of nervousness isn't there within the crowd and within the supporters
[6231.00 - 6235.00] P:1784.71 E:0.092232 |  because they're 12 minutes away from a big result
[6235.00 - 6239.00] P:1643.60 E:0.099996 |  and ultimately got some added time on a couple of subs now getting made from Burnley.
[6239.00 - 6243.00] P:1702.59 E:0.104424 |  Yeah, well Esthev has got up and then sat back down inside the 18-yard box
[6243.00 - 6247.00] P:1715.85 E:0.105258 |  so important for Burnley because when they were last in the Premier League
[6247.00 - 6249.00] P:1573.50 E:0.109135 |  they only won two of their 19 home games.
[6249.00 - 6254.00] P:1667.31 E:0.095439 |  If they had any chance of survival they've got to win and they've got to win at Turfmore
[6254.00 - 6256.00] P:1677.24 E:0.118539 |  and they've got 12 minutes to hold on here.
[6256.00 - 6260.00] P:1681.31 E:0.100758 |  Yeah, good this rule now is that once the physios come on the pitch
[6260.00 - 6262.00] P:1751.10 E:0.093365 |  you need to go off now.
[6262.00 - 6265.00] P:1534.12 E:0.106825 |  Very, very tough time, tough place to come off now.
[6265.00 - 6267.00] P:1589.31 E:0.100557 |  Defending a set play.
[6267.00 - 6269.00] P:1723.06 E:0.107881 |  Especially one of their key defenders.
[6269.00 - 6271.00] P:1948.81 E:0.106092 |  This is a new rule this season.
[6271.00 - 6274.00] P:1707.19 E:0.103666 |  It's to try and limit players time wasting and feigning injury
[6274.00 - 6277.00] P:1671.72 E:0.110649 |  but as soon as they're down and the referee stops play for that injury
[6277.00 - 6280.00] P:1640.13 E:0.088445 |  physios have to come on and the player has to leave the field.
[6280.00 - 6284.00] P:1746.49 E:0.096688 |  I don't think there's any way that Maxime Esthev is feigning or faking this injury.
[6284.00 - 6287.00] P:1822.19 E:0.099990 |  It was a stretch maybe a stretch too far and he is in trouble
[6287.00 - 6290.00] P:1529.62 E:0.089144 |  but the problem for Burnley is he's so key at the back.
[6290.00 - 6293.00] P:1724.97 E:0.105282 |  They're absolutely going to be key but again they've got somebody like Zian Fleming
[6293.00 - 6296.00] P:1566.97 E:0.105677 |  that could possibly come on here who's a very good header of the ball
[6296.00 - 6300.00] P:1833.71 E:0.091740 |  and you know could go and fill that step role but they're going to be still down.
[6300.00 - 6302.00] P:1668.93 E:0.087555 |  They're going to be a man down.
[6302.00 - 6307.00] P:1811.57 E:0.095934 |  Sunderland I think are also going to make a change as well.
[6307.00 - 6313.00] P:1727.71 E:0.095655 |  Mark Giew is coming on for Habib Diara.
[6313.00 - 6319.00] P:1702.37 E:0.095343 |  Burnley's changes we think are chown-up and Zian Fleming to come on.
[6319.00 - 6323.00] P:1708.05 E:0.100003 |  Are they going to wait for this Sunderland corner first though?
[6323.00 - 6326.00] P:1760.70 E:0.098488 |  We'll wait and see. It's a short Sunderland corner from the left-hand side
[6326.00 - 6329.00] P:1709.82 E:0.105583 |  played to the edge of the 18-yard box, rolled back out to the corner taker
[6329.00 - 6331.00] P:1925.67 E:0.106156 |  and he goes at the near post, had a opportunity.
[6331.00 - 6334.00] P:1828.34 E:0.106110 |  Now the second shot which is blocked by Ekdal
[6334.00 - 6336.00] P:1653.48 E:0.100351 |  and bounces back out of the penalty area.
[6336.00 - 6340.00] P:1860.68 E:0.111585 |  Mark Giew was involved immediately there for Sunderland from that corner
[6340.00 - 6344.00] P:1713.62 E:0.103946 |  and very nearly scored as well if it wasn't for the deflected block.
[6344.00 - 6347.00] P:1794.79 E:0.113158 |  Yeah so get it head over there from Ekdal to get that touch and lot on.
[6347.00 - 6353.00] P:1474.92 E:0.108205 |  Just delays. Yeah, Hume trying to get the ball but Burnley still does to ten men.
[6353.00 - 6356.00] P:1740.18 E:0.108283 |  Esteve I think is trying to come back on. He's run off his injury.
[6356.00 - 6359.00] P:1685.67 E:0.095748 |  Here come Sunderland down the near side right
[6359.00 - 6363.00] P:1813.50 E:0.106936 |  and now the eyes do look to the far side to see if Burnley are going to make that change.
[6363.00 - 6366.00] P:1747.02 E:0.102271 |  No, because Sunderland have taken a very quick throw
[6366.00 - 6368.00] P:1674.60 E:0.108240 |  and we'll take you around what's happening elsewhere in the Premier League
[6368.00 - 6371.00] P:1712.79 E:0.107351 |  and the Football League very shortly, a step running on.
[6371.00 - 6375.00] P:1764.53 E:0.104573 |  Not swiftly, not smoothly, but he's on quickly into that back line.
[6375.00 - 6377.00] P:1736.66 E:0.093104 |  He's going to try and continue if he can.
[6377.00 - 6379.00] P:1560.93 E:0.085786 |  Yeah, it looks like he's got a cramp.
[6379.00 - 6381.00] P:1794.81 E:0.116678 |  The dual-warrior's no warm-up, are they going to make that change?
[6381.00 - 6384.00] P:1779.71 E:0.103109 |  Sunderland might try and exploit Esteve not being at 100%.
[6384.00 - 6387.00] P:1689.59 E:0.109915 |  Round the back of the ball is played to Mark Giew.
[6387.00 - 6389.00] P:1845.75 E:0.114301 |  Too much pace on it. De Brouker can come off his goal line.
[6389.00 - 6396.00] P:1765.15 E:0.099516 |  Make the save, nine minutes to go. Burnley leading by a goal to nil through Josh Cullen.
[6396.00 - 6398.00] P:1699.46 E:0.084583 |  Let's catch up with what's happening elsewhere.
[6398.00 - 6402.00] P:1760.87 E:0.104358 |  Chey Dunkely has put Chesterfield 2-1 up at Harrogate
[6402.00 - 6405.00] P:1740.50 E:0.119887 |  as De Brouker slices his clearance away under a bit of pressure from Giew.
[6405.00 - 6409.00] P:1688.26 E:0.106871 |  And it is out for a Sunderland throw, midway inside the Burnley half.
[6409.00 - 6411.00] P:1731.01 E:0.114842 |  Tram in that, 2-0 up at Crawley in League 2.
[6411.00 - 6415.00] P:1795.64 E:0.094264 |  Sorba Thomas has put 10-man Stoke 2-0 up at San Hampton.
[6415.00 - 6418.00] P:1821.78 E:0.117003 |  Here's Giew again, right-footed shot, wide of the right hand post, the near post,
[6418.00 - 6420.00] P:1833.65 E:0.100451 |  for which he was aiming.
[6420.00 - 6423.00] P:1826.87 E:0.111620 |  It was a step sliding in to put him off again.
[6423.00 - 6427.00] P:1819.65 E:0.100488 |  No touch from the Burnley defender, but behind it goes for a goal kick.
[6427.00 - 6431.00] P:1732.93 E:0.103388 |  Sheffield Wednesday have levelled against Wrexham 2-2 in the championship.
[6432.00 - 6435.00] P:1652.76 E:0.106068 |  Celtic 3-0 up on Livingston in the Scottish Premier.
[6435.00 - 6439.00] P:1755.28 E:0.105282 |  San Hampton now have one back, Taylor Harwood Bellis.
[6439.00 - 6442.00] P:1649.02 E:0.093646 |  So San Hampton 1-2 the later score.
[6442.00 - 6447.00] P:1925.45 E:0.113440 |  And also in the championship Norwich have had the deficit through Josh Sargeant, Norwich 1-2.
[6447.00 - 6454.00] P:1899.74 E:0.114498 |  Here come those Burnley changes then, with Med, Hannibal and Foster replaced
[6454.00 - 6457.00] P:1912.17 E:0.117114 |  by Zian Fleming and Loon Chowna.
[6457.00 - 6461.00] P:1916.52 E:0.114825 |  Yeah, good to be fair to the two lads who've run on empty.
[6461.00 - 6467.00] P:1863.07 E:0.114297 |  They're on the last legs, they step off with a cramp and Hannibal's done a brilliant job
[6467.00 - 6470.00] P:1843.54 E:0.118744 |  dropping in that right hand side at times.
[6470.00 - 6473.00] P:1865.94 E:0.115422 |  5-4-1 just a bit.
[6473.00 - 6475.00] P:1884.81 E:0.113216 |  Again, just trying to get energy in that world.
[6475.00 - 6479.00] P:1891.19 E:0.111850 |  Good organiser, good leadership experience in the Premier League
[6479.00 - 6482.00] P:1754.86 E:0.113214 |  and good stuff to have coming on.
[6482.00 - 6486.00] P:1813.59 E:0.113197 |  Joe Warrell who broke his foot last season, which really limited his game time.
[6486.00 - 6493.00] P:1738.78 E:0.107871 |  Brookingsfoot for a second time in his career, he's come on to replace the over-stretched Maxime Estève
[6493.00 - 6497.00] P:1587.92 E:0.082846 |  for these final, what, seven minutes or so for Burnley?
[6497.00 - 6500.00] P:1620.20 E:0.110567 |  Plus at a time, there'll be a considerable amount as well.
[6500.00 - 6505.00] P:1711.57 E:0.096712 |  Burnley 1, Sunderland 0, 5-sports extra, live at Turfmoor.
[6505.00 - 6509.00] P:1695.07 E:0.093252 |  De Brouker with no other players inside the Burnley half.
[6509.00 - 6511.00] P:1780.84 E:0.118943 |  He smacks that longer over the halfway line.
[6511.00 - 6515.00] P:1706.80 E:0.106319 |  That's how much Burnley just wanted away from their 18-yard box there.
[6515.00 - 6518.00] P:1606.94 E:0.109111 |  They're not interested now in trying to play the ball so much.
[6518.00 - 6521.00] P:1709.94 E:0.107528 |  It is keeping their penalty area clear.
[6521.00 - 6526.00] P:1585.72 E:0.088594 |  Bromley of level 2-2 against Notts County in league two.
[6526.00 - 6532.00] P:1606.47 E:0.093302 |  Ball currently on the halfway line, with Sunderland's Omar Alderete.
[6532.00 - 6538.00] P:1647.11 E:0.087255 |  The Paraguayan defender.
[6538.00 - 6543.00] P:1631.42 E:0.104673 |  You joined in the summer from Hitafe, having played in La Liga last season.
[6543.00 - 6547.00] P:1535.41 E:0.107897 |  Sunderland 1-3 kick, 10 yards or so inside the Burnley half, left-hand side of the field.
[6547.00 - 6549.00] P:1698.95 E:0.104287 |  Jacker is over it.
[6549.00 - 6555.00] P:1640.89 E:0.105658 |  Organisation from Joe Warrell instantly as Burnley's back line stands in a row on the edge of their D.
[6555.00 - 6557.00] P:1719.92 E:0.102856 |  Overcast at Turfmoor.
[6557.00 - 6562.00] P:1611.23 E:0.101224 |  The Sunderland fans still cheering along their team, down towards our right-hand side behind the goal.
[6562.00 - 6565.00] P:1736.71 E:0.101736 |  Jacker, left footed, lifted into the penalty area.
[6565.00 - 6569.00] P:1871.23 E:0.110963 |  De Brouker came off his line early, single punch away, single-fist punch away.
[6569.00 - 6574.00] P:1822.07 E:0.104151 |  Clears the danger now for Burnley, but Patrick Roberts' first to the loose ball comes back to Jacker.
[6574.00 - 6578.00] P:1682.14 E:0.094465 |  Had a look over to the left-hand side, turns it back in field.
[6578.00 - 6579.00] P:1174.75 E:0.062964 |  Reynildo.
[6579.00 - 6583.00] P:1725.95 E:0.103852 |  So Patrick Roberts on the right-hand side, he turns it round the corner.
[6583.00 - 6585.00] P:1769.80 E:0.096728 |  And now Traycum rips it in right footed,
[6585.00 - 6590.00] P:1765.60 E:0.101943 |  head-up flicked away by Kyle Walker over to the far side of the penalty area.
[6590.00 - 6593.00] P:1716.43 E:0.096765 |  Twist and a little turn and a dance in the feet of Enzo Lafe.
[6593.00 - 6597.00] P:1811.80 E:0.101605 |  Jacker, left footed, looks deep, is deep, bounces behind.
[6597.00 - 6600.00] P:1883.58 E:0.110596 |  Gold kick for Burnley, he's still leading.
[6600.00 - 6603.00] P:1771.23 E:0.109173 |  Good header from Kyle Walker, but great line there, organisation.
[6603.00 - 6605.00] P:1641.13 E:0.098588 |  And that's the thing about Joel Warrell.
[6605.00 - 6609.00] P:1631.86 E:0.091549 |  First half they get done after about a minute for that long ball.
[6609.00 - 6610.00] P:1884.21 E:0.103944 |  Dan Ballard gets his cup.
[6610.00 - 6611.00] P:1873.94 E:0.133296 |  Joel Warrell's organised.
[6611.00 - 6615.00] P:1944.89 E:0.109854 |  We can actually push the line further back so they can get that second ball and get that.
[6615.00 - 6618.00] P:1947.22 E:0.122860 |  So it was good leadership, good organisation.
[6618.00 - 6620.00] P:1906.94 E:0.120426 |  And he'll be talking people through the game,
[6620.00 - 6623.00] P:1912.12 E:0.108946 |  leading that back line for the last 10, 15 minutes of the match.
[6623.00 - 6625.00] P:1856.38 E:0.113510 |  But Dabrowski coming for that punch,
[6625.00 - 6629.00] P:1926.49 E:0.114569 |  gives the group and the team in the crowd good confidence as well.
[6629.00 - 6633.00] P:1900.66 E:0.115340 |  As Ian Plainley now does come on for Burnley.
[6633.00 - 6639.00] P:1881.08 E:0.116511 |  He's got away, but it is Lyle Foster who he has replaced.
[6639.00 - 6641.00] P:1885.81 E:0.119402 |  Crews unbeaten, recording lead two on the threat.
[6641.00 - 6643.00] P:1784.47 E:0.117895 |  Then they started the season with four wins from four,
[6643.00 - 6645.00] P:1886.50 E:0.115525 |  but Jillingham have scored late on.
[6645.00 - 6647.00] P:1772.18 E:0.104332 |  So they lead at Presfield.
[6647.00 - 6650.00] P:1739.65 E:0.108885 |  Peterbury united without a point so far in league one,
[6650.00 - 6655.00] P:1716.26 E:0.092183 |  have got an equaliser late on at home to Bradford City.
[6655.00 - 6659.00] P:1716.05 E:0.104626 |  And Wiccan are now back level against Reading in league one,
[6659.00 - 6661.00] P:1790.95 E:0.090005 |  so to a piece at Adams Park.
[6661.00 - 6663.00] P:1798.93 E:0.112853 |  Dabrowski with another long goal kick,
[6663.00 - 6666.00] P:1821.68 E:0.090511 |  high in the air over the top of the Bob Lorde stand.
[6666.00 - 6668.00] P:1707.17 E:0.100313 |  And it goes into the southern half here.
[6668.00 - 6671.00] P:1708.26 E:0.088540 |  They'll come back though with Sunderland wrestling for it.
[6671.00 - 6674.00] P:1802.17 E:0.108156 |  A little bit too harsh from Josh Leuron on the back of Enzo Lefe.
[6674.00 - 6676.00] P:1734.36 E:0.078867 |  That gives the Blackcats a free kick.
[6676.00 - 6678.00] P:1675.55 E:0.095535 |  Yeah, it was just a foul again.
[6678.00 - 6681.00] P:1633.63 E:0.098747 |  Fleming now giving them an outlaw, an outlaw,
[6681.00 - 6685.00] P:1646.75 E:0.093007 |  going in for the headers and long kicks, goal kicks.
[6685.00 - 6687.00] P:1643.78 E:0.100043 |  Lyle Foster put a great shift in,
[6687.00 - 6690.00] P:1635.70 E:0.093609 |  but now it's important that Fleming does the same job
[6690.00 - 6693.00] P:1535.43 E:0.094519 |  and sits and protects that midfield four
[6693.00 - 6694.00] P:1684.85 E:0.099708 |  and does a shift for the team.
[6694.00 - 6697.00] P:1558.83 E:0.104684 |  So it becomes frustrating for that Sunderland defenders
[6697.00 - 6699.00] P:1561.00 E:0.101387 |  and they'd not get an easy possession
[6699.00 - 6701.00] P:1631.98 E:0.108977 |  and being able to put the ball in the box.
[6701.00 - 6702.00] P:1498.31 E:0.120623 |  Four minutes to go.
[6702.00 - 6704.00] P:1893.62 E:0.093061 |  Burnley won Sunderland, Neil Josh Cullen,
[6704.00 - 6707.00] P:1906.82 E:0.111082 |  who scored in Burnley's final game the last time they were in the Premier League,
[6707.00 - 6710.00] P:1768.15 E:0.095287 |  and scored in their first game on the return this season.
[6710.00 - 6713.00] P:1897.62 E:0.108194 |  As for Sunderland, they don't travel well in August or September.
[6713.00 - 6718.00] P:1737.52 E:0.085138 |  They haven't won any of the last 24 away games in August and September
[6718.00 - 6722.00] P:1787.82 E:0.097362 |  in the Premier League last beating Bolton in August 2009.
[6722.00 - 6726.00] P:1615.87 E:0.097848 |  A point could be precious here as Echdall steps in
[6726.00 - 6728.00] P:1706.28 E:0.110912 |  and intercepts the ball on the inside right channel
[6728.00 - 6733.00] P:1776.10 E:0.099395 |  at the Burnley 18-yard box, cleared away by the home side.
[6733.00 - 6736.00] P:1535.43 E:0.106736 |  And Sunderland are able to retain the possession,
[6736.00 - 6741.00] P:1708.11 E:0.099217 |  get it back again with Omar Alderete up and across the halfway line.
[6741.00 - 6743.00] P:1880.76 E:0.088826 |  Fleming goes and chases him down.
[6743.00 - 6746.00] P:1733.19 E:0.108698 |  He rolls it out towards the left hand, touch line.
[6746.00 - 6748.00] P:1816.54 E:0.103790 |  Walker cleverly steps in front of his indoor.
[6748.00 - 6752.00] P:1775.32 E:0.119429 |  Now Burnley themselves are looking forward with a lovely sweeping move
[6752.00 - 6753.00] P:1699.54 E:0.119059 |  and Anthony is in here.
[6753.00 - 6758.00] P:1771.53 E:0.120702 |  Goalkeeper off his line, Anthony rounds, roofs and puts it in.
[6759.00 - 6762.00] P:1783.28 E:0.131159 |  Slides on his knees in the corner flag
[6762.00 - 6767.00] P:1829.68 E:0.120116 |  and Burnley will win their first home game back in the Premier League.
[6767.00 - 6772.00] P:1865.36 E:0.123914 |  As Sunderland were pushing for an equaliser, Anthony Bro round the back.
[6772.00 - 6775.00] P:1852.55 E:0.128280 |  He was one on one, roofs made the early decision to come out
[6775.00 - 6780.00] P:1808.24 E:0.122703 |  as Anthony rounded in and powered it home down the middle of the goal.
[6780.00 - 6783.00] P:1886.43 E:0.116349 |  And it's Burnley too, Sunderland nil.
[6783.00 - 6785.00] P:1791.19 E:0.118739 |  Yeah, brilliant, brilliant counterattacks from Burnley.
[6785.00 - 6789.00] P:1779.67 E:0.118310 |  Kyle Walker stepping in, wins the tackle, plays it in.
[6789.00 - 6793.00] P:1833.76 E:0.120514 |  Back Josh Cullen plays a first-time pass straight in behind Tre Hume.
[6793.00 - 6796.00] P:1829.70 E:0.112501 |  And Anthony's first touch, Jadon Anthony's first touch is perfect.
[6796.00 - 6799.00] P:1848.59 E:0.119274 |  He goes and he gives you a long distance from the defender
[6799.00 - 6801.00] P:1619.92 E:0.128449 |  and then he goes round the goalkeeper
[6801.00 - 6804.00] P:1843.93 E:0.114433 |  and he does brilliant just to lift it into the top of the goal
[6804.00 - 6806.00] P:1808.77 E:0.117326 |  and get Burnley too now.
[6806.00 - 6809.00] P:1739.32 E:0.101493 |  What a wonderful counterattack from Burnley there.
[6809.00 - 6811.00] P:1684.11 E:0.125225 |  The lone player made permanent in the summer,
[6811.00 - 6815.00] P:1776.71 E:0.105221 |  stamps a permanent victory you would feel for Burnley
[6815.00 - 6818.00] P:1757.18 E:0.106030 |  with a couple of minutes left of the 90.
[6818.00 - 6821.00] P:1801.35 E:0.104060 |  It was slick, it was pacey.
[6821.00 - 6823.00] P:1712.39 E:0.111907 |  Anthony once he was round the back of the defender,
[6823.00 - 6825.00] P:1801.69 E:0.112692 |  you'd always fancy him.
[6825.00 - 6827.00] P:1889.17 E:0.120626 |  Still had a bit of work to do when he got round the goalkeeper.
[6827.00 - 6830.00] P:1846.24 E:0.108680 |  That's a lovely finish, but I love the ball from Josh Cullen.
[6830.00 - 6832.00] P:1768.82 E:0.123012 |  He's just played the end between there.
[6832.00 - 6834.00] P:1828.81 E:0.105143 |  Sorry, he's got a nice jacket, actually, he plays it in between them.
[6834.00 - 6836.00] P:1706.86 E:0.110191 |  And it's a brilliant finish from Anthony,
[6836.00 - 6840.00] P:1581.17 E:0.106671 |  but it's a great relationship that they have him and Scott Parkoff had.
[6840.00 - 6842.00] P:1663.80 E:0.119298 |  They've known each other since we were at Bournemouth days
[6842.00 - 6845.00] P:1657.70 E:0.099042 |  and he's done a great job for them, isn't he?
[6845.00 - 6849.00] P:1545.53 E:0.110075 |  Bringing them here and the numbers were brilliant last year
[6849.00 - 6852.00] P:1554.94 E:0.093418 |  in terms of goals and assists for the team
[6852.00 - 6854.00] P:1652.13 E:0.116820 |  and then ultimately making a permanent this year.
[6854.00 - 6858.00] P:1537.40 E:0.102850 |  To get that goal in the Premier League and give them Burnley a two-goal lead so far.
[6858.00 - 6860.00] P:1718.48 E:0.124265 |  Something might make it nerve-y.
[6860.00 - 6862.00] P:1797.95 E:0.110375 |  We're about to learn how much added time in the next minute or so.
[6862.00 - 6863.00] P:1670.07 E:0.123511 |  There'll be quite a lot of it.
[6863.00 - 6866.00] P:1786.36 E:0.101875 |  We had a stoppage for VAR, we've had stoppage
[6866.00 - 6869.00] P:1814.35 E:0.116026 |  for the foot-light issue as well.
[6869.00 - 6871.00] P:1797.17 E:0.121046 |  Then we hack it deep into the Sun and a half.
[6871.00 - 6874.00] P:1753.79 E:0.101371 |  Behind it goes for a goal kick.
[6874.00 - 6878.00] P:1797.00 E:0.108531 |  Elsewhere, QPR have one back, but it's still Coventry City seven.
[6878.00 - 6880.00] P:1770.68 E:0.107136 |  QPR one.
[6880.00 - 6886.00] P:1792.52 E:0.110493 |  Swindon have been pulled level by Shrewsbury one-one at the County grounds.
[6886.00 - 6892.00] P:1832.03 E:0.111841 |  Full time's coming in, Mark Chapman will have your full review on sports report on five live.
[6892.00 - 6897.00] P:1817.96 E:0.122367 |  Josh Cullen, man of the match, a goal in an assist
[6897.00 - 6899.00] P:1890.54 E:0.110921 |  and I don't think anyone will have any good points.
[6899.00 - 6900.00] P:1894.82 E:0.114355 |  Absolutely not.
[6900.00 - 6903.00] P:1651.79 E:0.102650 |  And again, his leadership again and talking about picking up second balls and that.
[6903.00 - 6907.00] P:1566.51 E:0.102850 |  But the other side of the game, showing that quality, that passing behind
[6907.00 - 6909.00] P:1679.34 E:0.092859 |  Jacke was phenomenal.
[6909.00 - 6914.00] P:1535.65 E:0.117041 |  And it was a great finish there from Jad Nantney to give them that two-goal cushion.
[6914.00 - 6916.00] P:1593.22 E:0.105487 |  But there's plenty of time, it's going to be added on here.
[6916.00 - 6918.00] P:1594.39 E:0.120482 |  I'm hearing, ten minutes.
[6918.00 - 6919.00] P:1740.40 E:0.091495 |  Wow.
[6919.00 - 6924.00] P:1660.69 E:0.120131 |  So maybe it is not done yet as the fans in the cricket grounds stand here at Burnley.
[6924.00 - 6928.00] P:1654.51 E:0.108568 |  Lot there, hands in the air singing the Burnley Club anthem.
[6928.00 - 6932.00] P:1750.12 E:0.101090 |  Sunland fans a little quieter now than they were.
[6932.00 - 6940.00] P:1774.08 E:0.104184 |  Backwards header, works out for Burnley and DeBroukha, just lets that go over the byline for a goal kick.
[6940.00 - 6942.00] P:1779.54 E:0.107396 |  Ten minutes has gone around them to have more.
[6942.00 - 6946.00] P:1728.99 E:0.099181 |  Fans a little nervous, but their side have a two-nil lead.
[6946.00 - 6949.00] P:1665.44 E:0.100855 |  Yeah, it's obviously because of the floodlights, but also again,
[6949.00 - 6953.00] P:1543.59 E:0.099574 |  subs that have been made, it's frustrating, but now Burnley have to get control,
[6953.00 - 6957.00] P:1572.68 E:0.115110 |  get organised, who's the leaders in the team that are now going to get you through that.
[6957.00 - 6961.00] P:1522.69 E:0.108391 |  That score is going to be that middle of the team is going to be important.
[6961.00 - 6965.00] P:1608.30 E:0.091701 |  Walker, Worrow, Ektal and Cullen.
[6965.00 - 6971.00] P:1612.84 E:0.118308 |  Zian Fleming, can they get a team and organise them, get good distances, good two compact goals.
[6971.00 - 6972.00] P:1782.16 E:0.108599 |  Foul given.
[6972.00 - 6975.00] P:1649.95 E:0.116473 |  Alderete there for no reason, just shoulder bad them.
[6975.00 - 6979.00] P:1505.42 E:0.119086 |  Chown her down and looks in some serious discomfort,
[6979.00 - 6980.00] P:1724.80 E:0.114503 |  that's frustration from Alderete.
[6980.00 - 6984.00] P:1530.42 E:0.104425 |  Yeah, that's all that is, he's just tried to bump them in.
[6984.00 - 6986.00] P:1554.94 E:0.126586 |  If you're Burnley, you're delighted with that, aren't you?
[6986.00 - 6991.00] P:1583.77 E:0.111994 |  Grab the pitch, put Sunderland under a bit of pressure.
[6991.00 - 6994.00] P:1722.88 E:0.118824 |  So, free kick to Burnley, that'll run down the clock a little bit more as well.
[6994.00 - 6998.00] P:1748.42 E:0.116284 |  The first minute of ten has gone, if you're a Burnley fan, leaving the ground earlier, if you have,
[6998.00 - 7003.00] P:1644.34 E:0.102678 |  you can listen back to the goals on BBC Sounds if you want as well.
[7003.00 - 7009.00] P:1630.18 E:0.111273 |  Finally, five sports extra dial and you'll be able to rewind Josh Cullen's goal
[7009.00 - 7011.00] P:1729.51 E:0.106964 |  right at the start of the second half and then just moments ago,
[7011.00 - 7016.00] P:1881.16 E:0.111013 |  Jaden Anthony has made it 2-0, over in the corner on the far side.
[7016.00 - 7021.00] P:1759.15 E:0.111988 |  Chown her as one Burnley, a corner as well, again, there'll be no rush to take it,
[7021.00 - 7025.00] P:1661.44 E:0.102145 |  they don't need to, but it'll be another set piece here for Burnley,
[7025.00 - 7027.00] P:1581.24 E:0.105705 |  who look like they're going to put this into the penalty area,
[7027.00 - 7030.00] P:1732.61 E:0.102608 |  they're not keeping it in the corner, flagged by any stretch,
[7030.00 - 7037.00] P:1732.94 E:0.100173 |  there are plenty, Claret shirts inside the Sunderland, 18-yard box away to our right-hand side,
[7037.00 - 7042.00] P:1518.21 E:0.090553 |  our left-hand side rather Joe Warrell's up there, Anthony Tuzzi and Fleming,
[7042.00 - 7045.00] P:1606.28 E:0.111468 |  Echdall's gone up the defender, it is a short corner from Burnley,
[7045.00 - 7049.00] P:1703.50 E:0.096809 |  taken by Chowner, will he then choose to swing it into the box on his return,
[7049.00 - 7051.00] P:1811.21 E:0.106310 |  he lays it back to Kyle Walker over to the touchline,
[7051.00 - 7055.00] P:1732.22 E:0.088251 |  now Chowner does left foot across it in, Echdall gets a foot to it,
[7055.00 - 7058.00] P:1853.74 E:0.104945 |  but it's taken all the pace off it and runs through for Robin Williams.
[7058.00 - 7062.00] P:1717.52 E:0.102701 |  It's a hard decision isn't it really, because you've got ten minutes or eight minutes to go,
[7062.00 - 7065.00] P:1560.62 E:0.102559 |  you want to try and keep it in the corner, but there's still plenty of time to go,
[7065.00 - 7069.00] P:1610.20 E:0.094828 |  so I think sometimes you just got to put it in the box, keep your routines,
[7069.00 - 7073.00] P:1632.39 E:0.096593 |  and then when you get to that last two or three minutes, then you can keep it short.
[7073.00 - 7076.00] P:1700.84 E:0.113398 |  Swindentown have gone in front against Ruzbe, they were pegged back,
[7076.00 - 7080.00] P:1687.26 E:0.105019 |  but not for long, Billy Bowden seems to have won it for Ian Holloway's side,
[7080.00 - 7085.00] P:1771.02 E:0.103288 |  Mansfield have got four now against Layton Orient in the league one,
[7085.00 - 7091.00] P:1910.25 E:0.102557 |  all the full-time's drifting in, we'll keep you across it on five, sports extra,
[7091.00 - 7099.00] P:1689.63 E:0.100982 |  and of course on five live sport, where Brentford still lead Aston Villa by a golden ill,
[7099.00 - 7106.00] P:1652.66 E:0.106249 |  Bolton in the 97th minute through a Tom Hamer-owned goal of got an equaliser against Lincoln City, 1-1.
[7106.00 - 7110.00] P:1602.90 E:0.107404 |  Earlier today in the Premier League Manchester City, beaten at home by Tottenham Hotspur,
[7110.00 - 7114.00] P:1687.39 E:0.099636 |  two in from two for Thomas Frank to start his reign with in the Premier League,
[7114.00 - 7118.00] P:1699.30 E:0.108071 |  Flickton down the right-hand side, Burnett could be in again here,
[7118.00 - 7124.00] P:1671.67 E:0.090252 |  and as Ian Fleming is trying to make his way into the box, it's just held up for now by Josh Laurent,
[7124.00 - 7129.00] P:1704.03 E:0.103651 |  into the corner they go, now they're going to hold it up, and they played it cleverly off Omar Alderetta.
[7129.00 - 7134.00] P:1845.62 E:0.108879 |  It's good play, taking little bits, getting up there, getting thrown, getting cornered,
[7134.00 - 7140.00] P:1604.54 E:0.091348 |  taking the sting at the game, but it's been a great second half from Burnett, isn't it?
[7140.00 - 7145.00] P:1547.27 E:0.099332 |  I thought they've really come out that second half, scored the early goal, but organised, disciplined,
[7145.00 - 7149.00] P:1558.09 E:0.098235 |  and got that second goal on the counter-tie, but they have to be focused now,
[7149.00 - 7154.00] P:1491.44 E:0.098524 |  when things are getting tight, bodies are getting tired, there's a ball that they're really concentrating.
[7154.00 - 7161.00] P:1654.33 E:0.093216 |  Ian Fleming on the turn, might have been caught there, but the referee didn't have any hesitation in waving it away.
[7161.00 - 7166.00] P:1774.61 E:0.111357 |  Someone trying to come forward, it's a poor pass from Trafium infield, and Channer intercepts.
[7166.00 - 7170.00] P:1692.06 E:0.100818 |  Now here's Anthony, score of Burnley's second goal, close on the 90 minutes,
[7170.00 - 7176.00] P:1794.52 E:0.103857 |  Burnley leading by two goals to nil, six minutes to go, still about in time, ten minutes were shown,
[7176.00 - 7182.00] P:1775.85 E:0.096117 |  and Burnley leading Sunderland to make sure that all the three promoted sides,
[7182.00 - 7186.00] P:1756.76 E:0.099298 |  and a lot's been made of the three that have come up over the last two seasons,
[7186.00 - 7191.00] P:1668.78 E:0.095027 |  have gone straight back down, all three promoted sides will be off and running with a win,
[7191.00 - 7193.00] P:1767.34 E:0.106895 |  if Burnley hold onto this team a win.
[7193.00 - 7198.00] P:1476.23 E:0.082496 |  That's a positive for the three teams that have come up.
[7198.00 - 7204.00] P:1450.97 E:0.098497 |  I thought the three teams that went down this year were really, really poor in terms of the return that they had,
[7204.00 - 7211.00] P:1517.93 E:0.090250 |  so it's important that Burnley and Sunderland and Leeds have gone,
[7211.00 - 7215.00] P:1561.50 E:0.097804 |  but I think it'll be a bigger point to stay up this year as well.
[7215.00 - 7218.00] P:1804.60 E:0.128995 |  Sunderland crossing from the left-hand side, too much pace on it, nowhere near a black shirt,
[7218.00 - 7222.00] P:1908.62 E:0.107374 |  behind it goes for a goal kick, the other promoted side in action this evening,
[7222.00 - 7227.00] P:1702.69 E:0.095175 |  Arsenal against Leeds on five live sport from 5.30.
[7227.00 - 7236.00] P:1483.03 E:0.090922 |  Goal kick to Burnley, to Browker, the 36-year-old Slovakian signed in the summer from Newcastle.
[7236.00 - 7241.00] P:1420.86 E:0.107000 |  Just sure got to keep clean sheets last season, but there's cat one today,
[7241.00 - 7246.00] P:1559.18 E:0.103855 |  a couple of important saves in the first half, it has been a contrasting game of two halves,
[7246.00 - 7250.00] P:1607.89 E:0.105950 |  it's been a minute to be so cliche, Sunderland were better in the first, Burnley better in the second.
[7250.00 - 7254.00] P:1594.63 E:0.092322 |  Yeah, absolutely, I think you're absolutely spot on there.
[7254.00 - 7258.00] P:1685.60 E:0.095377 |  Sunderland had the best chances in the first half, big moments,
[7258.00 - 7262.00] P:1496.75 E:0.096375 |  but Burnley come out second half and real impetus to their play,
[7262.00 - 7265.00] P:1478.71 E:0.114096 |  Wally getting that early goal helped them, but they've shown good moments.
[7265.00 - 7269.00] P:1794.18 E:0.105985 |  Chowder from range, wide in the left-hand post,
[7269.00 - 7273.00] P:1915.04 E:0.119074 |  Burnley had it on the left-hand side, and Chowder on the edge of the deal
[7273.00 - 7278.00] P:1864.29 E:0.113606 |  and he's going into a low ball, cut across field, and he whacked it with everything he'd got,
[7278.00 - 7280.00] P:1632.41 E:0.099298 |  left-footed, it wasn't far wide.
[7280.00 - 7284.00] P:1736.29 E:0.089698 |  It's very close, they get it, ball in for Hartman, and he just swings his left forward,
[7284.00 - 7288.00] P:1564.10 E:0.108000 |  how's he actually seen the post? It's a brilliant effort.
[7288.00 - 7292.00] P:1827.16 E:0.111288 |  Central position, it roosts, it's flat-footed, he could only watch and hope it went wide, it did.
[7292.00 - 7298.00] P:1747.00 E:0.087028 |  Six minutes of the 10-outed on has gone, Chowder in possession again,
[7298.00 - 7302.00] P:1820.81 E:0.107376 |  just outside the centre-circle, inside the Burnley half, the Clarets right to left
[7302.00 - 7306.00] P:1707.73 E:0.104136 |  and he's closing stages as he's played down the middle to Josh Lorano,
[7306.00 - 7310.00] P:1768.52 E:0.094464 |  just poking out towards the left-hand side, Chowder tries to cut in field,
[7310.00 - 7316.00] P:1582.55 E:0.103038 |  this time it is read well enough by Ray Nildo, and it is a free kick as he goes down in the aftermath
[7316.00 - 7318.00] P:1519.12 E:0.113246 |  on the edge of the Sunderland penalty area.
[7318.00 - 7323.00] P:1593.20 E:0.105078 |  Sunderland rolled into Chowder there and he tries to overlap him, it's 96th minute,
[7323.00 - 7327.00] P:1607.75 E:0.108556 |  you're two and a lot, just stay in your position, leave your winger 1v1, let him go,
[7327.00 - 7331.00] P:1629.06 E:0.094991 |  don't be overtaken and you give a foul away, and all of a sudden now you've got to track 60 yards back the pitch.
[7331.00 - 7335.00] P:1668.16 E:0.109268 |  It's important now that Burnley just take control of the game, get organised,
[7335.00 - 7337.00] P:1618.67 E:0.087758 |  get disciplined, keep the distances good.
[7339.00 - 7343.00] P:1713.51 E:0.105176 |  Patrick Roberts for Sunderland, middle of the Burnley half, central position as well,
[7343.00 - 7347.00] P:1802.42 E:0.110476 |  it's pushed onto the edge of the D, challenges come in,
[7347.00 - 7350.00] P:1775.09 E:0.110821 |  Zian Fleming tries to get to the second ball, he can't, here's Ray Nildo,
[7350.00 - 7356.00] P:1594.81 E:0.092966 |  out towards the left-hand side, Roberts now offers his support inside of the left-hand touchline,
[7356.00 - 7361.00] P:1623.56 E:0.094133 |  Granik's jacket, the captain of Sunderland, not a lot he can do to drag his team over the line here
[7361.00 - 7366.00] P:1923.07 E:0.115988 |  as Roberts tries to feed it on through, but unsuccessfully so, friends, Ole Fay.
[7366.00 - 7372.00] P:1747.72 E:0.092684 |  Sunderland throwing however, with two and a half minutes left of the 10 that were added on,
[7372.00 - 7380.00] P:1742.94 E:0.109831 |  Burnley two, Sunderland nil, over to the left-hand side, it goes again, Ray Nildo in field,
[7380.00 - 7383.00] P:1628.90 E:0.113799 |  Sunderland have to score now if they want to set the nerves around this place,
[7383.00 - 7387.00] P:1874.90 E:0.096019 |  some Burnley fans think it's done as they head down the steep steps towards the exit
[7387.00 - 7392.00] P:1604.29 E:0.100444 |  and back through the concourse here, Sunderland fans will be hoping the boss engines have started up already,
[7392.00 - 7398.00] P:1810.27 E:0.100570 |  ready to get there, back across the M62 and up the A1, to Brauka,
[7398.00 - 7402.00] P:1666.45 E:0.106745 |  bounces the ball a couple of times, referee's put his hand in the air to say,
[7402.00 - 7408.00] P:1702.02 E:0.096433 |  five seconds left of your eight seconds that you're allowed to Brauka, caught out by that last week,
[7408.00 - 7413.00] P:1562.64 E:0.097106 |  making a smooth exit of the ball from his hands this week, certainly,
[7413.00 - 7416.00] P:1580.11 E:0.109088 |  as the referee started to count him down, raising an arm in the air,
[7416.00 - 7421.00] P:1698.60 E:0.103981 |  Jacke on the edge of the centre-circle, Burnley two, Sunderland nil, five sports extra,
[7421.00 - 7426.00] P:1647.37 E:0.093760 |  from a dry, a mild, but a cloudy turf more this afternoon.
[7426.00 - 7430.00] P:1833.77 E:0.095178 |  Tough challenges ahead for Burnley, Manchester United at Old Trafford next week,
[7430.00 - 7436.00] P:1625.12 E:0.100088 |  then they've got Liverpool and Forrest to come, Manchester City away before the end of September as well,
[7436.00 - 7439.00] P:1518.75 E:0.090001 |  never a miserable record at the Etihad Stadium.
[7439.00 - 7443.00] P:1710.36 E:0.114406 |  The ball, bounces into the air to Brauka, chooses to punch rather than catch,
[7443.00 - 7447.00] P:1781.91 E:0.094716 |  and then that allows the low shot from Lefey into a crowd of players.
[7447.00 - 7455.00] P:1699.41 E:0.092117 |  Joshua Laurent got the block in, and it can't be kept in play either by Oliver Son on that far side.
[7455.00 - 7461.00] P:1617.69 E:0.092933 |  So corner kick here to Sunderland, on their far left-hand side,
[7461.00 - 7466.00] P:1595.96 E:0.097827 |  in front of those Sunderland fans as we roll into the final minute of our time,
[7466.00 - 7469.00] P:1768.07 E:0.095144 |  a packed, congested, six-yard box.
[7469.00 - 7473.00] P:1734.06 E:0.093097 |  It's got to be perfect, this delivery from the far side, it is whipped in at pace,
[7473.00 - 7479.00] P:1709.73 E:0.102319 |  and he's pulled back onto the penalty spot, a swing, really, with not a clear connection from Alderate,
[7479.00 - 7482.00] P:1778.55 E:0.096451 |  Burnley have it on the near-side touchline, and clear it long.
[7482.00 - 7487.00] P:1659.33 E:0.097391 |  Yeah, good defensive play there from Burnley, and now they're in the counter-attack again,
[7487.00 - 7490.00] P:1747.59 E:0.096567 |  into Cullen, just keeping the ball.
[7490.00 - 7492.00] P:1646.31 E:0.104813 |  Cullen and Anthony combining that.
[7492.00 - 7496.00] P:1776.92 E:0.102067 |  Two goal scorers this afternoon, Josh Cullen right at the start of the second half,
[7496.00 - 7500.00] P:1513.35 E:0.080486 |  and Jade Nantini, right at the end of it, really.
[7500.00 - 7503.00] P:1611.41 E:0.118009 |  Here he is playing the ball back towards the halfway line, smashed away by Ekdal,
[7503.00 - 7507.00] P:1731.32 E:0.098745 |  under a little bit of pressure from Mark Eubat.
[7507.00 - 7511.00] P:1804.46 E:0.100077 |  Anywhere will do for Ekdal in that scenario, seconds remain,
[7511.00 - 7515.00] P:1766.86 E:0.101311 |  and I imagine there'll be a huge cheer from the Burnley fans,
[7515.00 - 7518.00] P:1839.74 E:0.111247 |  starved of success really here last time in the Premier League,
[7518.00 - 7522.00] P:1879.90 E:0.107731 |  but they made a winning start this time around, they're leading by two goals to nil,
[7522.00 - 7526.00] P:1996.77 E:0.108385 |  Sunderland over towards the halfway line, now the whistle start,
[7526.00 - 7531.00] P:1871.47 E:0.116968 |  they realise the clock's running into the 100th minute, there goes the full-time whistle.
[7531.00 - 7536.00] P:1941.64 E:0.108345 |  Burnley back in business in the Premier League.
[7536.00 - 7542.00] P:1948.74 E:0.109116 |  They get a two-nil win, over the side they came up with last season in Sunderland,
[7542.00 - 7548.00] P:1934.49 E:0.113522 |  a better second half from the Clarets, who started quickly through Josh Cullen's goal,
[7548.00 - 7556.00] P:1926.08 E:0.103620 |  and were then doubled in lead thanks to Jade Nantini, right at the end of the second half as well.
[7556.00 - 7562.00] P:1879.68 E:0.108720 |  For Sunderland it was a satisfactory first half that they just couldn't build on.
[7562.00 - 7566.00] P:1901.13 E:0.118140 |  They changed to their front line, but as Burnley solidified and went to a back five,
[7566.00 - 7570.00] P:2003.46 E:0.111545 |  it became increasingly harder for Regis Labrisis' side,
[7570.00 - 7576.00] P:1936.29 E:0.108198 |  but Scott Parker, Edges closer and closer to 100 wins as a manager,
[7576.00 - 7581.00] P:1952.66 E:0.110521 |  he's yet to lose at Turfmort, and the Premier League's not going to stop that record either.
[7581.00 - 7585.00] P:1944.91 E:0.109629 |  It finishes here, Burnley two, Sunderland nil.
[7585.00 - 7589.00] P:1814.34 E:0.113726 |  Yeah, brilliant performance, two halves, totally different bit again.
[7589.00 - 7593.00] P:1716.20 E:0.123717 |  It's really important when you come back up to the Premier League from the Championship,
[7593.00 - 7596.00] P:1792.00 E:0.116514 |  they've done a brilliant job last year, how quick can you get that first win,
[7596.00 - 7601.00] P:1756.83 E:0.127551 |  and you can see it, how much of a lift is giving the support already,
[7601.00 - 7605.00] P:1830.18 E:0.123990 |  and really important that they just keep focusing on what the job and what to do.
[7605.00 - 7608.00] P:1829.11 E:0.124010 |  One game at a time, that's all that matters.
[7608.00 - 7612.00] P:1811.38 E:0.121344 |  Yeah, of course, there's things you have to improve on and you'll get better as the season goes by.
[7612.00 - 7616.00] P:1704.64 E:0.125488 |  There's still another week of the window as well, which could be really important.
[7616.00 - 7621.00] P:1714.51 E:0.121648 |  So, for Burnley, some big three points in terms of we've got the first one on the board,
[7621.00 - 7624.00] P:1839.71 E:0.124415 |  but now can we build on that and choose the night against Derby,
[7624.00 - 7628.00] P:1622.88 E:0.116019 |  and can we then go again away at Manchester United Saturday?
[7628.00 - 7632.00] P:1761.13 E:0.122825 |  Scott Parker congratulating his players, it's a big hug with his captain,
[7632.00 - 7635.00] P:1722.96 E:0.123698 |  Josh Cullen is celebrating the birth of a new baby this week,
[7635.00 - 7640.00] P:1790.50 E:0.120231 |  Kyle Walker exchanges words with Granik Zjaka inside the centre circle.
[7640.00 - 7643.00] P:1875.28 E:0.118006 |  The Burnley players all with big smiles on their faces,
[7643.00 - 7647.00] P:1816.66 E:0.117797 |  a couple of Sunday players bent to their knees on the full-time whistle.
[7648.00 - 7653.00] P:1822.87 E:0.117112 |  Burnley are off and running, Sunderland's bright start last weekend is dented.
[7653.00 - 7657.00] P:1846.53 E:0.102630 |  They'll go again next weekend when the host Brentford in the Premier League,
[7657.00 - 7660.00] P:1953.61 E:0.035515 |  and I'm sure the stadium alike will be rocking.
