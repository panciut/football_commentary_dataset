  "transcript": " ...shadow Messi and then Jordi Classie was given that option to try and nullify the little magician. But we're underway. The Dutch are playing from left to right, straight away. Our referee tonight, who is from Spain, Antonio Maseo giving a free kick in favour of Argentina. But the atmosphere is sensational, isn't it? Yep, the Argentinian fans at this World Cup really brought that, the noise and the passion into the stadiums. It was here again this evening in the loose sale. It was one of those when the Amphems actually took their headphones off just to try and listen to the 50,000 Argentinian supporters singing it with real emotion. And still the white and sky balloons, sky blue balloons are being bounded around and knocked around in that end away towards our right hand side. Little stumble from Arkay, sees it back towards his goalkeeper, Andreas Knopper, huge figure of a man all in green, 6'8\". The keeper from Heron Bay, now at the back, it's with Ottenberg. Amazing story, isn't he? Knopper, really surprised pick in the Dutch squad, but he's had a pretty steady tournament so far. Hakunje, stocky, short, dark hair, left wing back. He was quite happy for Lisandro Martinez to try and come forward there, but at the minute, Martinez is just a normal to just stay here and then it's with Ottenberg across towards Christian Romero. This is Messi dropping deep. Brown certainly like that, as it's now with Romero. Ball played to McAllister. Chance to drive forward, Hakunje. With a cut back, getting forward on this near left hand side, and DeRome was there to clear it away for the Netherlands. 0-0, two minutes play. I think it's fascinating that Argentina are set up and they're matching up against the Dutch. They've been 4-4-2 or 4-3-3 throughout this competition so far, shows their flexibility, but there's a show a bit of fear as well. Scoloni. Scoloni is the youngest head coach at this World Cup at 44 and he's up against Van Hal. The 71-year-old now in his third spell in charge of the Netherlands. I'm sure you're more than well aware that it was back in April when it was revealed he was having treatment for prostate cancer. There's a documentary that is going to be all about Van Hal. And even actually if you recall the final qualifier, he was in a wheelchair because he had actually broken his hip at that time. So he's certainly got a great deal of resilience and he's here in this quarter final and yet to lose in a World Cup game as well. Louis Van Hal, the master against the 44-year-old who has certainly revitalised his Argentinian side. But there is a clash of heads, Gakpo is down. The Spanish referee is just going to make sure he's okay. It's Enzo Fernandez and Gakpo just coming together. Both players nice focus firmly on the ball. It was okay. The referee is going to give an uncontested drop all here. I think he's just going to drop it for Ake and then Ake will hit it long downfield. Play back under way. Four minutes play. As it is he spreads it across the back. Timber goes back inside towards Van Dijk. It's pretty much all the Dutch have done in these opening exchanges. Pop the ball across the back. De Jong closely shadowed by De Paul, isn't he? Argentina get the ball and Messi charging forward out towards that right-hand side. The cross comes in. De Paul hits it. Strikes Alvarez and the Dutch threw it in. And then it's a little flick away. Certainly you could hear the excitement inside the Luceo Stadium when Messi picked it up. He popped it out to the right-hand side. Molina though wasn't a good cross. So Paul crossed from either side so far. The Argentinian wing backs. Molina is actually getting a little bit further up the field on that right-hand side. Can you stay quite tight on this near side the left? He's not wanting to venture too far forward but Molina, who plays for Atlético Madrid, was getting quite high and he had the covering presence of Topman's Christian Bramero. De Jong. Back it goes towards Van Dijk. This is the sixth World Cup meeting between the two. Only Brazil, Sweden and Argentina against Germany have played more often in the history of the World Cup with seven. So much history and recent meetings tend to be low-scoring affairs. It's a throw to Argentina on this near side the left. Cunha is going to take it. Go away from Enzo Fernandez. Cunha then takes the ball back to Alessandro Martinez. Here is the Manchester United player and he will switch play out towards Bramero. He's playing on the rise of the three. Forward ball. Looking to turn to try and get Molina forward on that right wing back roll. Acado tied his up and then very cruelly cleared by Nopper, the Dutch goalkeeper. De Rune stretching, bouncing ball, Messi knotted on. Looking to try and get it into the path of Molina but it's going to be picked up by Nopper. Seven minutes played, Neil Nielsen. We haven't seen Nielsen near enough from the Dutch attackers. De Pye playing up top with Burgwein, his preferred partner, Louis Van Halen. That hasn't always been the front line in this World Cup. And Aless chopped and changed with Gack Pochus. And that was drawn roll behind the front two but doesn't think he's had a touch yet. Here is Van Dijk coming forward. Central position of that back three. De Jong, tibetal figure of course. Frankie De Jong for the Dutch. Timber. And Fries is ahead of him. Touch there from Burgwein. The Rune able to turn the form of Middles for a player. He's outside the centre circle of his own half to Acke. A careful patient play this from the middle. Yes it is and that's another area where Van Halen's chopped and changed. That position alongside Frankie De Jong in the middle. Rune this evening has been Coopminers. Burgues. Yeah, Burgues played in the first game against Senegal. Coopminers came in. That was a almost mistake from the doctor. That was a no-no from Noppert. Just a little cushion past out to the right-hand side. But Alvar has nearly got onto that. Dumpfries on this right-hand side to Burgwein looking for the return ball to Dumpfries. Down towards the violin he goes, keeps the ball in play. And we'll win a throw down by the corner flag for the Dutch. We've been playing for just over eight minutes. Dumpfries with two assists and a goal against the United States. And the little ball played by Memphis Depaille towards Gatko goes out of play for a goal kick. I've got to say I've been really impressed with Denzil Dumpfries in this World Cup. It's like an Olympic 400 metre runner powering down that right-hand side. A couple of assists in the goal against the USA. Messi runs away from three orange shirts, passes the ball out towards Molina on that far side. Argentina now coming forward. This is Fernandez outside the centre-circle, cross to the near side, the left foot, Acunha. Acunha goes back to the centre of Martinez. And now to Ottimendi. They switch it across the three defenders, Romero, over the halfway line forward. A little bit of a touch there for Depaille. Back it goes out towards that right-hand side. Alvarez is just at the minute waiting in a central area. De Jong is keeping his eyes firmly fixed on Lionel Messi. Scoloni, the Argentinian coach out in that technical area down below. He wanted the ball played long there rather than across the back once more. The ball running forward to Molina, early cross, headed away by Van Dijk, off the chest by Messi, looking for a shooting opportunity, plays it to Acunha. And that was a wayward cut back from the left-hand side. It enters the penalty area, really pulled it away. He did the job for the Dutch, did Acunha inadvertently. Do you know what? I think I'm right. It was a couple of the game against Poland. He had an awful night. Final ball was woeful. He started poorly again, had a couple of... But in a really good couple of positions to cross the ball and hurt that Netherlands back line, but real lack of quality. Whilst Chris was talking again, it's one of those... I hope the atmosphere is coming home on the radio to you. The level of support here. 50,000, it's staggering. It is, and we were here early and watching the Brazilian Croatia penalty shoot out and there was a number of Argentinian fans who were in the stadium earlier. Quite enjoyed Brazil going out. Yes, Croatia await after Brazil, missed two penalties and losing their quarter-final. It'll be the first semi-final, actually here in the city of Luzal, which is about nine miles north of Doha. It's a bit unsporting, wasn't it? Well, they're not concentrating about Brazil now, are they? Just bouncing up and down in unison. The stadium is jumping. 0-0. It feels like a proper football match, doesn't it? We've seen a few Mexican waves at various games, which... It's a fair to say, in a little bit forced a bit. A bit corporate. Real fans tonight. Proper atmosphere. 12 minutes play. Of course, tomorrow, Morocco, Portugal at three o'clock and then England, France at seven. All the build-up from 5.30. Of course, five-life sport on air from mid-day, but the concentrated build-up at half-pass five from Marc Chapman and the team inside the stadium, the Albatte Stadium. But this is Devlin's nil, Argentina nil. And Ottomendi goes out towards the right-hand side. This tight, cagey affair is exactly everything that I thought it would be. McAllister in the centre-circle. Out to Acunha on this near-side, the left. Acunha looking for the return ball. McAllister controls it and then sends over the cross from the left-hand side, picked up by De Paul, right corner of the area, and then it's just caught with ease by Noffert and the goalkeeper. It's a really good run. The left-hand channel by McAllister. One touch in across the ball, but... That's a strong challenge, there. That was Christian Romero going in, and the Spanish referee calls him to him and takes him away from everybody else for the Tottenham player. Oh, he does get the ball back. He does an half-take. A piece of the pipe at Argentinian back three. Romero, Ottomendi, Martinez, rough and rugged. Street fighters. Free kick for the Netherlands. De Jong is going to take it. Messi was actually having a word with the Spanish referee. He's still not happy from where he's going to be taken. It's just outside the centre-circle, and De Rón gives it back to De Jong. Blonde-haired midfielder. Back now with Acunha. Left to the centre-circle. Timber just inside the Dutch half. Van Dijk waiting for it. Is Blintover on that far side. Passes the ball forward. Move-al break down. The pie will try and chase after it, but Argentina have comfortably seen it back to their goalkeeper, Emi Martinez. That crucial save late on against Australia in that frantic finish. There he did. A big moment for Argentina. Similar to the Dutch, he found a way. We haven't seen any of the Dutch centre-half step in at all at this moment in time. When they're in possession, they're a 3v2. Just keeping their shape. Diagonal ball hit forward for the runner Valveres. When we said before, though, about when they met in 2014, and it was the semi-final in South power, they were a little bit more on penalties in Brazil eight years ago. We said about them shadowing Messi, that Van Halen this occasion doesn't appear to have gone for a man-marking job on it, as Timber comes forward and it's inside to Gatpo. Vergwein out towards Memphis to pie with the cross. Dumfries at the far post, lifted back into the danger area. Blink was there. He goes down under a challenge. Argentina get it away towards Fernandez. Still they'll nail first real sign that the Netherlands took them to kind of cause Argentina some problems. Yeah, but this has been the Netherlands at this World Cup, hasn't it? Those moments where they just counter, where they pounce. Dumfries, sort of terrific World Cup there. Being that threat as the ball fed to the far post, a little right foot cushioned volley. And daily Blink, they linked up for a goal against USA, didn't they? Yes they did. He wasn't far away, got up in the ball, and just over his head at the far post. The crease on that a night. Obviously, it was off his weaker foot, actually, for daily Blink. Swept it in off his right foot, but sort of on crease when he was at PSV. And even whether he's a right back, right wing back, he just likes to get forward, very attack minded. But this system certainly suits him. To do exactly what he does, and he's playing so high on this near side at the moment. He's taking a cuneque back with it, as Argentina try and win the ball in the midfield. De Jong slides into a challenge. It's a good 50-50 between De Jong and Los Andro Martinez. He's a little fireball, isn't he? Good hold back then. Two former Ajax players, of course. Martinez, the Ajax player of the year. Last year, 17 minutes play. Last season, should I say. There's Van Dijk. Members to play on the halfway line. Runs it. Almost hands it over to Blink, inside to De Jong. Coming in the pressure from the ball. Helped out by De Jong. Back with Van Dijk. Nice gentle walking pace from the duck. Timber over the halfway line, looking for the run of Bergwein. Good anticipation from Neymar, Martinez the goalkeeper, all in red. Accelerated off his line, made the smothering save. Yep, and that's the first time really, we've seen one of the three duchess end to half, step in in that right-hand channel. Timber slides a ball in. Bergwein with a run. Not far away. Good goalkeeping from Martinez. Alvarez tries to get away from the challenge of De Jong. He then runs it to Timber and De Jong. He's pushing the back from Alvarez. De Jong. He went through his own half. He'll go back to Van Dijk. And now to Acke. Acke and Anakke. Both of them. Five starts now in this competition. Just tweaked it every now and again as Van Hal with that back line. Acke certainly benefiting from the switch to three, the Manchester City player. Stayed high out on that far side of the left. Now they work it back inside towards De Jong. Messi though is doing the chasing. Blint forward to Pylots. It runs through, bounces away off the knees of Romero. Comes towards De Jong, clips it across to Timber, takes it off the chest, over the halfway line. And it's still goalless here on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds. As Bergwein, the referee gives a free kick. It was for a challenge to Fries on Acke. I think that that's harsh. Fries saying, come on, what did I do, Rom? The junior actually puts his arm across him and stops him. Fries trying to play a little give and go. One, two, with Bergwein. The way these two teams set up with the wing backs, those jewels in the wide areas. From the Bresa and the Cunha, Lina and Blint, they're going to play a big part, have a big bearing on this game. Whilst you were talking there, Chris, did you notice that the Spanish referee, Antonio Matiu, had a word with Di Maria? Clearly Di Maria have said something out of turn on the substitutes bench for Argentina. And the one thing when I've seen this Spanish referee in Champions League games, he takes no nonsense. Something might say a fishes. He certainly, and I thought he calls the players, he says to the players, you come here. You're in left and low in certain terms, who's in charge? It's like working with your good self. Yeah, I don't mind that. Bit of authority, no where you stand. 20 minutes played. Yet to have a serious chance on goal from either side. OK, listen forward, De Pye makes the run. Ottenendis gone with him into the penalty area, holding him, not allowing him to turn. And then when De Pye just tried to roll in, Ottenendis gets the right foot in and it goes behind, and out for a quarter kick. There's a good run from De Pye in that left-hand channel. And he backs into Ottenendis, used his body well. Tried to roll in, but Ottenendis getting a big toe to the ball. The whistles and the cheers, because it's a Dutch corner kick, which is taken short. From the left-hand side, headed out, and then De Jong will look to try and head it out towards that far side. Gakpo prongs it forward, little touch there by De Pye. Ake tries to return the ball to him, and then it's brought away by Molina. Molina trying to get forward on that right-hand side, and the Argentinian support. Although, did you hear a little chant of Holland Holland of the effects bike? No. For the first time tonight, I actually heard Dutch voices. All-place forward. Alvarez makes the run, and Dike manages to get it away. Out of the way, Ake. Out of the go for a throw to Argentina, Lilnith. Alvarez will do that when there's space in behind. He'll make those runs in behind the Dutch backs, Ray. But Dike took an unnecessary risk there. Messi, brilliant put-work. Messi with a shot, and left foot, it couldn't keep it down. Under a full moon in La Salle, Lionel Messi just couldn't quite find the range, and it was no danger to Nopper. Really good feet from Messi, though. Drifts through the Dutch midfield, 25 yards out, tries to bend the ball into that far corner, far top corner. We're approaching the midway point in the first half. Here on BBC Radio 5, Durón finds De Jong. It's an elegant midfielder, up to Gatpo. Clear, lifted that away by Fernandez in the midfield for Argentina. Blint. De Jong will make sure that he got there before Messi, and now Nopper, all in green, comes out of his goal. He plays a short forward ball towards Van Dijk. They don't. Black passion is Argentina's support, and they certainly have an abundance of energy. As once again, the arms are being thrust into the air, jumping up and down, and certainly creating a wonderful noise. De Fries couldn't get on the end of it. It will be an Argentina throw on this near side, as Argentina is now in the lead. Argentina throw on this near side, as Argentina played from right to left. They continue to take it, not much movement for it. Hardly any movement whatsoever at all down there. The referee surely going to have to tell it to hurry up. Eventually it's taken, and it comes back to a severe player, but then they lose the ball, and it's with Van Dijk. There is a lot of respect between the two, isn't there? Yep. Absolutely, and Argentina don't have that big physical presence up top. Defy to Burgwein, comes back towards Burgwein, and he's practically shot wide. Little bit fortuitous how it came to him at the second time of asking, but it was well off top. Good signs though, to the Dutch. Front to linking up, they like to play together. The guy's favourite partner, Burgwein. Burgwein pops a little ball in too many. Outsiders right foot, boot, plays it round the corner, it's lifted, and it's a poor effort in fact. 20 yards out, left footed, pulls it wide. Fanching before about that semi-final in Sao Paulo, that finished goalless in Argentina, prevailing 4-2. That was the second semi-final, 24 hours after Brazil were humiliated in Belo Horizonte by Germany. Brazil are out, they've lost on penalties themselves tonight. But the long history between these two nations, they also played 2006 in the group stage in Frankfurt, and it was 0-0. Three goals in the last four games. Just imagine if Argentina scored. It's like they said 0-0. If you've walked into the stadium now, you could be forgiven for thinking that they had scored, judging by the noise and the actions of this vast Argentinian support. They're on the attack now, de Paul. Laid off by McAllister. Alvarez keeps it alive, Acunha, and Alvarez run into each other, and it breaks down, and Alvarez goes for a throw. That was a good challenge. Timber. Right-sided, centre-back, all the Netherlands on Alvarez. Time to perfection. I wouldn't say calling Mystic Meg, but the other day I was messaging our editor, and I said Spain are going to lose this on penalties. And then I was making a prediction about this game, saying this will go the whole hog as well. And I've seen nothing in the opening 26 minutes to suggest otherwise. Yeah, right, you know, I get that, but has this sort of opening 25-26 minutes epitomised both teams in this tournament, but then there are those moments, the messy moment against Mexico. Enzo Fernandez, who saw the Dutch total football goal, didn't we? One under the pitch to the other against the USA. If it does come off, I think I might put the lottery numbers on for the weekend. I don't tend to do the lottery at the moment. Looking to hit the jackpot for Argentina at this World Cup, and certainly little messy hoping that this year will be his year. Tonight he's making his 24 World Cup appearances, level with Miroslav closer. So only now Lota Mateus has actually played more World Cup games than Lilo Messi. Stupid challenge from the Gank Pope. Not to mend a long ball from Nathan Ackie in behind the Argentine-Potinian backline, and he just pushes him over. Half-challenge. You're listening to Five Live. That's Chris Sutton. As Emi Martinez has pulled his clearance out to this near side there left, playing from right to left, approaching the half-hour. So Tom Fries to take the throw. He's been told to go back by the referee to timber on the halfway line. Now with Van Dijk. Van Dijk will run forward. As it goes to Ackie on that left-hand side, De Jong is quite deep. Girona's there as well. Glyn tracking back on the halfway line. Tom Fries is forward on this near side, the right. But this is a very, very cautious Dutch performance. This is in KG. The strikers Bergmeiden, De Pye, really split. Occupying the wide centre backs of that Argentinian back three. Gac Pope playing deeper. Doesn't really go on the ball this evening. Gac Pope's forward ball. Bergmeiden controls it with his right foot. Plays it to Tom Fries on the right-hand side now level with the area. Gac Pope chips over the cross. De Pye and Glyn for both there. Around eight yards out, cleared. De Jong lifts it a long way back, rides up onto the chest of Van Dijk. And now Giron takes over, rides the centre circle. Timber loses it to the Callister. Fernandez, messy. Challenge comes in from De Jong. Messy holds on to it. And now gives it to Romero. Molina's ahead of it. Inside now to De Paul. Messy's joining the attack. Macaste lets it go underneath his right foot as a result. There's a little bit of the momentum that they were building there, Argentina. Here is De Paul. Fernandez. He had that conversation last night on the preview show. Is it four or six? Well, it's the Cinco, the five-roll. The Argentinians that deep-lying midfielder that Fernandez plays. Benfica midfielder. It's now Messy once again just outside that centre circle. De Paul. The Netherlands have got every orange shirt back behind the ball once again. Fernandez. Fernandez plays the ball out towards that far side of the right. Back inside it goes towards De Paul. He was trying to wave. Ottomendi to come forward there. Ottomendi now just run forward. Challenge by McCallister. Cassandra Martinez unable to keep the ball in play. Argentina refuer is there. Here we go. Here's the referee. Some again has said something out at turn. It does well to hit. His hearing was excellent, by the way. One of the coaches has been showing a yellow card. You said he's no nonsense, Ian. What is no nonsense in Spanish? We'll find out for you. Cinco Mierras. You sure? Sometimes you can... I like that, though. I've probably got a yellow card for my pronunciation. Depirement. I think yellow's generous. Fernandez runs forward. De Jong goes with it. Releases the ball to Molina far side. 14 minutes to go to halftime. Looking to Alvarez. De Paul wins it. Back for Argentina. De Paul inside. Alvarez with his back to goal. Trying to slip it into the path of McCallister. Messi's just lurking, loitering, waiting. And here he is, 30 yards out from goal. Finds McCallister with his back to goal. Looking to turn. De Rowe staying tight behind him. McCallister. They were nibbling McCallister. The referee's playing the advantage. He's making that decision. That's a good decision from the referee. Fernandez out wide. It goes to the right. De Paul once again comes onto the ball. Every outfield player now is in the Netherlands half. Here is Osamendi. Passed out by Fernandez. Messi now running onto the ball. Being tracked by De Jong. Alvarez a heavy first touch. Presents it to Gakpo who runs forward. This is where the Dutch can strike. D'Amphrice cut out though by Isandro Martinez. Now it's with McCallister. And McCallister accelerates over the halfway line. De Paul plays the ball forward. Molina pulls it back. McCallister turns. De Paul tries to place it right footed. And he went for placement rather than power. And it was a comfortable save by Knopper. Yeah, real lack of conviction with the effort eventually. They work it well. Argentina on the turnover. And as the ball is weighted back to De Paul, it's only 20 yards out. He goes safe with the inside of his right foot. Got a go for Broke there. Put your foot through the ball. Was that the first shot on target? Probably is actually. Certainly. Scoring opportunities have been few and far between the two teams. And it's a fervent atmosphere. Five live, 11 minutes to go to half time. And we are still 0-0. On this Friday night and tomorrow, Morocco, Portugal and then England, France at 7 o'clock. The championship is back tomorrow. Nine games for the football league. Back in full swing. Five live sport from 12. Rick Edwards and Emma Saunders presenting live from the soup in Doha. Messi, thread the ball through. Messi looking for the breakthrough goal. And Argentina have got it. Argentina through Molina. His first goal for his country. Finding the bottom left hand corner. The Argentinian supporters are delirious. Messi with a delightful ball. It pierced the Dutch defense. And it was Polto. Netherlands 0. Argentina 1. He doesn't have so many moments of influence now. Because he's getting on a bit messy. But this is genius. Just creates a little bit of space against Nathan Ackay. And reverses the ball. Onto Molina. Who takes a brilliant first touch. Left footed. Van Dyke tries to put him under pressure. And then with the outside of his right boot. Finishes brilliantly. Plus the giant Noppert in the Dutch goal. What a ball. What a finish. And the Dutch need to respond. What an awful time to bring your first goal for your country. If you've ever tracked his career. He's used to scoring goals. Eight last season for Udenaise. Now plays his football at Atlético Madrid. But for a player who broke into the side during Argentina's successful Copa America. He took it so well. But the through ball from Messi. Yep. Amazing, amazing pass. Eyes in the back of his head pass. Most players wouldn't see that ball. But then he has to wait the pass perfectly. And boy does he great run by Molina. And there's a brilliant first touch with his left foot. Took it into his stride. And then just stayed composed. Noppert. Close the angle. Outside of the right boot. And listen to this. I'm deliberately not saying anything. For five seconds. Close your eyes. And just think of every man, woman, boy and girl. Decked in a blue and white striped shirt. Jumping up and down. And throwing their arms in the air. Whether it be the balloons. The flats. Scarves. Shirts. And there's now a stoppage in play. Here to Paul. He was a round coming into the game, wasn't he? He was, but I think this is a head injury. To Paul back on his feet. But we know how head injuries have been treated. Throughout this tournament. Once again. Not really given a thorough check. That they carry on regardless. Play a welfare. I'm afraid. Seems to have gone out the window at this World Cup. We've got seven minutes to go to half time. The Netherlands nil. Argentina won. And now the Dutch have a bit of a problem, don't they? They're set up to counter attack. They're going to have to be braver now. Show some Dutch courage. I'm beaten in 19 since Louis van Haal. Took over for his third stint. As a CUNY was trying to get forward here. But Dumfries did just enough to see the ball back. He's won 14 and he's drawn five of his 19 games. Louis van Haal. But now the 71 year old. We heard earlier on about there are a number of Dutch journalists who are not happy about the style of football that the Netherlands are playing. They're now going to have to attack. They're now going to have to raise their game. They've been quite cautious in what had been a tight first half. But it was Argentina who had been probing and messy. Unlocked the Dutch defence. That was a slack ball by the goalkeeper to De Jong. So now they are going to have to change their tactics the Dutch. Listen, it's okay being ugly Dutch. If you're winning. Here is Alvarez. Alvarez to Messi. Messi looking to turn in the penalty area. Messi does turn. Low right foot is shot. No real pace on it. And a comfortable save from Nopper. Argentina with a better team. They absolutely are. Alvarez left hand side of the box. The ball into Messi. And it's twisting one way. Twisting the other way. Get a little half yard. Fires the shot off right footed. Comfortable from Nopper. Messi's name was just reverberating around the stadium here in La Salle. Idolised. Here is Dumfries. Trip. And that was a foul on Gatbo. And it will present the Netherlands with a free kick. 25 yards out. Right of centre. 5 minutes to go to halftime. Just careless from Enzo Fernandez. Back for the right hand channel. Back to goal. His heels clipped. And the Dutch produced something from this free kick. And Dijk's gone forward. Gatbo is going to take it if it's right footed. If it's the in-swinger, it will be Blintoppe's left. Argentina leading 1-0. They've got a two-man wall inside the penalty area. Very high line from Argentina. This. Gatbo lifts his arms in the air. He's going to leave it for Nopper. Leave it for Gatbo. It's right footed. Curled in. And the referee has spotted. A clash between a couple of players. But it was a header out as well. I don't know about you. I feel quite tired just looking at the Argentinian support. The nerve working hard. Dear me. What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... What a... Pleasure it is to be here. What a racket. It's a lovely racket. For being on as some of the atmospheres at this World Cup have been quite flat. Not an Argentina plate. Just think. If they get to the semi-final or indeed the final, if there's 50,000 in Qatar now, you could double that. They will travel en masse. They travel in such numbers anyway. As Ake's over on that far side, he has to go back to Wurtanoppe. 6'8\", goalkeeper Klerz left footed downfield. And Ottenendy just lifted out towards that far side. And we have three minutes to go to halftime. Hooks away back by Molina. And it will run through to the Dutch keeper. We all thought Brazil would throw earlier, didn't we? We went Neymar, put them ahead. We didn't get the job done. I think from a Dutch point of view, they haven't given the Argentinian backline enough to think about. The strikers are split. Didn't they link up once? The effort from Bergwein, which is off target. There is Bergwein out to them, three's. The right wing back. He's lost the ball to the junior, the Spanish referee has given a free kick in favour of the Netherlands. And now he's shown a yellow card to Jürien Timber. So the Dutch defender, despite the Netherlands getting a free kick, he's the Bournemouth shown yellow. He's saying for an earlier push, Timber, but Timber lands a yellow. And there's one, I think, is that Cunha as well? He's just shown another yellow card. And then there's Cunha, who's received the yellow card. Well, if that's the case, that rules him out at the semi-final. So Cunha now will miss the semi-final, should Argentina go through. And he's having words with the referee. He's not going to rescind it now. Do you know what? Seeing the challenge on Dumfries, there's a really poor challenge. And then what happens is, after the challenge, Timber isn't happy. And there's a Cunha, who goes over, pushes him over. That's why he's all yellow. Cunha rakes his right boot in the back. Dumfries's Achilles is a really poor challenge. Dumfries up, hobbling. So it's a free kick to the Netherlands, who trailed by a goal to Niel. And it's a very high line from Argentina. And then he's going to bring the out in from the right. Blint and Gatpo are going to take it, but they've offered so much protection here to Elie Martinez. Free kick then. Blint leaves it for Gatpo once again. It's swung in, but Dac was there. Achilles at the far side to try and head it back, and then balled away by De Paul. What a ball that was. Really tempting. I think it was Romero, who got his head to the ball. He's a little bit of a defender. Romero, well, that's handball. It's ridiculous Romero. What's he thinking of? That's volleyball, that is. Just instinctively brought his right arm up to squat his away. It's a ridiculous decision. Romero, little back heel from De Pye. He's going over his head and a big Argentinian fist coming in. Piping the ball away. It's like he was playing tennis. Go to serve and volley. 60th. Win the 45th minute. Free kick. Curled in. Golcuba and in Martinez's safe hands, diving down. What it does mean though is that you've now got Romero and Acunha. Little bit of niggle out there as well now inside after that challenge. There was Acay and Acunha. Acunha just had a little tug there of Acay. Maybe so. Acay had run on the inside of Enzo Fernandez and they're coming together. Acay went down. Martinez gathered. He's not been worked enough though. Demi Martinez. Comfortable evening for him so far. Louis Van Hal, the iron chulip. I've worked to do it half time. They certainly haven't been blooming in this first half, that is for sure. Five additional minutes in the second half where Argentina are leading by a goal to nil. Noel Molina. But Messi with the assist. Lovely through ball. Timber. Square to Van Dyke. Still hasn't been or doesn't appear to have been a shift in the way that the Dutch are playing. It's still slow, still a little bit predictable. Haven't seen Frankie D'Yong and they have got on the ball. Good on the ball enough and dictate who he is now but not as many touches as he would have liked. That's a stupid challenge from Alvarez. I mean he should see yellow. Here's another one though. The Dutch dug out this time. Is it Veghorser? He's got incredible hearing. Or he's a good lip reader in many languages. He's now shown a yellow card to each bench. Veghors has been shown yellow. Why is he not shown one to Julian Alvarez for that? Because that's a yellow card offence just clipped. Timber over. Timber was fouled. There was no attempt to play the ball by Alvarez. What you've got to say though is that we've just seen in the last few minutes as D'Yong hits a flat forward ball. Gatpo's glancing header goes through to Emi Martinez. He drives forward. With the lack of discipline by Romero and then Alvarez and a little bit by Kunja. Would that worry you? Yeah of course it would. Yellow cards. They need to keep 11 men on the field if they want to go through. 11 men on the field. They certainly got the 12th run. In the stands. Was it 1998? Ortega? He saw Red, Burkamp scored. Not a Newman was... Not a goal too late to hit yet. Newman sent off 10-12 minutes before that. Yeah we talk about the history between the two. I mean obviously 78-98. The way that Burkamp pulled down that long searching ball. One touch and then right footed, clipped it in. In Marseille in the sunshine. Here we are in the desert. One of the dark skies at Doha. Argentina are leading by a goal to nil. Although they've not beaten the Dutch in open play in their last six games. No. They're due. They're due. They do a break. The five minutes have added on time. They're almost over. Netherlands nil. Argentina won. Molina's goal 10 minutes before half time. Here's the difference. And the Dutch and they are going to need to put in an improved second half performance. It's okay. It's okay being pragmatic. But you've got to have a punch and the Dutch haven't landed. No foul or messy. Referee coming under huge pressure from the vast Argentinian support. And Scolodi down below with his arms out, stretched wide. A lot of occasion. Spanish referee keeps his cards in his pocket. De Pye out towards the far side of the left for Blint. Square ball. Blint then is, as he checks off the ball. The referee says no. Blint, shake of the head. And it runs out of play for a goal kick. Blint playing that first time. Trying to make the run. Not enough contact. Goes down too easily. He's better than that. Maybe Blint haven't seen enough of him this evening. They look at great a threat. The Dutch down the right hand side. By my watch, the five minutes, he lapsed about 60 seconds ago of additional time. As the clearance from Emi Martinez goes straight out of play. When I said he was a fishess, at times he does make it all about himself as well as this Spanish referee. And once again, he's had a little glance at his watch. My way, or the highway. Here at the heart of the Argentinian defence is Christian Romero back towards Emi Martinez. Asandro Martinez drives it forward. Alvarez. Head down, actually strikes him on the back. And it's cleared away by Van Dijk. And there is the half-time whistle. And not that they pause for Brad. The Argentinian supporters cheer off their heroes because Messi with the assist. And Molina with his first goal for his country, giving Argentina a precious lead. And one moment in the first half, Masterful from Messi, how he saw the pass, let alone play it. Who knows? Wonderful pass that it was reversed into the marauding Molina, who took a wonderful first touch and finished beautifully. And that's the difference in this first half. I do think Argentina have just edged it with a touch in this second half. They're going to have to bring more to this party. Half-time here in La Salle, Netherlands 0, Argentina 1. Kelly. Thank you very much, Chris. Lionel Messi assisted five goals in the World Cup knockout stages. Since Opte have started having the numbers on World Cup assists, since 1966, this is the most on record in the knockout rounds. And that go pass, Kelly's record of four. So adding salt into the word for Brazil, who exited the World Cup at the hands of Croatia earlier. Lionel Messi says Stap Mandade now has seven World Cup assists in total. Only Diego Maradona has more for Argentina with eight. We already know that Messi is up there with the legends of the game. And as you said, the quality of that assist for Molina was incredible. But Argentina throughout this tournament have played in moments. There just seem to have been more moments in that first half than what we've seen in previous games. Yeah, I think that's really well put. They haven't dominated games, but getting out of the group stage, it was about little messy moments. Enzo Fernandez came on and influenced the game. Having said that, they blew away Poland. They weren't great when they got the better of Australia. But he's the player everybody looks up to. Not in size, of course, but in stature. And he doesn't influence games like he used to. But it's just a couple of seconds, got the better of Aki. But then to spot the ball, we don't just associate dribbling with Messi, but it was such an incredible spot. But then you have to get the weight of pass-ride. Molina had made a superb run. And then his first touch was, I'm not saying Messi liked, but it was a brilliant first touch, because he was under pressure from Van Dijk, who was trying to recover and get back at him, but he couldn't and he finished it so, so well. And that, essentially, is the difference in the first half. I can't really remember another shot. I know De Paul had a really tame effort, but that's been the difference, that one moment from the magician. Yeah, look, I don't agree with Chris, you know, what he just said. It's just like, it's almost like, we said it before, the game kicked off, we already said he's going to get a moment, and you see him scaling before he gets the ball. And then the moment when he gets the ball, it's almost like he gives him a, like, we call it now a no-loop pass. Like, he's not even watching him clearly, but he already saw him from before. And that's why, when you look at Holland, I think the biggest problem we'll be having now is that we are not dangerous up front enough. Why are we not dangerous enough? Is because in the middle of the park, there's a lot of people that are worried about if he can close the line with the ball towards Messi, and he has to do a lot more backtracking than the other way around. And I think the two strikers up front, how many danger have they created yet? You know, Berg, Ryan and De Pye, because I think they so focus on how we can lock them up, and so they become a disadvantage, Argentina. But Argentina is only waiting to see, like, when can we get Messi on the ball to get him close to the goal, because that's how they set up. They set up to wait, wait, wait, wait until they get them to a position where they can influence Messi. And the rest of the team, they just work for him like we said it before. So I feel Holland has to do a lot more. Dumfries did some stuff, but I haven't seen Blin yet trying to attack the game. Mario, thank you very much for now, Mario, Milioc, Chris Sutton, where there's alongside Ian Denison in the Lusail stadium. We're going to have lots more reaction from Brazil's defeat at the hands of Croatia. They went out on penalties in the early kickoff, and that means that Croatia will face the winner of this game between Netherlands and Argentina. Tomorrow it's all about the other side of the draw.

We're at the La Sale stadium this evening where Argentina lead Netherlands by a goal to nail it came from Alina the assist, the beautiful assist was from Leonel Messi. We've got second half commentary of that match still to come and of course the winner of this game will face Croatia in the semi-finals because they knocked Brazil out on penalties. We'll get more on that and we'll hear from Garry Southgate very shortly. But away from the World Cup today on day one of the second task between Pakistan and England, leg spinner Abra Ahmad took the best figures by any spinner on his test debut with seven for 114. The host bowled out England for 28 and it meant by the end of the day they'd trailed by just 174 runs and ended on 172. Now that was in stark contrast to the opening day of the first test and the unresponsive pitch in Ralf Pindi. Jonathan Agby was watching this one with the TMS team. Yeah, it has been a very different sort of match here, much more even contest between bat and ball which has spun almost from the word go not too much but just enough to suggest that as this pitch wears there's going to be more for the spin bowlers as the game goes on. So spin bowler Alex Hartley sitting alongside me, it's always nice to see something a little different isn't it Alex? It is and that is exactly what Abra is isn't it? He's completely different the way he holds the ball the way he bowls his variations it's just something that we haven't seen before and the fact that spin was brought into play in the ninth over of the game and the first ball beat the outside edge we just knew it was going to be a good day we thought the wicket was going to spin they rolled it in a really peculiar way they put grass cuttings, dead grass cuttings at each end of the pitch and rolled them sideways so we knew the pitch was going to offer something not necessarily as much as it did I just love the look on Ben Stokes' face too I mean he had that ball absolutely covered as far as he was concerned and when he heard it hit the stumps I mean his jaw just dropped. He did have never seen Ben Stokes look so surprised we've seen him in the last few test matches he's played laugh when he gets out because he's been playing some expansive shots he was trying to defend this ball from Abra and it literally went through his defences Abra said after the game that that was his favourite wicket and rightly so but also because Ben Stokes is his favourite player well there you go just thinking you know England 117 for 1 ok they were still pushing along playing this very positive game that they played to be 117 for 1, 281 all out they'd have wanted more than that were they batting first in these conditions? yeah of course they would have wanted more I think you're right saying 350 they would have taken probably anywhere between 330 to 350 so they have fallen short by surprise the most is that Mark Wood at the bottom of the order was actually going along really nicely and he was finding the boundary with ease and then Jack Leach his first ball he played the reverse sweep shot and got bold and then Jimmy Anderson you can sort of forgive Jimmy a little bit more because it's his genuine scoring shot he plays it time and time again but you think if you're trying to get up in around 300 when you feel like you're could be slightly short on what is a tricky wicket could somebody have just stayed around with Mark Wood a little bit longer? I think at the moment then Alex Barba remains on 61 they've dropped Azar Ali their most experienced test batsman which is well it gives others a chance but maybe a bit of a surprise so early in the series where are they going? 174 still quite a lot of runs to get yeah they've still got quite a lot of runs to get if England can pick up early wickets tomorrow spin's going to be key so I think we're going to see a lot of Jack Leach, Joe Root and Jacks I think we're going to see then bowl a lot we might see Mark Wood bowl in short sharp spells but what they'll be looking to do is to break this partnership that has been building you know that once you get this wicket and then you get the wicket of Mohammed Rizwan you really are into their all rounders their tail they've got a long tail just like England have in this test match so for me I think it's pretty evenly poised though it looks like spin will be king we'll find out tomorrow I guess thank you very much England then bowled out for 128 today live ball by ball commentary of the day is already a five sports extra from 440 in the morning all the reaction of course is on the TMS podcast on BBC sounds at the World Cup Brazil are out they lost on penalties to Croatia who will play the winner of Netherlands against Argentina Argentina a one-nil up at half time second half commentary coming up tomorrow it's Morocco against Portugal and then England against France commentary of five live and BBC sounds from seven o'clock and we've been inside the England camp again today our correspondent John Murray caught up with Garis Southgate and he's looking ahead to a huge game Garis I think from the outside this has got an almost an epic feel to it I'm sure that hasn't escaped you on the inside either so how do you deal with that to be honest we're preparing for it like every game we prepare for of course we're one step further in the tournament and we're playing an opponent with increased quality so we can't be naive about how we prepare you've got to make the players aware of specific challenges they'll face in any game and of course this opponent has a couple of individuals that you can quite clearly identify where their strengths are but in terms of the preparation for the game it's been a normal week for us you know the balance of recovery relaxation good focus to training and the meetings and preparing and tapering nicely for tomorrow is the 243 still a consideration or has the way that it's worked with the midfield 3 has that been a little bit of a game changer for you I think what we've always wanted to do with the team is the job is to win football matches and to find the best way of playing with the players that you have in Russia we felt we did that since then we've wanted to be flexible because tactically you can face different opponents that cause you a tactical problem and that's the challenge we've had for every game in this tournament what's the best way with the players that we have to deal with the opponent that we're facing you can have a philosophy but you've got to win football matches and it's no use having a philosophy if you're on the plane home so we've always tried to find that balance that balance has been good so far in this tournament and that's the decision we've got to get right or one of the decisions we've got to get right ahead of tomorrow's game Southgate talking ahead of England's match against France and there will be loads of build up as you would imagine on 5 live sports the stars tomorrow morning Rick Edwards is joined by Emma Saunders to start the build up to that one so tournament favourites Brazil are out of the World Cup they lost 4-2 on penalties to Croatia Marquinhos hit the post with the fourth spot cake for Brazil and this is how that moment went with the Brazilian commentary team the dream of the ex-campeonato goes to Marquinhos he's in the lead Croatia is in the lead with a lot of football to be the final of the World Cup Brazil is out of the competition Let's speak now to Fernando Eduardo a Brazilian football journalist from the BBC's World Service Fernando should this one even have got to penalties should Brazil have got this game done in 90 minutes Brazil should have wrapped it up after Neymar scored the goal right at the dying end of the first half of the extra time Brazil were naive and they paid for it in what way do you think they were naive well 5 minutes ago instead of trying to attack Croatia instead of trying to attack Voguellas Blades they should have held the ball up front they gave Croatia counter attack it was ridiculous Fred the defensive midfielder was on the right wing when the play happened so they paid the price for basically not really controlling the game it's that simple football is played on the pitch and Brazil were naive when you look at the performance of Lovakovic in the Croatia goal he made 11 saves no goalkeepers made more at this tournament can you put some of the inability of Brazil to score a decisive goal down to his good performance yes at normal time he was incredible but after extra time when Neymar scored that amazing goal it was Brazil's game they should have controlled it much better and they did it and they lost fair and square it's an annoying defeat because Croatia were there for the taking let's put it this way so Cicce has stepped down what happens next to this team there are still players who've got many more tournaments left in them you're right there's a lot of youngsters I think the future could be bright but we need a manager now that will pick up the pieces and try to take it for the next World Cup cycle it's not the longest Brazil has spent with our win in the World Cup it's been 24 years before but now they're going to have to rebuild Fernando thank you very much for talking to us Fernando Eduardo, they're the Brazilian football journalists in the BBC's World Service we will bring you lots more on Brazil's surprise exit Croatia's unbelievable win, that's all coming up after 9 o'clock tonight but who will they play in the first semi-final next Tuesday let's find out Argentina leading the Netherlands by a goal to Niel with you for the second half Chris Satterlund and Ian Dennis thanks Kelly, couple of changes to tell you about for the Netherlands Steven Berghus has come on for Bergwein and Kope Miners has replaced De Rond in the midfield so the Netherlands all in orange treading by a goal to Niel now have Noppen in goal still playing with the three central defenders Timber van Dijk and Arke de Vriesen blinches the wing backs Kope Miners, De Jong and Berghus with Gakpo and De Pye As for Argentina who are playing from left to right in their blue and white striped shirts and white shorts Emi Martinez is in goal the back three of Bramero Otamendi, Lassandra Martinez and then Molina and Acunha with the wing backs with McAllister, Fernandez and De Paul in the midfield Messi and Alvarez up front so Van Hal has made a double change at the start of the second half but for a sudden they meet the same formation here's one double Dutch hasn't he Van Hal and Gakpo has just gone up in the central striking role with strikers with Berghus playing and then number 10 role just behind them Kope Miners swatting in the midfield alongside Frankie De Jong Berghus can play either wide or as an attacking midfielder as Messi it's a lovely little take, Messi comes on the inside to Alvarez back with Messi forces the ball out wide Acunha wins the corner in front of the massed ranks of Argentinian support behind that goal he's used to the ball maybe Messi this evening absolutely perfect the ovation is getting now he gives his teammates the ball at the right time just when he's finished with it is it no real hurry to take the corner kick as well on that far side the left a lovely weighted ball for the goal for Molina quite a short one up then for Messi and it goes flicked on at the near post an abstract strike by Blint is going to be retrieved by Sandra Martinez now with Fernandez on this near side level with the penalty area, the Argentinian right up against De Jong takes it all the way down towards the corner flat and despite his best efforts does not get the corner kick he was seeking instead it will be a goal kick that's already been taken very very quickly here from Holland the Netherlands of course the Dutch are looking to level it just like Croatia did against Brazil in our first quarter final we're in the end after extra time Croatia going through to Tuesday's first semi-final on a penalty shootout tomorrow at 3 Morocco, Portugal then England France at 7 you haven't got BBC sounds just yet download it wherever you are on Saturday night you can take us with you with John Murray and Rob Green and Mark Chapman from inside the stadium as Gakpo loses the ball on the edge of the area Dumfries will try and retrieve it Sandra Martinez puts the ball out of play and it will be a Dutch throw that they want to take quickly they're showing much more urgency now as Gakpo in front of a pocket of orange shirts with the cross and it's easily claimed by Emi Martinez the Aston Villa goalkeeper before tonight two clean sheets out of his four appearances Gakpo just standing the ball up, he likes that right hand channel getting to the byline Martinez comfortably gathers Lingworts import from the Dutch point of view didn't see enough of Frankie De Jong in the first half he's the most influential player got to find a way of getting him on the ball and dictating the game like he normally does Birkhouse out to the right hand side for Dumfries looking to go on the outside of a funer but the stocky left wing back will bring the ball away using his strength it's a good effect now here and eventually he says he was being pulled back no and the referee referee's right Junior wasn't strong enough he's furious, he's now lambasting the official on the far side but he just wasn't strong enough I was getting more worried from a Cunha's point of view because he's on a yellow card and I thought with this referee you could take no chances sure if he said you'll get a second yellow card and you're off, he's already missing the semi-final against Croatia if indeed Argentina do go through lovely little touch by Messi McAllister appeared to be impeded Scoloni certainly thought so as well instead he goes out of play and it will be a throw to the Netherlands daily blint towards Cope Miners, back now to Ake they're passing the ball a little quicker now than Dutch a little they have to, don't they? they're going to be in emergency McAllister charges down Cope Miners clearance to Paul with a through Paul, Messi now side the penalty area and he saw that Nopper was sliding off his goal and in the end Messi didn't even go for it if it to Paul should be making that pass Messi had made the run in that right-hand channel just heavy too heavy the pass was and Nopper had to be alert, was alert came out his big sprawling 6 for 8 frame, gathering the ball here is De Jong, midway through the Argentina half you're listening to BBC Radio 5 Live where Argentina are leading by a goal to Nill in this World Cup quarterfinal De Jong forward of the centre circle the pie goes away from him picks up by McAllister he's got Alvarez to his left Vincenzo gets it out towards the right-hand side Molina's return ball from De Paul the move has slowed down considerably now for Argentina although they have retained possession he could have gone out left Alvarez who had made a decent run but the pie gave away the ball and then he gave a piece of his mind screaming at him you've got a show for me, you've got to help me out they're looking for a fifth World Cup semi-final although remember in 78 they progressed to the final via a second round stage so sometimes little stats like that can be misleading as the way that the competition has evolved over the years but certainly the two times winners Argentina looking for a last four date with Croatia if they can manage this second half protect this slender lead that they have Birkhouse is certainly Birkus is certainly going a little bit more through the middle isn't he yeah he's set up it's just the way that has panned out this particular move he's on the ball now Birkus to Gakpo looking to turn and he's going to go on to the pie behind him Blint with a cross it's a poor, poor cross maybe Blint he's been really ineffective hasn't he he's got the marauding Dumfries on the right-hand side but aging maybe Blint doesn't really have the legs anymore 32 the dominating the ball at the moment nine minutes into the second half De Jong starting to see a lot more of it there was an off the ball shot there by De Paul Argentina have got everybody back behind the ball they're being urged on by this passionate crowd wherever you look the Argentinian support inside this two-tier Lucille Stadium the pie is very, very deep inside the centre circle Coat miners is deep in between some of the central defenders on that far side now they attack on the right Dumfries is staying out wide there was Alvarez back on defensive duties to break it up for Argentina and Alvarez with a ball in field Blint with the interception well he's your book messy here but the referee but you don't get yellows if you've got do you well I mean that's similar to the Romero one isn't it the first half the mess he's asking him for a free kick is that pushing it where is the consistency and I'm not giving you that in Spanish either 10 minutes into the second half here on five live Van Dijk Argentina have dropped off nothing's really changed though the Dutch approach centre half's not brave enough to step in when are they going to gamble Australia put Argentina under real pressure and made it quite uncomfortable we wouldn't have necessarily thought that when Argentina were leading by two goals to nail and then all of a sudden we had a rather dramatic finish that was Saturday here we are on this Friday night 1-0 to Argentina so the Dutch at some stage will have to have a concerted effort on the Argentinian back line they are seeing a lot of the ball but by and large they're playing in front of Argentina absolutely right Argentina happy to sit deep they're not really able to get out at this moment in time the Dutch pushing Argentina back De Jong having a bit of an influence now De Jong Berkus holds off the challenge plays it to Cope Miners one or the other substitutes Berkus forward ball to Pie to Gakpo there was De Paul the back pass quickly played away by Lucendr Martínez far side and it's a Kenya to run forward it bounces off the legs of Timber and Alvaro really lucky there good driving run to get himself out of trouble went past Gakpo on the left hand side tried to fire a ball into Alvaro but wayward with the pass Timber just prodded the ball out for throwing to Argentina in no hurry to take the throw on that left hand side now it's a Dutch and they are in a hurry to take it I do you would be if you're treading in a World Cup quarter final Van Dijk runs forward towards the halfway line gained the move breaks down Messi able to turn inside the centre circle over the halfway line shifts the ball out towards his left McAllister passes the ball forward and he's waits Molina again the goal scorer made another good run off the right hand side wasn't spotted Argentina go all the way back Ottenendia cross Nato Romero on the halfway line former West Ham player now the coach of Argentina Lino Sculloni watches in his navy blue track suit looks quite relaxed actually come on he's not done a remarkable job hasn't he bearing in mind that he didn't really have any club or international coaching experience when he was appointed in August of 2018 taking Argentina to the Copper America their first major trophy in 28 years beating Brazil in the American art you can never be relaxed as the Argentinian manager can you with the weight of expectation the ball is hit long and he's got a nice strike towards Dumfries out of play it goes for a throw if you invite him to play cards with you and did he a de chomp don't play poker he's got his poker face down there and he looks very very relaxed we're approaching the hour mark here on five live Chris Sutton is with us ball played forward by Coatman cleared away by Ottenendia lovely little chest off there by Fernandez Messi now has it picking the ball up midway through Argentina away McAllister the return ball then towards De Pauw and then back towards McAllister breaks down it was really on there for Argentina on the counter attack and a better ball from McAllister and De Paul running into the penalty area but it forced him out wide what about the first pass from Messi though took out the Dutch midfield didn't it another reverse pass McAllister missed that pass De Paul would have been one on one just over hit the pass and the chance gone the Dutch have 30 minutes to try and salvage something from this quarterfinal they've progressed from each of their last three quarterfinal ties at a World Cup but they're trailing by a goal to nil Acunha under pressure from Dumfries the Sanjo Martinez plays it forward and Alvarez always a willing runner will lose out to Timber who hooks it down field Cote Miners plays it forward Gakpo looking for the run of Dumfries too many times they've given the ball away Perlis, Eris Drew just not on the same wavelength the Dutch forwards Gakpo on the half turn we'd like to see him drive with the ball there they're playing with this formation with the split strikers but they haven't really linked up at all I think they're playing too far apart then they have to get Perkus on the ball and he's not getting on the ball but here's an opportunity Cote Miners floats it long forward looking for the run of Gakpo Blint now in a central area the left wing back he gives the ball away and now it's with Messi oh another brilliant turn from Lionel Messi brilliant from Messi you know earlier when you said it's a pleasure to be here it's a privilege as DePaul now picks it up towards Messi once again Messi glued to his feet Messi running forward edge of the area goes down gets a free kick because you keep telling yourself this might be the last time that we get to see him in the flesh you just don't know great description the ball glued to his feet I think he's fortunate to get that free kick award the giant figure the Virgil van Dijk looming over him gives him a little nudge Messi goes down this is Messi range certainly is it is left of centre it's 25 yards out they've just been bowing to him in that bottom tier in the end towards our right hand side in the minute he's got his hands on his knees he's getting a well earned rest at 35 years of age but as you say this is Messi range and he's waiting for the ball to be handed to him there will be so many people inside this stadium now with their camera phones hoping to try and catch a glimpse of Messi because we all know what he's capable of why have a camera phone watch the game with your eyes Messi waits left of centre Andreas Nopper won't get much of a view of this behind at least five in the wall it's Messi left footed it was so close it's skin the roof of the net now for a goal kick he knows that was tight it's the free kick left hand side of the box he doesn't go over the ball try and beat Nopper with the biggest gap reverses it onto Nopper side but wasn't far away that was a poor clearance by Otter Mende it was a slip then by Verkus and they've lost the ball Cunha on that far side we've got 50,000 Argentinians who will be looking to extend their stay in Doha until at least next Tuesday might be joined by a few thousand more as well to Paul he's done well bearing in mind there was a fitness doubt coming into the game and then actually staying down he's given the ball away that was the curse of the commentator you can apologise to him after ok it's kind of... Flynn's been told to go down I think he's been really ineffective hasn't he that was Danny as well Danny is the assistant coach down there now they're going to make the change it's going to be an attacking change as well so Daily Blitz has come off he's a 99th appearance and coming on is Lupe Dion for his first appearance at this World Cup the 32 year old striker had that and happy loan experience at Newcastle United about eight years ago he's back with BSV I think Vincent Janssen started the first game of the tournament he did then he came on as a sub against Qatar I mean that suggests that the Dutch may go a bit longer that's his game with Dion Argentina are attacking De Paul left hand side of the penalty area still leading by Golden Hill 65 minutes played here on BBC Radio 5 Live also available on BBC Sounds and all across Africa on the World Service wherever you're listening however you're listening thank you for your company this Friday night and tomorrow Morocco, Portugal and then England, France at 7 Argentina are going to be making another change Paradez is going to be coming off Neanderthal Paradez so he's a midfielder and I would think that might be for De Paul Molina tries to rattle a low one in from the right hand side stopped by Ake so Ake's now gone to left back and they switch to a flat back ball haven't they with Van Dijk and Timbers the two central defenders now that Blint's gone off the field it is going to be De Paul who's going to be coming off so that's going to be a like for like change he has done exceptionally well he has especially early on really nullified thank you to Yong in that first half makes him telling runs going forward like for like swap though tells you everything about how the players themselves feel as if it's a home game here such as the huge numbers of Argentinian support the size inside the stadium because he's able to turn around and apport as if he's a home game in your own little stadium for De Paul as to Yong challenge was made by Alvarez who's been a real tireless running the channels for Argentina we're approaching the midway point to the second half Netherlands 0 Argentina 1 Gacpo has come out on this left hand side for the Netherlands now didn't have any joy centrally right hand channel De Paul playing in that role just off De Yong is the central striker Dumfries playing high up now on that right hand side unable to get on the end of that was Colt Minas Dumfries staying very high on that far side they've got to go for it nothing to lose now halfway through the second half haven't later Glove in Argentina the iron tulip has made number of changes now the Dutch they need to start showing their minerals see what he did there van Dijk out towards De Yong running forward on the right hand side accelerates De Yong looking for the cut back towards De Pij cleared away by Fernandez there was a foul there Messi on Ake was that the referee says no he got the ball Messi chases after it puts a challenge on Timber and in fact the referee has brought it back for the earlier foul I think it's a bit strange the referee taking it back there centrally you think here is Ake he could have given the free kick from the wide area there back with De Yong Argentina have everybody back behind the ball we have just over 20 minutes remaining De Yong just outside the centre circle Garedes was tracking it De Yong Messi trying to stay tight towards it Coat-minus turn rolls it out towards this near side the volume increased by the Argentinian support once again Gatpo's little drag ball down the left hand side didn't quite come off and it's a throw that Ake wants to take quickly there's a way they can hurt Argentina the Dutch quick switches a play get overloads those wide areas the cross from the right headed away by Fernandez lifted back by Ake and that was a foul off the ball and it was Coat-minus and there's going to be a free kick to Argentina on Romero shake it ahead from Coat-minus Romero rolling wriggling around on the grass not too much in there but there are a wily old outfit aren't they Argentina just need to see this game through Alvarez don't ever so well Acunha joins the attack goes on ahead of him Alvarez waits back inside to Alexis McAllister to Romero stabs it forward Gatpo kept him play actually on this near side by Molina rapid right back is Molina took his goal ever so well 10 minutes before half time and that's still the difference between the two Fernandez Molina a willing run up is going to go on another run and Molina almost round the back Acay at left back sliding getting up to sit into the path of Van Dyke Acay did really well just to clean up off the Berners on then this is McAllister running forward partially cleared away kickback up by Acunha runs on the left hand side Acunha goes down is that inside the penalty it is Acunha was brought down and the referee points to the penalty spot and Argentina leading by a goal to Niel have a chance to increase their lead on the left hand side Acunha the ball is fed to him and he shapes across the ball and chops back inside Dumfries does catch him I think he's quite theatrical Acunha but there was sufficient contact it was a foul no messy pops the ball on the spot Bart will be checking of course yes of his 94 goals that he has scored for Argentina they are all time top scorer 26 of them have come from the spot little little lead he's a giant isn't he not bird a giant in the Dutch goal at 6 foot 8 the diminutive figure little messy incredible to think that his goal against Australia was his first in the knockout stages of a world cup with 18 minutes remaining this penalty for Argentina and for little messy will surely take them into the last four messy waits patiently messy runs up now and scores the keeper didn't even move left-footed messy takes the claim of the Argentinian support his dream is still alive the Argentinian dream is still alive and surely now they're separate day with Croatia in the semi-finals because they lead the Netherlands by two goals to nil and of course messy is the man who delivers no surprise coolest man in the stadium just strolled up to the ball he watches all the way and the big Dutch goalkeeper just stands up messy whips it across him to Nopperts left-hand side half way up just has a look doesn't he just has a look doesn't he just has a look doesn't he like a stroll in the park finds the side netting I think it's game over now the Dutch have got it all to do but on the big occasion the little fella well he just keeps rocking up doesn't he he's got a great great takes him level with Gabriel Bacistuta the 10 goals in the world cup and in Martinez here we had to angrily to Luke De Jong and all of a sudden the referee has got a sort out the squabbles and the shoving and the pushing inside that penalty area is blowing his whistle five times he'll be taking it all in oh and an Argentinian is that an Argentinian fan well somebody's run on it's hard to tell he's actually been manhandled by four security guards if he's wearing shorts he's got some accreditation there so whether that was an Argentinian fan I think it must be because if it was someone off the bench there's definitely accreditation I mean he's hardly got any clothes left on mind you I think he's taking five or six of them that's the equivalent of Mr Mussel down there there's about six of them the stewards are all in black he's been dragged away the reason is he's wearing shorts by the time they tackle them very very quickly and our eyes have been transfixed on that I've forgotten what had happened with the players it was all happening there for a minute he's being hauled out across from the Dutch right hand side Martinez came and gathered plenty of hide on the cross and I think Lutte Jong just left a little bit on him and then it all kicked off De Pye getting involved the Dutch showing some fight but is it too late De Pye and every Martinez booked gap points is the penalty area what's the contact there the Netherlands are looking for a penalty Gakpo went get down might have been a soft one I'd like to see that again was there contact Cody Gakpo or contact on the ball Valtvec horse is going to be coming on I think the Dutch 88,235 is the official attendance Valtvec horse is going to be coming on I think they're just going to go route 1 here to Netherlands try and follow what Australia did to try and make it an uncomfortable last what 13 minutes of normal time meanwhile Argentina are going to be making a couple of changes as well Talia Fico the left back will be one of them so he's going to come on for Acuña so that's like for like Acuña will miss of course the semi-final through suspension and then it will be Jameen Passella who will also be coming on who's an essential defender so I think this is Scoloni reacting and getting another body at the back is it Romero coming off Romero's Acuña's gone off the far side Romero coming off here so straight swap Passella into the back line and the Dutch are going ugly De Pye is the one who comes off Valtvec horse comes on the ex-Bernley man now playing his pride Istanbul for Bessik Tash and you're right it was Romero who had gone off for Passella well this is going to be Huffball from the Dutch now isn't it two huge strikers you think it's just going to be direct brutal knock down football runners off Beckhorst and De Jong critics of Louis van Haal will say tonight even hasn't been pretty before they start to do that ugly side of the game that Chris Sutton is referring to trailing by two goals to nil ball played in headed on by Beckhorst towards De Jong and then hooked away by McAllister they are giants aren't they Beckhorst De Jong Stature 3 Arjun Tinnian centre halves remember as well that Beckhorst is already on a yellow card having been booked in the first half speaking out of turn when he was on the on the bench so he's got to be careful and straight away he's in the thick of it and Martinis who has also booked catches the ball as it's just tossed to him and in fact there's been a owner we gave it with that yellow card they're just only now saying that Martinis has been it was Sandra Martinis not Emmy Martinis I've lost well I've lost count of everything header four with by van Dijk flick header by Beckhorst and then eventually hammered away by Osamendi to Messi nice ball played forward by Fernandez to McAllister Alvarez he's out wide Alvarez into the penalty area Alvarez with a cut back sat up in the air and caught by the goalkeeper Nopper I just wondered whether Alvarez could have got a shot off quicker decided to drive on the outside of Dumfries crossed the ball Dumfries got a boot on it Nopper gathered gratefully they've gone 4-2 for the Dutch Gakpo is playing wide left Burghus has gone wide right and then Beckhorst and De Jong in the middle that was a thunderous challenge but the referee is actually saying he's given the free kick as Argentina are going to be making another change the radius wasn't up with the challenge we're sitting not far away from Martin Keone who calls that type of challenge a reducer listen to the ovation note for Julian Alvarez the Manchester City player the Argentinian supporters tonight realise and can appreciate how hard he has worked as he's replaced by Artaro Martinez he was first picking the first game against Senegal up alongside so Alvarez now the preferred choice Gakpo with the curling free kick headed away by Fernandez they only need one though to Dutch don't they to cause a bit of panic yeah they do Australia did they were serenely progressing until Australia in fact that late save by Hermione Martinez they've all stayed forward there Van Dyke, Akke Cross comes in from the right headed out by Ottenendig Marshall's defence and walks that line of white and sky blue shirts to push on out towards the right, Berkers and it comes and they've got a goal Veghorst off the bench Vald Veghorst the former Burnley man with seven minutes remaining and their gamble has paid off, they've reduced the areas cross from the right, heads it past Demi Martinez and it sets up a dramatic finale what a header this is from Veghorst, the ball whipped in from the right hand side and the left footed they can't play through them the Dutch so they'll just go direct, crosses into the box, got the big guys on and this is going to be a nervy last seven minutes plus whatever for Argentina Messi at the moment is down and he's just turned over onto his back and he's not sure what happened there from the kickoff, it was played back towards Messi and then there was a late challenge and it was from Veghorst, he stands on Veghorst he's on a yellow card remember Veghorst is huge left foot on Lionel's foot must be ten sizes difference yeah giant isn't he Veghorst forget total football Route 1 Van Halway Incredible though, isn't it, that it's panning out exactly the same way as it did against Australia because two little up against Australia and there were really some anxious moments for Argentina and they're going to have to maybe go through similar nerve-shredding moments here with six minutes remaining the fact that the Dutch, of all of a sudden crossed from the right header, reduced the areas absolutely and there's been a lot made as a result of the Dutch style in this World Cup competition and they are playing the most basic form of football but it's about being effective and they're back in this Jack Poe with the cross from the left-hand side the young weights down with header oh what a hit that was what it was in for a moment it was Burgos who just struck it left-footed and it was travelling like a bullet into the side of the net the little Argentinians cannot cope with this aerial onslaught from the Dutch terrific knockdown from Veghorst I thought it was in as well somehow it's a corner, what happened corner kick on that far side the Argentinian supporters are trying to do their bit but the Netherlands with another corner from the right-hand side are going to make it a rather uncomfortable last five minutes but they're trying to see them over the line but the way the Argentinian are just dropping back they're inviting the pressure from the Netherlands they're trying to get up the Argentinian backline Van Dijkers stay forward three huge guys up top Veghorst a giant, Van Dijk a giant De Jong a giant they're not the biggest the Argentinian sender halfs are they he said before that it was 4-2-4 it's now 3-2-5 Van Dijk's up there as well here comes another long ball De Jong with a flick on towards Veghorst before tonight the former Burnley striker had only played 19 minutes of his three appearances at this World Cup but his goal has given a Dutch hope with four minutes remaining five live and BBC sounds live here in Lusail Argentina leading by two goals to one Coat minus that two Dutch Reef now with Timber Van Dijk has returned to his more natural position Ake Gatpo can't take it on the outside of Molina they don't want to drop do they the Argentinian backline every opportunity they're trying to squeeze a yard or two a long searching diagonal ball headed away by Ottermending Van Dijk leaves it for De Jong he's given them all away to Ottero Martinez running forward fresh legs from a substitute Messi goes down gets the free kick oh that was a sliding challenge from Paradez on Ake Messi has stayed down gets the free kick and Verkhoos has just been shown a yellow car I think that must be for descent I've lost track of the yellow car from the referee I've lost track of most things in all honesty Messi took a heavy touch there the worst touches the evening Argentina may be slightly fortunate to be awarded the free kick you just want to try and play in the Dutch half we have two minutes of normal time remaining the additional time will be fascinating as Ake oh that was a poor poor challenge it's all going off it's all going off mayhem absolute bedlam down below it was a poor challenge in the first place and then think it was Paradez he smashed the ball into the Dutch substitutes and it all kicks off what's the more off what is he thinking of what does he expect Paradez just lost it well everybody's involved down there the most portions in the game actually was in Nuremberg I remember I was at the game Portugal Holland and there were 16 on that occasion it included four sendings off what are we up to now hold on I'll tell you in a minute I mean the entire Dutch bench quite rightly were Paradez is shown yellow and he's still not finished well I mean the challenge was a terrible one on Ake late lunging but then it was the way that he just kicked the ball into the Dutch substitutes Van Dijk runs into Paradez doesn't he chest on chest Paradez goes down and then all hell broke loose we're up to eight eight yellow cards last 30 seconds remaining Berghaus sends it in on the stretch done free to the far side goes out of play what's the referee signaling here he's got another one out showing it to the yellow card who was that to he just he in the direction of probably ten players and a couple of benches I mean is he saying number I don't know anyway it's chaos by my watch the 90 minutes to run ten minutes about it on time we're into ten additional minutes they're not happy the Argentinian fans the fun can continue for another ten minutes another bombardment they go long on the stretch that's onto it to Berghaus the referee gives a free kick to the Netherlands just outside the D I've got a feel for the fourth official as well because every time a decision goes every man off the Netherlands benches up and asking for a decision to go in their favour they just haven't been able to cope it was Van Dijk by the way I mean it could have been to anybody you just threw it in the air you're better to say possibly who hasn't been booked this is a a great opportunity what 22 23 yards out just on the arc of the the D it's 2-1 to Argentina to the second minute of ten to be added on it's a free kick to the Netherlands it's fractured left ascent just outside the D Gatpo is there I think it's suit suit to right foot up right foot up over the wall left hand side of the box away from the goalkeeper well Berghaus is looking really interested so I know he's a left footer Argentina have got everybody back I think it's McAllister who's in the the draft excluded position lying down behind the wall Berghaus into the wall it goes and the cheers from the Argentinian supporters will tell you that that ball did its job very very well by the way the nine yellow cars doesn't include one of the coaching staff from Argentina head injury there has been after a stoppage in play it was a long throw and Ottenmendi and Lisandro Martinez both ran into each other the referee is pointing to his watch it's a nasty one Ottenmendi Martinez is backpedaling Ottenmendi going forward in collision just seeing that Berghaus effort which went narrowly wide I think we both thought it was in the knockdown from Veghors I know at times tonight we've had a little bit of wrestling whether it's a pitch invader being taken to the ground and the warring players that were as well but actually on five live tomorrow night on Sports Extra we do actually have live boxing for you Josh Warrington defending his IBF featherweight title live in Leeds but our five live team are here in Qatar, Le Seyre tomorrow England France but we will know one half of the semifinal line up in about seven minutes time but we can't say for any great deal of certainty that it will be Croatia against Argentina because the Dutch are going down with the fight as they trail by two goals to one and six minutes remain Bandai at the back Timber Argentina want to be brave with that back line, that back five they want to stay high the Dutch trying to push them back Argentina cannot cope with this barrage long balls knocked down football Veghors gets it out towards Gakpo on the near side the left level of the penalty area quickly closed out and it will not be an Argentina throw despite the best efforts of Leandro Paredes instead it's the opposite number five Nathan Ake to pick it up Veghors making himself available the seconds ticking away for the Dutch we're about to be half way through the minimum and additional ten minutes here on BBC Radio 5 Live here is Timber outside the centre circle in the Argentina half out towards Burgos forward then it goes on the right Timber's diagonal ball drops just outside the D they've all stayed up from the back so many orange shirts to aim for Gakpo kills in the cross an Argentinian player goes down off the ball and the referee blows his whistle and it's a free kick and hold on Paredes and Burgos are just having a little word there and now on some ending turns to the Argentinian supporters behind the goal to our left where there's just a small pocket of orange and he tries to whip up the Argentinian supporters and they respond they're going up in the air again with their arms the balloons are bouncing they're jumping an Argentina a minute away from going through there's a terrific defensive header Luc Dion just lurking behind him ready to head the ball in to the net with Otamendi but his head to it headed it away they're hanging on in there the Dutch have increased the pressure the Argentinian supporters have increased the noise four minutes remain of stoppage time two-one to Argentina headed forward by Paredes out of play it goes through throw you still feel that the Dutch will create one more opportunity in these next four minutes headed forward by Paredes over the head of Paredes picked up on that far side by Artara Martinez back it goes then towards Andreas Nopper the goalkeeper giant frame of a man Begg horse lays it off Cope Miners goes long headed forward by Dion and it's the header off target and Emi Martinez doesn't bother about picking up the ball the Aston Villa goalkeeper starts waving to the Argentinian supporters as well they really took to him during the Copper America and the penalty shoot out it was a bit of trash talking and the Argentinian fans really warned to him it's actually really difficult to pick out the formation the Dutch are playing this moment in time they're playing with five forwards including Van Dijk who went and retrieved the ball from behind the Argentinian goal two and a half minutes remaining Chris Sutton with us here on BBC Radio 5 Live out towards Dumfries hits it long searching diagonal ball over the head of Van Dijk picks up by Berkhoes on the right hand side for the Dutch he hits it back behind Dumfries and Argentina have a break up and it's with Paredes he goes down on the half way line and he gets the free kick and he's on his knees and he does the clinch celebration because every decision that goes their way they know yeah that's a really soft free kick driving down the left hand side turns back in trying to hang on to the ball minimal contact no rush from the Argentinians every time there's a break in play an Argentinian player is gesturing to the fans what would Roy Keen make of this we'll find out what Chris Sutton makes of it because Kelly will be asking you all sorts of questions I hope she's been making notes I can't remember what's happened because we have 90 seconds remaining of additional time the sky blue and the white scarves are being swirled around their heads an estimated 50,000 Argentinian supporters in this bastadium this is it isn't it for the Dutch they go along with a free kick Kootenmaier has dropped on the edge of the area Van Dijk's cushion header Ake tries to lead it into the path of Gatpo cleared away by Molina watch for entering the last 60 seconds of additional time Argentina lead by 2 goals to 1 De Jong won a cross into the penalty area partially stopped by Paradas he goes down and break it stupid, stupid challenge free kick to the Dutch great range this Paradas again isn't it little messy pleads with the referee it's a foul Beckhorst in an Argentinian sandwich there on the edge of the box last chance for the Dutch their football has been brutal hasn't it but maybe maybe from a set piece we will see another yellow card Messi's been booked that hasn't gone down well at all you can't book him you can't book Messi Messi's just been shown yellow it's his first of the tournament imagine if he would have then been ruled out at the semi-final that however is not the case however will they be in the semi-final because by my watch the 10 minutes of additional time are over this is it now if the Dutch can score off this free kick then an additional 10 will have an additional 30 Gatpo or Coatminus Coatminus rolls it in low the Dutch they have done it the Dutch in added on time have broke the hearts of the Argentinians it was a lovely ball that was played in low and it was just guided in Vout Veghorst has squared it and we are going into extra time what an impact the Veghorst has had double Dutch from Veghorst that's all right and we talk about how brutal the Dutch have been and they have just played Huffball but a bit of craft from the free kick you normally see players go for glory from this range but it's Berghuis and he just rolls the ball 10 yards along the floor to the giant Veghorst first touch with his right foot and he swivels and with his enormous left foot it's a toe poke past Martinez into the corner Dutch craft from the free kick from two down they're level Ottenbende has been shown a yellow card that takes the tally to 11 now if you include the official the goal was timed in the 101st minute from Vout Veghorst it was a minimum added on of 10 the Argentinian players were complaining to the referee and by my watch now that is it and that pocket of Dutch support Messi foul carried on De Jong tries to barge him off the ball rolls it now towards the near side towards Molina the Argentinians are shell-shocked and the referee now blows his whistle and the bench down below and they are complaining towards the Spanish referee words are being said the Dutch players are off their bench as well this isn't good we've got a fight there between one of the reserve goalkeepers it's kicking off again objects are being thrown from the crowd there are plastic bottles being thrown from the Argentinian support behind their dugout and not for the first time this match has descended into Mayhem and Chaos I mean there's both benches on the field a lot of bad feeling it must all be down to how long the referee played it was 10 minutes wasn't it initially Ian the referee the Argentinian substitutes surrounding the referee saying come on how why where did the extra time come from well Kelly we've got another 30 minutes of this and do you know what I'm absolutely delighted this game has had absolutely everything Argentina 2-0 up Molina and Messi on the scoresheet Messi with the assist for the first goal both bed costs of Burnley formerly of Burnley with both goals for the Netherlands they brought them level after 90 minutes we've had rumbles on the pitch we've had rumbles in the dugout there was even a pitch invader but I think what was written on his chest was the name of a self-styled prankster so I don't know if he was using that attention for anything more worthwhile than just self-promotion however this game has had it all what it hasn't had yet is ascending off but given how many yellow cards they've already been that might be on the cards over the next 30 minutes as well so Chris, Saty and Ian Dennis are here inside the stadium we're also joined by Tim Vickrey and Mario Melchiot Mario what a way to send this one to extra time for the Netherlands I can't believe this you know Kelly look you prepped for the game and I thought like I'll be honest to you when I was watching the game I thought towards the end I was like it's over but then the way they came back it's exactly the same thing we do for years we have the long balls in the game that's plan B coming from the side and the free kick the way he took the free kick you know called minus they have practiced that because that is not the free kick you normally see he pass them the ball he gets on the turn and he puts it in oh my god I'm telling you Kelly I'm still shocked and still raving such a clever free kick Tim Argentina though are not just shell shot they are furious well yeah they look like people who have just been mugged wandering around in a daze the least experienced coach against the most experienced coach and for most of the game the least experienced coach wins doesn't he they turn Dumfries into a liability in the end with the way that he gave away the penalty but then Holland come roaring back first it's kind of route one long balls everyone up front and then the subtlety of that wonderful free kick it's going to be disputed I don't think Argentina are happy at all about the decision but there it is it's in the back of the net you've got to go and win it all over again we've got another 30 minutes to look forward to and we are looking forward to them very much the players are lined up on the pitch they are almost ready to go Ian Dennis is keeping his BDI on any possible substitutions or maybe he's just looking for another rumble because that's the way he rolls whether you've got the first period of extra time first start in any in Dennis thanks Kelly I was just working out actually before tonight Veghorst three appearances 19 minutes he scored two in 18 minutes to take us into extra time for what has been an extremely dramatic night and now all of a sudden as Tim quite rightly says we've got just a different game now because what do the Ducks do now do the Dutch continue to play Route 1 knowing that they can unsettle Argentina yeah or to the why change I mean we've heard a lot about the Dutch style of play throughout this World Cup and the Dutch people back home not happy with the brand of football and you can imagine I can imagine Amsterdam de Jong on Veghorst on the Moans and the Growns but it's worked hasn't it just being direct it's brutal football you know you think about the Dutch influence on football and you know let's play the Dutch way I mean this is as ugly as it can get but it's Louis van der Holt coming into the World Cup said we are going to be effective back three and for attack they can't change why change you know earlier on when we said about the Spanish referee just showing a yellow card to just put it in the air the monitor and the screen here said it was van Dijk that had been booked but then they since changed it but van Dijk during that end of period has now been shown a yellow card so the the yellow card count now I think stands at 12 as we're underway I know what you said I think have you seen my notes by the way the first period of extra time you're listening to BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC sounds and it was a penalty shootout in Sao Paulo eight years ago we still have the possibility of another shootout as these two sides meet for what is their sixth World Cup meeting and I would think that the Argentinian supporters inside this Lucille Stadium will be emotionally drained they've given it everything the way that they've cheered and danced and bellowed and then to have the agony of a 101st minute equaliser they'll be absolutely shot but Argentina in their blue and white striked shirts playing from right to left as we look against the Netherlands all in orange Argentina in possession and now out to this near side for Cassandra Martinez, Talia Fico forward, McAllister so we've got Emi Martinez, we've got Molina Hermaine Pesella Nicolás Otamendi Cassandra Martinez and Talia Fico in the field of Fernandez and Paredes, Messi and Artarón Martinez for Argentina for the Dutch who are now playing a flatback for, Nopper is in goal it's Timber as the right back sorry, Dumfries is the right back Timber and Van Dijk in the centre Ake at left back you've then got Frankie Dion and Cube Minas with Gatpo Burghus and Begg Horst and Luke Dion and just incredible drama incredible drama oh it isn't now I think Argentina just trying to make some passes try and get a foothold back in this game the players I think pretty much shell shocked with the Dutch equaliser you think all throughout extra time every free kick which was awarded every time the ball went out of play the Argentinian players the crowd up it took a leaf after the men from down under went up and under and it paid off for them Australia came close but Begg Horst I wonder if there was somebody in Lancashire tonight a Burnley supporter thinking he never did that for us I've got to say I thought the free kick was beautifully worked but the award of the free kick was the right decision I think some of the Argentinian players simply were over aggressive weren't they in the last 10-15 minutes Paredes on the ball now being one of them Paredes plays it in low Fernandez able to turn Lattaro Martinez was ahead of him instead he opts to give it right towards Messi Messi kills over the cross tell you Fico he's off his chest it's need forward and then the header back by De Jong was superb because there was a certain figure wouldn't say he was looming not to sure that he can loom Messi in terms of the size difference between the two but he was just thinking of an acrobatic effort was little Messi yes he was he was loitering wasn't he Messi as the ball Martinez is right there he just helps the ball on and thank you De Jong as you like coolest head in the stadium it's it back to Nopper I'll be surprised if we if we don't see red in this game tonight won't you yeah absolutely I'll be surprised if we didn't see another two three four guards in this extra time just it's gonna be interesting fascinated will the Dutch change the way that they play what worked was getting crosses in the box wasn't it being direct wasn't that the question I posed for you at the start in comes the cross from Gakpo I mean Martinez dropping back to his goal line safely watched it over onto the roof of the net now for a goal kick to two you got Gakpo off that left hand side for the Dutch creating a little angle on his right foot whipping a ball out of play too high too wide and Berghuis off the left sorry off the right hand side a left foot there to get the ball on that left foot produced the cross for the Dutch first goal brilliant ball in super finished from Begghorst this is live on BBC one as well so just a reminder for any game live on the BBC you do have the option of listening to the Firefly commentary whilst watching Tomorrow Morocco Portugal at three England France at seven I had my Martin Keown when it was all kicking off he wasn't getting overly excited but he was used to that sort of thing as a player wasn't he yeah he would have reveled in some of the shenanigans should we say he loved a bit of violence Martin for six minutes into the first period of extra time this is BBC Radio Firefly the pace has dropped we're just starting to return to normal after the dramatic circumstances of the 90 minutes well 101 minutes as it was when our Spanish referee Antonio Maciu decided to give that free kick it is like the Argentinian players are in a bit of a daze absolutely shell shots like they're trying to work things out tentatively play themselves back into this game it's come back to being quite a cautious game of football now as McAllister this is Paredes rolls it out towards that far side the right and then they go back to Emi Martinez building from the back looking to come forward now here with Fernandez he was fouled, stopped free kick just outside the centre circle to Argentina 2-2 they found new levels of energy they've taken the old throat lozenges and they're back at it again the Argentinian supporters what I would say is that if Argentina do go home tonight this World Cup is going to lose a set of supporters that have created the atmosphere here in Qatar absolutely I think the neutral would like Argentina to stay in the competition Messi shuffles the ball short Fernandez plays it out towards Molina comes in off that right hand side Argentina are attacking right to left back towards Messi sliding challenge taken away by Ake Berg who plays it forward Luftiong makes the run right hand side Luong needs some support comes in the shape of Berg who's inside now towards Luong to Luftiong and there is a foul on Luftiong and this means that the Netherlands have a free kick and once again they will be a threat at this set piece with their aerial threat absolutely waited pass from Frankie Diong into Luong Diong Diong gathering the ball in on the half turn drawing the free kick so what happened of the last free kick and they worked something special clever with this one Berg who's to take it left foot in, clipped in headed out by Lissandra Martinez played back forward and there's a foul there was a collision and it was that was fouled by Dumfries it will be a free kick to Argentina about Berghorst at Burnley in the Premier League 1457 minutes two goals about Berghorst against Argentina tonight 22 minutes two goals not that that would make anybody who supports Burnley feel any better so Tony Livese if you're listening Dumfries with the back pass actually since he's gone to Besiktas he scored six goals in 14 appearances for the Turkish side as there's a little bit of off the ball it was nothing, oh that was something sinister though because all of a sudden that was Timber it was involved and the referee has blown his whistle despite Argentina attacking now Timber is on a yellow car and Messi was the one who went to ground and the referee has given a free kick VAL will be having a look at it yeah it's uh Messi turns to make a run and it's an accidental collision I think just really cute with his movement Messi shapes out like he's shapes out like he's moving towards the ball turns and runs into to Timber Timber fails Messi you can hear what the Argentinian fans think of it that decision not to award a yellow card four and a half minutes of this first period of extra time live on five live to go Messi to take a free kick not quite midway through the Netherlands half left footed doesn't be the first man headed out by Timber but the Dutch had everybody back every orange shirt was in and around their own penalty area there back towards Messi goes long again and over the head of Arcade and it's that support that cheered up because it'll be a goal kick and we have the chance to get another breather a little bit surprised at that Messi whipping the ball in from the free kick and Argentina trying to to work something try and play down the side of the Dutch defence looks like they've just run out of ideas Argentina we have Son and Frolix on five live this Friday night and we could still have a penalty shootout as well in 2014 it was Argentina in that semi-final in Sao Paulo that went through four to the Dutch have a dreadful record when it comes to penalties they've won only two of seven shootouts at major tournaments cleared away mind you they've got Noffer at six for eight for the Messi penalty did he put Argentina to the look and at that stage you really did think that they were set for that date with Croatia Paulo on the callister by Dumfries free kick to Argentina on the half way line you still sense this could really bubble over an extra time so 2014 was Tim Kruel came on the previous round another free kick to Argentina and then he didn't hold Tim Kruel off he wanted to take a quick free kick sorry I thought they were going to do what I would say is that Alexander Arnold would take a quick one but the referee had blown his whistle and he wanted it on the whistle Tim has got to be careful because this is persistent fouling Tim Valens another yellow of course he's seeing red it's a free kick to Argentina it's a central position we have under two minutes of this first period of extra time Messi left-footed clips it on the stretch unable just to get on the end was Otten Mendy he threw himself at it with a trailing right leg and out of play it goes for a goal kick not far away Otten Mendy you normally see Tim's trying to create more of an angle but from a fairly central position just slightly right hand side of centre Messi left-footed curls the ball over the Dutch backline Otten Mendy at full stretch wouldn't quite get that big right boot to it still two-two a little bit of hesitation eventually the ball is picked up by Emi Martinez all in red away towards our right hand side the Tim Kruel Heroics was against Costa Rica in the quarter-final they actually came here with a very inexperienced set of goalkeepers really because before this tournament Nopper was on caps and you had Passfield with two caps and the other one play out with only six Nopper now at 28 years of age keeper of Helen Vane looking to establish himself as the number one after forcing out Silicen the Dutch turn through to Yong all in orange playing from left to right and the first period of extra time is now over it's still Netherlands two Argentina two Chris Yeah I mean that first period of extra time with the drama we had during the 90 minutes was a pretty tepid affair I've got to say I'm a little bit surprised in that the Dutch who finished the game so strongly blood and thunder balls into the box didn't really trouble Argentina but Argentina seemed to have maybe just lost the nerve really create anything of note Will one of these well who's going to be bravest in the second half of extra time or are they already thinking both teams about penalties Kelly Mario Melchiot is also with us Mario do they look to you like the Netherlands are already thinking of penalties Yeah definitely I think this game is going to come through that moment because you know if it stays like this of course and you know what the key things what I'm worried about is like what the guys already mentioned I don't want any of us to get another card because for example Timber he's looking really dangerous I don't want anything to happen because if this game gets to penalties hopefully we practice enough so we can get it going because normally what Argentina has is that when the battle goes on it's a normality for them they know how to battle and that is sometimes we as Dutchies don't always know how to do it but now I think they're holding firm and they're doing well so let's see if they can pull this one out Mario it's been really good talking to you thank you very much for joining us this evening what a game to be part of for us so thank you Thank you So thank you very much to Mario Melchiot Ian Deniz and Chris Sutton are going to be taking you through this second period of extra time You do wonder a bit Chris why Holland with all the momentum from that late late equalizer didn't maybe ride that energy for a little while Yeah absolutely it was working for them you know it was brutal they were effective they got themselves back into the game playing group 1 football but they got level and now they they're just a little bit fearful in that first half of extra time I don't think any of the players really wanted to go to penalties but that's the way they both played in that first period of extra time I'd like to see them be braver gamble and try and win it in this second period They're looking for fresh legs for Argentina Yes they are as the second half of extra time is back underway BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds Gonzalo Montiel has come on to replace Melina who gave Argentina the lead like for like places for football as a right back for Sevilla Messi right to the challenge tries to get Montiel forward Argentina trying to get it into the middle for La Tierra Martinez for the referee who played the advantage, gives a free kick to Argentina for that initial challenge on Messi and it's 2-2 but they've taken the free kick too quickly and the bench are up in arms again they've had that decision for the referee now he blows his whistle it's taken short Messi to Montiel, slips and then actually, Gacpo runs it behind for a corner kick it was actually a dreadful pass from Messi that's a pot of all 15 yards into Montiel but too close to Gacpo Montiel slipped Gacpo inadvertently poked it behind for a corner to Argentina Messi with the corner and eventually caught by the Dutch keeper Nopper came into it, he initially lost it but whilst he was still falling he gathered it safely into the puzzle of his chest and now he clears away left footed downfield away by Ottenbend out towards the Sandra Martinez he will run out towards that left hand side, tries to chip it forward do the Dutch at one stage knowing how they unsettled Argentina when they were 2-0 down to dramatically get it to 2-2 is there a period in this next 14 minutes or so where they do the same or do they hold on to what they've got and think they'll take it to penalties knowing that they've got a dreadful record in Schuethaus that's the risk I don't get that one who knows what's going to happen with the penalties but if the Dutch end up losing on penalties they'll be saying well why didn't we play extra time like we did the last 13 minutes of normal time since losing the 1930 final to Uruguay each of Argentina's last nine eliminations from a World Cup have come against European nations, we thought they were going through I think they thought they were going through a lot of the supporters around us certainly did at 2-0 but it's now 2-2 just a third minute of extra time here in Luscia they're all over Messi aren't they, every time they know that he's the magic man who can make things happen for Argentina he's just hanging out on this right-hand side you can see Frankie de Jong his eyes all the time on him we've already seen the back of Neymar today a little bit of hesitation from Nopper he thought the ball would bounce into the penalty area and in the end he had to concede a throw up to safety first Al Cristiano Ronaldo fair tomorrow Morocco, Portugal live on 5-5 from 3 could this be Messi's final ever appearance at a World Cup as he's just been brought to ground and it's a free kick in a good position for Argentina just in from the right touch-line probably about 25 yards out somebody's spoken out a turn again down there and that was Gonzalo Montiel who's been showing yellow card and that now means that he is suspended he will miss the semi-final that's just foolish, just he sent so Montiel is showing yellow card he like a cunier will be suspended now should they go on to play Croatia he's only been on the field for a matter of minutes free kick Paredes touches it to Messi, runs forward right corner of the area onto his left foot, Messi no curl and it was always on the rise goal kick 2-2 they played it short out on the right hand side and Messi driving in to the box on his left foot Paredes on his right hand side waiting for the ball Messi to be popped out to him Messi decides to go inside on that wonderful left foot of his but high and wide with the effort so when Portugal played the Netherlands in Nuremberg in 2006 it was 9 yellow cards for Portugal and 7 for Holland most portions in a game 16 the card count is 5 to the Netherlands and 7 to Argentina 5 minutes played in this second period of extra time and the way that this Spanish referee is going we could easily have a few more he loves it doesn't he did say, did or not he did, yeah he's Di Maria coming on can't be, can't be fully fit, can he can he can he can he against Van Hal can he, very critical of Van Hal Argentina on the attack moved brakes down picked up Montarro-Mití Martínez cleared away by Van Dijk inside the penalty area imagine if Di Maria was to have one final say with Louis Van Hal but didn't play in the last game and it is going to be Lisandro Martínez a current Manchester United player zero of irreplace by a former Manchester United player Di Maria is on the Netherlands being wild are attacking, gap boat challenge comes in from Pasello, he's shown yellow her name Pasello is shown a yellow card Pasello is shown a yellow card Pasello is shown a yellow card I thought it was a good challenge on gap boat, maybe he got gap boat for a long way back here before the ball that must be Guinness he does catch him he does bring him down, it is the correct decision just seeing it on the monitor again, it is a yellow card must be Guinness for the records, the yellow cards we're halfway through the second period of extra time I don't think they have included the one for the coaching staff of Argentina in the first half what is that? anyway, it's 2-2 danger danger gap boat with the free kick Luc D'Yong has two bites at that and eventually it is cleared away the referee blows his whistle beautifully worked wasn't at the free kick D'Yong all the way around the back as the ball floated the far post left foot fully choked a little bit into the floor so Fernandez gets the block on it D'Yong follows through to either foul gap post just come off and the player has come on Bec Horst of course has already made his impact they're now looking for another striker to do exactly that and it's Noah Lang who plays for Bruges who has come on for the Dutch so Noah Lang is just on he might see him in the Premier League in the not too distant future because there has been a lot of interest shown from Leeds United in the 23 year old once again a little bit of pushing there goes on D'Yong Frankie D'Yong on the little mess he is watching him like a hawk 2-2 here on 5-Line ball play through Loctano Martinez looking towards Montiel the clearance isn't properly away by the Netherlands De Maria picks it up Fernandez comes forward by Hansaid all that took a wicked defection what a blow that was Loctano Martinez with a right footed shot it looked goal bound and it calmed away and it's gone behind for a corner kick and it was off the chest of Van Dijk yes it was brilliant from Fernandez little jink down that right hand side works himself a yard fizzes the ball across Martinez hammers the ball into the mid-drift Van Dijk behind for a corner they're not wanting to take the corner kick they wanted a VAR check it has been taken in towards the near post Coop miners with the first one into the air and then volled away by Van Dijk 5 minutes remain otherwise we're going to have a penalty shootout another one for this second World Cup corner final Montiel will win a corner kick getting forward at every opportunity from right back they're jumping up and down behind that goal there's urgency now for Argentina Roll short right corner of the area Nessie, Fernandez shoots actually Fletcher loops over the crossbar and for a corner kick he goes that could have gone anywhere it was off Beckhorst I think and the keeper was already going to ground it was agonising absolutely spot on Noppert has gone down Nessie just feeds the ball to Fernandez let's the ball run across his body left footed Hammer's a shot takes the deflection into the floor Noppert had gone but agonising me over the bar for Argentina Argentina now looking for another their turn to try and get a knockout blow after they bounce pocket back off the canvas from that late Dutch goal that forces into extra time because now the Dutch are being forced back cross comes in from the left behind for another corner kick the defenders have all stayed forward 4 minutes remain far side the left it's an out swinger and the header from the defender which was Pacella was over the top and it's a goal kick to the Dutch and another minute he's been a tick by Christian yes poor defending from Virgil van Dijk Pacella makes a run towards the near post loses van Dijk left footed out swinger can't get the header on target Noppert that penalty shootout that we were talking about earlier for the Dutch against Costa Rica was their only win in three attempts in a shootout at the World Cup for Argentina they've been involved in a record 5 World Cup shootouts they've won 4 England fans need no reminding of 98 and they could be set for another one here on 5 live the ball is won by Timber forward ball towards Lutley on trying to get back hoarsed away through the middle picked up cross comes in and it was no a land with a cross from the left and it was Burpus who was making the run through the middle but that was assured handling by Emi Martinez I'm going to slightly disagree with you about assured handling he dropped it it was a good decision to come and try and claim it but a bit lucky there maybe your definition of assured is different to most people I've had a nightmare I've felt frazzled 2 minutes remain turned by Messi runs forward runs out towards the left hand side Talia Fico is there they play the ball back 2-2 Talia Fico every Argentinian player now is in the Dutch half away towards our right hand side and 2 minutes remain Montiel inside Fernandez Messi has come short to De Maria wouldn't really settle for him but he's gone well to keep the ball Messi loses it in the midfield Ferreira tries to win it back break on for the Netherlands out to go, Burkowski goes Lutti on and Begg Horsten with him Burkowski goes in alone he crosses and that was assured handling by Emi Martinez now he rolls it out under arm trading blow for blow here on 5-5 the history between the two long history in the world cup and it's going to continue 2-2 Lutti Martinez beaten out by the goalkeeper sharp turn outside the D hit it through left footed great save from Noppert really clever play from Lutti Martinez, look like he's going to pop the ball off to Messi, use Messi as a decoy swivelled left footed shot Noppert down to his right hand side 60 seconds remain of a dish, well extra time second period of extra time how much added on time will there be Messi picks it up midway through the Netherlands half plays a short ball towards De Maria looking for the return, Ake there with the interception Van Dijk tries to usher out the orange shirts De Maria picks it up, central position cleared away by D'Amphrice falling back now it's with Paredes to Messi Messi shoots left footed took an inflection it's a corner kick corner kick to Argentina we have 30 seconds remaining yes Argentina have been in the ascendancy in this second period of extra time Messi just works himself a yard gets a shot off left footed but this is it isn't it for Argentina De Maria to take it on the right hand side it's an in swinger it's a goal and it needed Nopper to make the save on his goal line not so sure that's a a shot on goaler he meant it De Maria but that big Dutch hand of Nopper getting it away corner taken short comes out oh whatever that was fired in by Fernandez he turned away he thought it was a certain winner right footed to the left hand post Fernandez right hand side of the box he must be 22 yards out I mean you just wonder that clattering off the post Nopper nowhere near it all sorts of movement on the ball whether this is going to be Argentina's night or not Clarence downfield one minute of additional time the Dutch one last chance forward ball breaks down runs through to Emmy Martinez rolls it out and the referee blows his whistle and if you thought the last I'm going to say two hours but it was two hours and 11 minutes have been nerve wracking and filled with tension and drama we've got a penalty shoot out now to prepare here in Lusail two to it's finished Ian Dennis and Chris Sutton bringing you all the action and all the drama from the Lusail stadium where the atmosphere feels like an elastic band that is getting pulled tighter and tighter and any second the penalties are going to come and it is going to snap Tim Vickery our South American football expert is with us Tim there were chances for Argentina at the end they came so close to wrapping that up inside the 120 minutes but there's going to penalties it's a scandal really isn't it but it's one of the lessons that we've seen from this World Cup pattern of the game Schmatton you can win it in little hang in there in little bursts how did Japan beat Spain and Germany little bursts five minutes here ten minutes there and Holland have done it saving themselves with a kind of 15 minute burst against Argentina didn't do a great deal else for the rest of this marathon encounter but they did enough in that little burst to be hanging in there and taking this game to penalties Do you think that the Netherlands approach this thinking penalties are our best way of progressing to the next round even if it was just something at the back of the heads I don't think so from the start but remember how they beat the states and how important the right wing back Dumfries was for that performance and Argentina changed their formation and they came up with a system that neutralised him and they ended up making him do what he doesn't want to do so much which is defend and he gave away a rather soft penalty but then Argentina went 2-0 up and you thought then that it was all over once the Dutch had hauled their way back into the game you sent there an extra time that they knew that they may perhaps just get something on the break but from that point the main task was hanging on for the penalty shootout which of course they lost in the semi-final against Argentina 8 years ago maybe they'll have a little bit better luck this time that wonderful free kick goal though from the Dutch it does remind you of the one that Argentina worked against England in 98 do you remember that goal Kelly free kick on the edge of the area a cute one to the edge of the wall and Zanetti bangs it in on the turn the Holland one was similarly cute and even more important because it was then or never that game went to penalties Argentina came through that one let's see what happens now Tim Vickery for now thank you very much both sets of players now making their way over to the centre circle Argentina have been ready to go for quite a while Netherlands just been huddled up a bit longer with their substitutes with their manager Louis van Haal they're in the centre circle the captains are tossing the coin to make sure that they know which end they're going to go which end they're going to take the penalties at and which side is going to go first it doesn't really matter for Argentina which side they take the penalties at their supporters are well represented all the way around this stadium but there is a little pocket and maybe at most a couple of hundred to the right of the goal over to our left so presumably that's where they would prefer to go and it looks like that's where Virgil van Dijk is taking the ball to take the first penalty of this shootout for a place in the semi-finals of this World Cup it's Netherlands against Argentina 2-2 after 120 minutes for Sutton and Ian Dennis thank you Kelly well earlier today when Brazil went out on penalties that was the first time in eight World Cup shootouts at the side that went second actually lost and now it's van Dijk up against Emi Martinez who saved three penalties against Colombia in the Copa America semi-final we're looking away towards our left hand side van Dijk short run up against Emi Martinez all in red van Dijk to the Netherlands saved by Martinez he's done it again more heroics and the Juts have not made a very good start gotta say this is a magnificent save two steps van Dijk gets good pace on the ball whips it across Martinez you can say it's a good hide but flies and blinks himself to his right hand side Franky De Jong sang the goalkeeper's gone early there the Argentinian players now ushering De Jong back I think he my gut instinct there was he's said again he may have gone early there good to see that again Messi now steps forward to get it himself on the board he's fluctuating fortunes from the spot so far at this World Cup oh how cool is that oh how cool is that he just rolled it left footed not put a dime to his left and then he stood there you've referred to him as like God he just took it in arms out wide that was brilliant it was the penalty he scored in real time whipped across Nopper goes to his left flings himself to his left Messi sits him down rolls it in it's one one in the shoot sorry it's one 0 to Argentina in the shoot this is Steven Berkus the former Watford player left footed goes for power Martinez makes the save and Martinez away to his left and the Netherlands have had their opening two penalties saved by the goalie keeper what a save and Martinez celebrate just listen to the noise Berkus left footed longer run up powers the ball across Martinez once again he's full stretch big left hand keeps the ball out Leandro Perez the substitute comes on waiting you're listening to 5-LIVE we're also available on the BBC Sounds app Paredes now the 6 foot 8 goalkeeper waits Paredes scores an infasiq penalty and Argentina are two to look in the shootout live on 5-LIVE yes perfect from Paredes real conviction in that strike real meaning in that strike power whips it across not bad what a position Argentina are in this is Koot Miners who's come forward now to take it Van Dijk and Berkus have already had their effort saved he has to score they really are under pressure we mentioned that dreadful record they've won only two of seven shootouts of major tournaments it's a left footer Emi Martinez waits Koot Miners scores and that silence is the crowd he had to score they've taken three they've only got one on the board it's Argentina who leads 2-1 Koot Miners keeping his cool Martinez playing mind games with him going for a face off before he took that penalty but he whips it left footed to Martinez as left Montiel now comes forward Gonzalo Montiel of Sevilla who remember like Acunha will miss the semifinal should Argentina go through through suspension long run up to the edge of the area Montiel now runs up oh what a well good penalty placed it perfect keeper goes the wrong way they've scored three out of three and now the Netherlands have to score magnificent Montiel Moppert guesses the wrong way Montiel just opens his foot up slides it to Moppert's left hand side Valvec Horst his two goals took us into extra time he's got to score otherwise the Dutch are going out Veg Horst waits Emi Martinez on his goal line Gances from side to side Veg Horst does score Martinez went to his left Veg Horst right footed finds the bottom left hand corner and the Dutch are still clinging on trying to grab the ball off Martinez Veg Horst really exceptional penalty as they're coming together now between Dumfriesen Dmeria but he wrapped his foot around that Veg Horst's shape to go to Martinez his left hand side and wrapped his foot around it to the right sends him the wrong way this will win it for Argentina ends open under they're currently leading three to it would be the same score line in the penalty shootout in that semi final in Sao Paulo if Enzo Fernandez who hit the post right at the end can score here for Argentina they're on the verge Enzo Fernandez starts to move to his left runs up now it's a stuttering run up Enzo Fernandez has missed Enzo Fernandez has missed and it is still advantage Argentina three to I don't think I could take much more of this just misses the target the young man Nopper stands big flings himself to his right hand side that's a horrible miss Fernandez Luke De Jong Luke De Jong so experienced pass to score for the Netherlands Luke De Jong just scored and Martínez moved to his left and De Jong rolled it in the other way and that's their third penalty that they've scored out of their five and now all of us are, oh look at this Lattaro Martínez steps forward and he's faced by four Dutch players who break away from the centre circle to try and put him under some pressure with the verbals and the card has been shown of course it has to the big balls from Luke De Jong there sits Martínez down but the pressure on this penalty Ian I don't think I can watch and now you've got a little bit of gamesmanship here from Andreas Nopper who's come up his goal line and had a word there with Lattaro Martínez seven goals in qualifying if he scores this Argentina withdrew Lattaro Martínez just scored the keeper went to his left Argentina celebrate the dreadful record for the Dutch continues and Argentina just like in 2014 triumph on penalties and they will play Croatia in Tuesday's semi-finals but the bad blood continues between the two nations oh as it all is kicking off once again down below from those Dutch players and now we've got a fight and once again the referee and his assistants and the coaching staff have got to try and sort out the squabbles for those who are either not shell-shocked and have dropped to their knees in orange in the centre-circle or those who have formed a huddle in the blue and white and what has been a fratious night on Five Live but it's Argentina and expect the exodus from Argentina to continue there's 50,000 now there could be a few more on their way what a night Kelly and for those tens of thousands of Argentina fans who have made this world cup every single game that Argentina have played in such a joy to be a part of you have to feel delighted for them they're waving their shirts above their heads in the crowd it is a sea of sky blue and white as they celebrate with the Dutch players devastated on the pitch in front of us Argentina still in a huddle still gathered around them each other the whole bench the whole backroom staff are out on the pitch they're all embracing and Chris Sutton we will try and analyse this at some stage but some games are just all about the emotion there isn't any real sensible explanation as to what we've just seen over 120 plus whatever minutes and the penalties it was just mental it was bonkers the game was how the Dutch got back into it with a brutal brand of football and effective brand of football then it goes into the extra time and the Dutch have got themselves back into the game by being really direct stop being direct and possibly played for penalties I can't believe they were actually thinking that playing the extra time but they actually stopped playing that way I didn't understand that then Argentina hit the post in the last seconds Fernandez with a ferocious strike is it going to be their night or is it going to be another South American side out of the competition after Brazil but I mean the penalties Argentina were up and then it looked like the Dutch had gotten themselves back in it but Lossero Martínez is penalty the last one what what nerves of steel what composure when the pressure was really on I'm delighted Argentina are through for their fans I mean I absolutely am they have in many ways made this world cup they've brought so much to this world cup I feel for the Dutch but I've got to say I just wonder whether there will be that sense from back in the Netherlands why didn't we continue with that same plan in extra time that's exactly the question I'm going to ask in one second but I just wanted to ask you about the penalty shoot up because when Brazil went out earlier today Neymar was up to take the fifth penalty this time around for Argentina little Messi takes the first and he scores Neymar didn't even get to take his is that something that Argentina were able to build on throughout their penalty shootout you're looking at me like I'm talking nonsense what's the weather Chris no no I'm looking at you I'm really trying to work this one out I think that the justification is on penalties it doesn't matter no matter what order you go in as long as you as long as you win I mean Messi's penalty was beautiful the way that he actually sat Nopper down because you know in the game he went to cross Nopper but he's shaped up to go the same way but I mean he's he's super clever but other than Fernandez all the Argentinian penalties we've seen some really rubbish penalties in this competition haven't we but a lot of conviction one from Lionel Messi in the earlier rounds yeah by the way what you're talking about Neymar that's happened before with Cristiano Ronaldo at a tournament he waited to try and get the the glory moment didn't get chance to take the penalty and so the last time that Portugal were involved in a shootout he thought I tell you what I'm going to take the first time this one so is that not the biggest pressure penalty the fifth one you know so I mean there's that it's an interesting debate isn't it it is but we know we know why they're doing the last one they want they want the the glory moment don't they maybe it's that there's more for the biggest moment and maybe it's that there's more pressure on the last one and so the highest level player is better able there are lots of reasons elsewhere but look we are going to get the Netherlands perspective on this in a second but the Argentina players have got their arms around each other they are bouncing leaping towards the Argentina fans who are over behind the goal to our right there are tens of thousands of them every single one it looks like has got their shirt over their head including the players they're swinging around they are dancing to the goal music that is what's been picked by the Argentina squad to be played every single match every time a goal is scored and every time the final whistle goes all in this case the winning penalty is scored they are celebrating they're absolutely harnessed all that emotion that those Argentina fans are able to bring and they are fantastic scenes as there are every time Argentina play in this tournament but for the Netherlands the other end of the pitch they're in a circle they are in a huddle Louis van Halen is in there with them they are just taking some time out quietly to reflect on what happened Marcel van der Kren can you put anything logical on what just happened well it was a cracking match actually the match we were waiting for and we knew they needed to raise that game but how long did we have to wait for it you know it was too long in the game and it was like Christus said it was a bonkers game at the end it was a miraculous sort of escape was it going to work that was all it was like a lottery but again you know we saw that what we've said all through this tournament and what I've said it's not enough you can't go in the world with such defensive football you need to attack the minute we played Dutch football big strike rope, wingers, gagpou on one side burgers on the right wow it was happening it was happening but this is what we wanted to see all through the tournament this is what van Halen should have done you know because we can't play like Italians Katzenaarche but then when you've done that then they stop doing it in extra time well and this is why Louis van Halen wanted to steal the show with his system he claimed that he wanted to improve the world that the gamers what did he say he valued it it's changed and you can't play like we used to anymore wow rubbish I keep it neat well he'd get the blame for this Marcel what is this on Louis van Halen's head absolutely I mean well he couldn't have told the players I don't believe in extra time he couldn't have told the players to stop playing in that way they didn't the last 15 minutes that's got to be on the players I can't for the life of me work out why he would do that stop doing what was been effective right well what I couldn't believe is that the energy level of the Dutch it first it went up of course they get adrenaline boost at the end of the game and then in the final part of that extra time we see that Argentina had more energy and I expected that Argentina would have you know it would was one and a half years ago I checked I think that he played under 20 minutes you think that that team hasn't got the energy but they did and I
