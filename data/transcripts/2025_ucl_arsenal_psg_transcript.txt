 CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Just slightly disorganised that, because the players were gathered together by the referee while Arsenal's players were still in their huddle and were unaware of what was happening, so that was the reason that that was a little elongated and there were a couple of referees' whistles. That a man of justice and peace is what was written on the black-and-white photograph on the big screens of Pope Francis. So we're ready to go. Both teams, both managers yesterday talking about making history. I think that's what makes this semi-final all the more interesting and intriguing the fact it's between these two clubs, Arsenal and Paris-Angeman, who have never won the famous trophy with the big handles. The referee blows his whistle and the first leg of this semi-final begins with PSG kicking off and the ball hit long-downfield by the team, and out of play for a throw-in to Arsenal. So neither club has won this trophy. One of them will be in Munich next month for the final, and there will be great disappointment for the other. Throw-in to Arsenal, up towards Bukajor, Saka, pivotal figure in that victory over the record winners, the holders, Real Madrid and the quarter-finals. Saka again, still inside his own half, tries to thread it forward. Fabian Ruiz wins it back from Saka. Here is Dempéle, the dangerous PSG number 10, a chorus of booze for Dempéle. Remember, he didn't play here in October when Arsenal won 2-0 in the league phase of the competition after a breach of discipline. Luis Enrique left him out that night. Arsenal won by two goals to Niel. And then Bukajor-Saka just gets a touch on that against Nuno Mendes and the ball runs out of play near the halfway line. I don't think you can underestimate how big a call that was from Luis Enrique. That might either, because that sent a message to his group of players, hasn't it? The discipline, what he expects, you can be the star player, you can be the big player, but if you don't work hard for each other or you're not quite filling in in where you need to be in his mind, you won't play. And I think that there's no coincidence this PSG team has just grown since that moment, and now they're a pretty efficient, hard-working team that get about the pitch and try and make life difficult. Let's see how Arsenal cope without the season. Arsenal pressing them while PSG have possession, and Hikimi is forced to play the ball long downfield, and that just gives possession back to Arsenal, and Miles Lewis-Skelly knocks it across for Raya, who passes it out through the middle, and Merino was put under pressure. His pass was a little short out there to the far side, and the challenge came in, and that has resulted in a free kick to PSG for the challenge on Hikimi, ten yards inside the Arsenal half. So PSG take it short, back into the centre-circle. Beautiful night after what's been a beautiful day in London. The sun has shone, it's been warm, and it is dry here tonight, and the PSG supporters with a massive banner, which reads, Ultra has been stayed in position right at the front of their section. Many of them are bare-chested in there as well, familiar area for the away fans at the Emirates Stadium. Vettiniya, the former Wolves midfielder, who has really grown in this Luis Enrique team. Here he is with a curly black hair. He's quite a short midfield. Chvau Neves and Vettiniya, Fabian Ruiz, the Spanish-European championship winner, is the tallest of the three of them. Ball out towards the right-hand side, and PSG now enjoying a feel of the ball. This is no problem for Arsenal in that sense. They're quite happy for PSG to have the ball in and here. Martyn Odegaard leading the press for Arsenal. Dembele has dropped deep and he's received it in the centre-circle, and Dembele is off on a run through the middle. He gives it out to Cavarra-Tecalier on the left-hand side. Cavarra-Tecalier against Timber, stabs it back to the edge of the air. Dembele with a shot, it's in! Through a crowd of players, enough opposed! PSG have an early lead! And it's their danger man, the big danger man, the top scorer, Dembele with his 33rd of the season, who has struck Arsenal-Neal, Paris-Anchorman won, less than four minutes played at the Emirates. Wow, it's the purpose and the speed of Cavarra-Tecalier. That was just absolutely blistering, I have to say. They play through the lines really well, PSG into midfield, it goes wide, and the distance that Timber has, he just can't make it up. And the speed that Cavarra-Tecalier gets on the ball, and his first touch is just to drive into the box, he's so aggressive with his decision-making, he draws the midfield plays towards him, and Dembele's just pulled out on the edge, he flicks the ball to the outside of his right boot, and it's bouncing towards him, it's actually a really well-controlled effort with his left foot, right on the 18-yard box line, and he just bounces the ball towards that far post, strikes it into the ground, and it bubbles in off the post, and in the back of the net, what a start for PSG. Super goal, Lewis Enrique couldn't have asked for anything more there. I'm sure that there's a lot of that in that move, in that goal, that he has preached to them. Dembele dropping deep, so deep into his own half, to receive possession in the centre-circle, Arsenal didn't deal with him, there were nowhere near him, he was able to take the ball on through the middle, then the man that was signed in January, the dangerous Georgian, Kavaric-Kalia on the left-hand side, running at Kimber, and then Dembele finding a position, edge of the area, bang, 1-0. He was powerful, wasn't he? Kavaric-Kalia, the way he went at it, I mean, the speed, his touch, it was just... It was medicine, wouldn't it? It had a real feel of purpose, and the little off-load, the flick with the outside of his right boot to the edge of the box, and like you said, Dembele just pulled in there, pulled the trigger first time, and it's on target, it's actually a tough ball to score from, but it does so well to hit the target, it's a cracking start from the Paris team. Well, Dembele, as I say, 33 goals now this season, 8 in the Champions League, he'd not scored in his last five appearances, he's kept one for the big occasion tonight, and PSG 1-0 up early on. It's not going to be Real Madrid all over again, is it? Clearly not, but Arsenal has plenty of time left in this tie, and they have to just gather themselves together. I mean, it's given PSG a massive boost, and I was saying that Arsenal won't be too disappointed at the ball. Long throw to the near post, flicked on by Martyn Alley, the big Don Miro-Romo is there to catch it now. Yeah, they're not too bothered if they don't have the ball, because they're set up so well defensively, but PSG did play through them really nicely there with a couple of passes, and that's something that will just maybe keep Arsenal on the back foot a little bit. Handball given against Timber, who dispossessed Nuno Mendes, but the assistant quickening flag, with a free kick to PSG in their own left-back position. So this is BBC Radio 5 Live, the atmosphere already punctured by that early goal for PSG in the fourth minute. So Paris Saint-Germain, who did reach the final, if you remember, Thomas Tuchel's Paris Saint-Germain, their only Champions League final, the Covid season, when they lost to Bayern Munich, when the Parisian Kingsley Coleman scored the goal against them, against Thomas Tuchel's side. But they are, as we've said, over the course of the second half of this season, this is the best side of Paris Saint-Germain that we've seen, as they go all the way back to Don Miro-Romo on the edge of his area. Yeah, I'm just looking at Arsenal's midfield as well. I think Marino is actually playing really deep, and Ryerson and Oda Garda getting higher up the pitch. If anything, Marino is the deepest midfield player in Arsenal's trio. Quite the early setback for Miquel Arterto and his team, but as Matt Upson rightly says, there's a long, long way to go. Fabian Ruiz, second leg is next Wednesday, so week tomorrow. You'll hear that with us on 5 Live. We'll be live in the park de France. But right now, PSG with the edge, and here's Hikimi. Do it, do it at the edge of the area. Brilliant little run from him. Such quick footwork there. Found a bit of space on the edge of the penalty area, but it was blocked away. Comes out now as the ball is lifted over the top, but all the way through by Dembele. For Ryert to catch the ball as it bounced up in front of his body. Saliba playing the ball across the back, and Rice on the edge of the area. And then Saliba again, playing it back into the box to Ryert, who very carefully passes it out to Declan Rice. And then Arsenal begin to move forward, Timbac. The Arsenal right back with the PSG left back putting pressure on him, so Arsenal have to play around him, but they do. Rice, man of the match in both legs against Real Madrid to Marino. Now here's Martinelli into the match for the first time. Martinelli beats his man, goes for the byline, and then there's a deflection there, which takes it behind Grasnor's first corner. Yeah, it's exactly what Arsenal want. They're delighted with a set piece of corner. Martinelli, you just feel whenever he squares up Hakimi on that far side, he's just going to want to go for the outside of him. And even if he doesn't get the cross into the box, Hakimi's going to block it out for a corner. Arsenal can get set up, and this is something that PSG they must have worked on, John, because it's such a key weapon that Arsenal have, but it hasn't been as strengthened there this season, PSG. So it's a corner. I see someone's got a laser. You can see the laser pen, can't you? That green light is darting around, trying to put PSG off. So, you know, could do without that, obviously. So it's a corner. Declan Rice to take it from the left-hand side. Arsenal so potent as, I'm sure you know, with set pieces. Rice is a deep one there, and it's headed across goal by Marino, and then PSG get it away, and Hakimi on the chase. Trossard with a challenge. Hakimi goes down, and referee Vincic is straight across with the yellow card for Trossard. He tried with his body language there, Trossard, to suggest there was nothing in that, but the referee's seen that as a foul that broke up the PSG counterattack. Free kick, Paris Saint-Germain, yellow card, Trossard. Yeah, I mean, Hakimi's got a bit of pace, isn't he? Wow, he really put the burners on Trossard, running back to the halfway line, and I'm just looking at the replay. There probably is enough contact from Trossard. You're running at that speed, you can't put your arms all over a player, and he goes down, you're going to pick up a yellow card, and I think the referee probably is justified to dish that one out. That reminds me as well, Matt, to mention that all of the yellow cards, players who were on yellow cards and inverted commas, they were all wiped after the quarter-finals. So, part is suspended for this, but all yellow cards wiped. So, it's a clean slate to begin the semi-finals. Dembele now out to the right-hand side. Here is Douay, Douay with that blonde highlights, shoots low, but Raya's able to go down to his left. I think it might even have been going wide anyway, but he misshated, and it was a comfortable one for Raya to go down to his left. Sharp start, John, isn't it, from Paris, I have to say. Again. Again, I mean, we're talking about they're not in sparkly form of, you know, the last four or five games that they have started this game, the supreme purpose confidence. They look really, really sharp. The team that knocked out Aston Bella, the team that knocked out Liverpool, the team that hammered Manchester City in the park, the friends and the league. Here's Vettiniar as Arsenal have lost possession. Vettiniar flicking a pass out towards the far side. Douay just has to backtrack the 19-year-old and then pull a pass to William Pattshaw, the impressive Ecuadorian central defender, another of the youngsters. 23 years old with the experienced captain, Marquinhos, the Brazilian captain, to his right, here's Nuno Mendes, whose stock seemed to have absolutely soared this season. Remember how the two fullbacks scored the first two goals at Vila Park in the second leg? Hakimi with the early opening goal there, and Nuno Mendes scored in both legs against Aston Bella. And that third goal in the first leg proved to be so crucial. Here he is again, the Portuguese, the number 25. Passing it forward to Cabaret's Kehlia, who is challenged by Timber, who tried to get his leg around Cabaret's Kehlia, and he took the ball away, which he did, but he caught the scarves of the Georgian as well. And it's a free kick to PSG. Yes, a fair old calf to catch as well, isn't it? He's pretty strong, Cabaret's Kehlia, and he just plants himself really well. Long pass over to the right-hand side, Douay gets it down, he's into the box now, plays it back to Hakimi, who goes full 360 degrees as Arsenal force PSG back to the halfway line. Makiños now out again to the Kehlia, and then PSG begin the build-up again from the halfway line. So, Paris-Angeman with the early goal, he just joined us on five-live. Here is Cabaret's Kehlia, who's set it up for Dembele. Cabaret's Kehlia, Arsenal have got two men on him, Saka is back with Timber, still going, Cabaret's Kehlia trying to work a corner, which he does off the shins of Timber, and a corner to PSG from the left. I mean, Saka's dropping all the way back in to double up with Timber in those 1v1s, and then with Cabaret's Kehlia, he's a tough customer. They know he can go either way, it's so tricky for Timber. You don't know whether he wants to go on the outside or the inside, and he's just as devastating with either foot. So, it is a corner for the fishers, just talking to Mikhail Artheta, because the set-piece coach, of course, Jovair, is in the coaching area as well. So, there's a bit of discussion going on there. Douay gets it back, crosses in towards the back post, which is headed down, then stab back, Hakimi with a shot across the penalty area, that's blocked in there, Shroudnevez there, back to Hakimi again, all dangerous looking, Ball, which is headed by Marquinhos, but close enough to Raya to make quick ground to his right and catch it. Yeah, it's a nice delivery in, and Marquinhos, who had stayed up from the set play, was just floating around in the middle of the box, and it came onto his head, he got a glancing header onto the ball, and it's another chance for PSG, really, I mean, safely into the hands of Raya, but another warning shot. This already feels edgy to me. It does, yeah. It's had that start, it's been such a confident, controlling start from PSG, it really has. Arsenal win a free kick on the half-way line, and Trossard tries to get one of the PSG players' boot, there are a couple of them there, tried to take it quickly, it's hit into, well, Trossard is saying here, I've already got a yellow card, what about that? Luis Enrique has just come off his Arsenal dugout seat to have a word about that as well, and all that happens is, referee says, just a free kick on the half-way line, so set piece, and actually, Ben Belly has just thrown the ball back to Raya, suggesting that Arsenal are going to take this from the wrong place, so the goalkeeper's going to take this, he's going to strike this long downfield, Arsenal nil Paris Saint-Germain won, tomorrow night, Barcelona against Inter, so we'll have news of that on Five Lives Sport, Raya with this long, long free kick that is over the top of Merino, won't reach that, and it skips off the surface, all of the advertising hoardings, and into probably about 150 photographers who are behind that goal, behind the PSG goal, they are there to see Arsenal goals. We've not had a sniff of one yet, there's a few here, aren't there? I mean, it was busy getting to the stadium earlier, a lot of attention on this game, but David Raya, I mean, that is taking it to the extreme, I know Arsenal want to set plays in the box, but I mean, he's just come all the way up to the half-way line to launch that free kick into the box, they really are trying to test that PSG back for. So no clean sheet for Arsenal tonight, as Audegarde plays it over the top, this is for Martín Alicace, Hakimi, he's able to pull it up and away. I'm not sure he's going to get too much change out, Hakimi on the run inside of things tonight, he looks pretty fit and quick, Hakimi, I think Martín Alicace is going to have to liven up his game. Yes, he's one of the best as well, isn't he? Latiniya makes a run forward down the right-hand side, now Fabian Ruiz, here is Kavaric Calia, getting the ball down, running at Timber again, into the penalty area, three Arsenal men are there, he's found a way through, he's gone down, oh, was that contact there? Referee says no penalty, Kavaric Calia gets up and runs towards the referee, he's turned his back on him, and Kavaric Calia now palms apart to the fourth official, and clearly here, this is a bid to get VAR to look at this, which of course they'll be doing anyway. Well, I mean, it's either a foul or for me, a dive, I mean, there's no kind of in between, I mean, he's running away, remonstrating with the referee, arms in the air, really adamant that it's a penalty, when there were three players he had to go through, I couldn't really see if there was contact or not. I think the question there is, did he initiate the contact? How did he actually flick his legs against the Arsenal defender, all vice versa? It looked like that, because he was trying to squeeze for a gap that just wasn't there, there were three Arsenal defenders. That's a foul for Kavaric Calia. Halfway inside his own half, this one, Timber has gone in there, and that was, it was quite a heavy challenge there, and the PSG captain, Markinios, has gone to the referee, also Fabian Ruiz, one of the most experienced players in this team, they're both making the point, and let's just see, this could be a big moment here, if he decides to show a yellow card to Timber for this, that is the Arsenal right back, and Kavaric Calia already looks as though he's in the mood to have a good night, and it's not a yellow card. No, he's got away with that Timber. I mean, he's kind of decided enough's enough, and he's gone through the back of him, really late on the halfway line, there's just no need for it. I mean, just having to look at the replay of the penalty shot, there was a left arm of Timber that comes out, stretched around the waist of Kavaric Calia, and I have to say, he's through all three of those defenders, he's managed to worm his way all the way through, I can see why he's got up and ran after the referee, I mean, that was an interesting call, that one. He did throw himself down, and there was not contact on his legs, no, but it was the arm around his middle. Correct, and I think, was it enough? I think that they must have arrived at the decision, BAR, to say the contact's there, but it's not enough to send him to the ground, so we'll stay away, it's not a clear and obvious error, but you feel if the referee had given it, I don't think they'd overturn it, no. It would have been a penalty. There was something there. But it's the right decision not to overturn it and give a penalty. Correct, I agree with that. Arsenal, nil, Paris Saint-Germain won, they're living on the edge Arsenal, already in this tie, even though we're still in the first 20 minutes of it, there's Fabian Ruiz with a ball on the halfway line. There is one match in League One tonight, by the way, Burton, nil, Wigan, nil, and Solihull, Muir's nil, Rochdale, nil in the National League, both 745 kick-ups. Tomorrow night, as I say, we'll keep you up to date with Barcelona, Inter. Tomorrow night, commentary on Manchester United, Chelsea, in the Women's Super League, and then do not miss Thursday night as well. Two commentaries from the Europa League for you on the Manchester United and Tottenham semi-finals, Manchester United on five-line, and Tottenham on sports extract. And PSG winning a free kick in their own defensive third and playing it back to goalkeeper Donnarumma. Yes, Ian Dennis, who is with you in Madrid, he's off to build bowel this week. He does see the world, doesn't he? He gets a ball, he does. As Clarec Kaliar is challenged by, Timber goes down, this is five yards inside the PSG hop, this time it's Audegard, the Arsenal captain who goes across to the referee with his hands in praying mode, and the referee's going to have a further word with the two captains here, probably to say to them in the old-fashioned style, I'll do the refereeing around here. Yeah, I mean, I don't think Timber does too much wrong, if I'm honest, he's just got to be careful not to have too much of a nibble with this character, because he's getting his body in the way, Clarec Kaliar, that it makes it impossible for Timber to win the ball, and he's the type of fullback that likes to go after it, he'll stick at it, he'll have a nibble, he'll keep going, he'll want to throw it away, he'll want to prod the ball away, and you're running the risk of picking up a yellow card, very early on in this game, he's got to be careful. Well, next one, he'll be booked. Yeah, he will, for sure, it doesn't matter what the tackle is, all the offence, you feel like a yellow card is coming. However, Arsenal do have Ben White available, after they both missed the Crystal Palace game, White and Marino last week, and actually the prognosis after that match didn't look too good for either of them for this first leg, but White is available as a substitute right back on the bench. Declan Rice, lovely ball down the right, from Rice, for the captain, Odegaard, Arsenal, Red and White shirts coming forward, here's Saka, not being able to get into the game yet, excellent, beats two men, then the challenge, comes out to Marino, that was tough for Odegaard, brilliant control, volley set across, Marquinhos is able to head it out towards the edge of the penalty area, Duaier got a touch there, and then it was whacked away, but the whistle had gone, free kick, Paris Saint-Germain. Oh, I'm not so sure what the foul was for, I mean, it looked to me like Martin, he just bumped Marquinhos and made no attempt to head the ball, and just bumped in midair and stopped him getting a clean header on it, I think the ball is going back to Donorama's box there, and that's the right call for me, I think no attempt to play the ball from Martin Ely, and he made the foul, and then there was a collision with Duaier and Marino, there was a lot going on, but PSG have started this game very well, not only with the ball, but any little skirmishes or loose balls, or having to run and shut down and scrap, like we know this team is good at, they've been right on it in that front as well. Well, the three tiers of the Emirates stadium are absolutely wrapped by this first leg, of this UEFA Champions League semi-final, Paris Saint-Germain, getting the early goal, Arsenal now trying to work their way back into the tight, there's Marino who scored the third goal here against Real Madrid, the other goal, if you like, gives it to Saka on the right-hand side, Saka now hopes, raised, of Arsenal fans, back to Timber, then back to Saka again against Nunomender, right footed across towards the back post, Marquinhos jumps, deflected to Martinelli, Martinelli very tight, he pulls it across, that's clear to win, it comes out for Douay, to pass it forward to Hakimi, and suddenly PSG are off, Genbele is furthest forward, but Hakimi is just possessed by Miles Lewis-Skelly, who is then fouled by the PSG right back, and that's a free kick to Arsenal, and Miles Lewis-Skelly raises the roof. Yeah, I mean, referee had to keep his call there, because there was a big cry for a yellow card, Hakimi, just went across the back of Lewis-Skelly as he dispossessed him brilliantly, and I think Lewis-Skelly in fairness, he plays for that foul completely, and Hakimi is just running back, and Lewis-Skelly steps right across his path, yes, he draws the contact, but the referee is right to keep his yellow card in his pocket, because it was engaged by Lewis-Skelly really, and I mean, there's just great match-ups going on all over the pitch, the physicality and speed of this game is really special. So no yellow card there either, just the one shown so far to Leandro Trossar, but the referee, he could have been tempted to show at least one or two more, but it's a free kick to Arsenal. Arsenal FC with this free kick to be taken by Odegaard, so the big man are up, Kiviar is there, who scored with his head against Crystal Palace at this end, the end to our right, last week waiting and waiting for Odegaard, little steps, here's the free kick, left-footed, Kiviar's head up, but it's straight at Donnaroma from maybe 12 yards out, and the big Italian goalkeeper can just hold it and gather it into his chest. Yeah, I mean, the free kick's deep enough that Piersci could hold a nice high line, so they're holding that line right on the 18-yard box line, which means that if they lose the header, which they did, there's got to be some header to beat Donnaroma from outside of the penalty spot, and it was just safely gathered up by him. Comfortable save, routine save, as Arsenal come again, Odegaard to Bricayo Saka, Saka back and fit now after that concern, you were there weren't you, at Portman Road when he received that tackle from Leif Davis, but came on as a substitute against Crystal Palace last Wednesday to much reliefier, I can tell you. Windsor throw in. You know, a lot of the fans were right by that side of the pitch at Portman Road, and there was just like a quiet shock of, oh no, Saka's out, but he's managed to shrug it off and get himself fit and available. Arsenal going all the way back to goalkeeper Ryan, 10 yards inside his own half, gets the ball away from Dempale, long pass from Martin Alley's in an offside position, and it's a free kick to PSG. To go back to the referee, as I mentioned, Champions League final referee last season, so by that definition, you know, they consider him to be either the best or one of the best, and you can understand why he's been appointed to this tomorrow night. Clive and Turpan is refereeing tomorrow night. Right, okay, he's made some good calls so far as well, isn't he? Yeah, given away by Nuno Mendes, and that means Arsenal could be in business, Odegaard then writes infield to Merino, a little pass through the middle, Odegaard just couldn't get there. Schuau-Nevers was able to get the crucial touch for Paris Saint-Germain, but Arsenal just beginning to show one or two sights of their better play, shall we say. But here's Hakimi, a game bursting for it. Hakimi up against Kivio, is able to get there first, giving it to Schuau-Nevers. Now Clare it's Kaleor again against Tim by Schutze, Cross took a deflection, but that took it into the path of Ryan, who was able to drop down onto it on his left side. Hakimi's had the breakfast, but he's flying up and down this pitch, he really is, I mean, it's tough to contain at the moment on that right-hand side. Moroccan international, maybe a nice Moroccan breakfast. Maybe. They do those lovely eggs, don't they? That's right. It's that Moroccan breakfast. That's right, yeah. Fold again. Here is Merino, Merino, now to the left-hand side to Trossard, Trossard with a pass to Martinelli, who's on the left wing. Martinelli up against Hakimi, he's got to defend now, then plays it back though, Lewis Scali, his ball into the box, Trossard is there, left side of the area, and then from the angle, a weak shot really that was straight at Donnaroma, and he was able to pat it down. Producer Gary hasn't come up with the answer, engineer Chania has Shakshuka, Gary. I'll let you pronounce that. I'm struggling enough with Karabash Kaleor, to be honest. I don't know if anyone else is having trouble with that one, but it's not rolling off the tongue. Well, sometimes, as Shakshuka rolls off the tongue beautifully, here's Shuao Neves, then to Hakimi, who's on the halfway line. It'll pass back to Shuao Neves, and then back it goes into the PSG half. Nearly half an hour played, Harrison Germain with the edge. Lewis Enrique, already a Champions League winner, remember, as a manager with Barcelona, when he had Messi and Neymar and Luis Suarez, that incredible front line. Unbelievable, that one. Yeah, plus everybody else as well, of course, Busquets, Iniesta. And trying to win it for the second time. He would be hailed in Paris for the rest of his life, if he's the one, if he's the manager, who's able to win this trophy finally for the Qatari ownership. Arsenal back in possession with Saliba, here's Declan Rice, deep-lying position. He's not had the influence yet, Declan Rice in this game. He can't be brilliant all the time, can he? As the ball is passed back by Marino to Raya. We talked about the absence of party. Do you think we're seeing that already in the match? Yeah, I think you see the difference in the balance of the midfield for sure. I mean, it's not ideal because it was just so well oiled and so well put together. The PSG are looking a real threat at times. Certainly in the wide areas, and party really just dropped over into the full-back position and help out in that area. Gronz, because Kibios pass was overhated, put his hands on his head there because he knew that he'd overhate it and it's out of play for a throwing to PSG, halfway inside their own half. Luis Enrique, a little grey in the hair, his curly hair. White trainers on tonight, but all in black and he's got a sort of zip-up, sort of blues on, like a light bomber jacket, isn't it, that he's wearing? Television cameras have shown us that Arsene Venger is here, he's got a bit of a pained expression on his face, Matt, to make sure you saw, by the number of times. He's seen that a few times, well actually not that often, but he's good to see him here, enjoying this game for sure. He was the manager last time Arsenal were in a Champions League semi-final and indeed the only time Arsenal were in a Champions League final in 2006. That season, the Villarreal remember in the semi-finals when Jens Lehmann made that penalty save from Riquelny, right at the end of the second leg in Spain. Very tight semi-final that one. Long and forward for PSG, but Nuno Mendes has hit that straight out of play, so it's a throw into Arsenal, the other halfway line. It is Burton, Wigan, Niel at half time in the League One match tonight. And Arsenal, Tim Bap is being told to go back into his own half for this throw in. Which he takes infield to Odegaard, who lifts it over the top of Pacho, but Pacho got his body in the way of Odegaard and it was played back to Donnarumma. Just in my eye line there, the PSG fans behind Donnarumma in the stands, so vibrant. They're on their feet, they're waving their arms and their flags in the air, giving their teams terrific support. This is a little case of what it'll be like in the park de France next week. Long pass from Vic... This is for Dembale to chase onto. Dembale up against Saliba, he's forced him wide, he's done well Saliba. Still Dembale in possession though. Dembale with a ball at his feet, those orange boots, clips in across, all the way to do it, Deleon is right foot, shoots the ball, brilliant save, Raya. Comes out to Kavaretz-Kelia, Kavaretz-Kelia right foot, hits the post, bounces out and then Arsenal scraping away, not out of play yet, and then the offside flag comes. And I think that was against Kavaretz-Kelia, so I'm not sure the goal would have stood. But that looked for all the world, that the Kavaretz-Kelia shot would hit the post and deflect into the goal, but it stayed out. Well that's another brilliant piece of quality of play from PSG. I mean they switch flank, so Dua has just come over to the left-hand side and Kavaretz-Kelia has gone over to the right. And it just threw Arsenal a little bit, I think it's the shot that came in before the one that came off the post, that's the offside, but the effort from Dua was brilliantly saved from David Ray, it really had to adjust his weight and get down low to his right-hand side. But I have to say, John, there is a big warning signs in this game and Arsenal can't afford to go too down. This front three, that actually they weren't at their best at Villapark. Of all of the matches we've seen recently live, that was the match in which the front three had least impact, but they looked mighty dangerous here tonight, this three with Barclay on the bench and got Salor Ramos as well. I mean he's done nothing wrong Barclay, to lose his place in the team. He's had a good season, he's been playing well, but I've just seen a couple of flashes from Dua over the far side and he's on this near side now because they've switched, he looks super bright with his feet. So here is now Cavarra to Kealier, who's actually central, he's received this ball in the centre circle but then makes his way out towards the right-hand side. What we don't know is whether that, if Dua had found the net with that shot that was really outstandingly saved by Raya, whether that would have stood. I think that was okay, I think it's then the one from, the one off the post that the flag went up. So one nil to Paris Saint-Germain, it could easily be more. That save there could be absolutely, it was big pivotal Arsenal hold. But the signs are, I have to say, if you've just switched on to us and have heard the news, Ousman Dembele scoring his 32nd, his 33rd goal of the season, it's looked more like a second PSG goal than an equaliser for Arsenal. Now, Martin Ali has been dispossessed by Fabian Ruiz, he's tackling back, illegally says the referee, fell Fabian Ruiz who went to ground near the centre spot and it's a free kick to the French champions. Yes, a shame, Martin Ali, great reaction after losing the ball but then the tackle, he's got to almost like hook his foot around to try and win it. If he'd done that, I don't think Fabian Ruiz knew he was there. And I'm looking at the midfield and we talked about the physicality of Arsenal in that area of the pitch. Well, for me at the moment it's been PSG that have got the upper hand in and out of possession. They've just been brilliant through the middle and then the front three are coming to life with the ball when they get fed. Matthew Ubson, Arsenal in England, defender, Champions League player, Premier League winner with Arsenal. During the finger years, here's Dembele on the left flank, Timber has had a tough night, Timber is able to win the ball this time and pass it forward. I think he's happy that they've had a little switch up from Duay's over his side now and he can try something a little bit different. I don't know which one you prefer. I know which one you'd prefer. I know what was uncomfortable was Cavarra's Celia. Yeah, in some ways actually it's a surprise that they've done that. Yeah, I mean he was really putting Timber under pressure wasn't he, now he's going to have a good go at Lewis Skelly. Cavarra's Celia swings a high pass right across the field. Well here it is now, it's Duay against Timber. Timber backpedaling, Saka's able to get a touch in on that arriving to help him out. But he couldn't get the ball away Saka, so had to give it back to Timber, who then passes it back to Saka, who is being fouled by Fabian Ruiz and you can hear Arsenal supporters on their feet, bang for a yellow card for Fabian Ruiz but it's only a free kick. I mean the best way to describe this game at the moment is that the two wide of the front three of PSG are having way more of the ball than what the two wide of Arsenal's front three are in Martinelli and Saka, they're not really being impactful at all in this opening 35 minutes but you know the two wide for PSG of that front three have just had so much of the ball and creating a lot of damage. One nil PSG, could easily be two, with that excellent save from Ruiz from Duay, but Arsenal now coming forward, they've been up against it during this first half, but Trossard, Miles Lewis-Skelia's there, he shields the ball and is challenged and wins a free kick. I mean he's one of the best at that Lewis-Skelia, he really is, he puts body between man and ball so well, he's very... It's little John McGinn, hasn't he? He just throws himself in there, and he knows that worst case scenario, if he can't twist out or wriggle out of it, he wins a free kick and he's done it in an area that's quite deep, it's relatively central, it's probably about 18-yard box wide, but a good 15 yards or so deeper, but it's still got enough angle for Martín Odegaard to be able to wrap his left foot around this ball and put a delivery into the box that is in range of scoring from with a header. What a dream season he's having, isn't he? Miles Lewis-Skelly, only made his debut in September, now he's in England international, scored on his debut, he was Tuchel's first match, playing in Champions League semi-finals, been part of a team that beat Real Madrid, played very very well in that as well, wins the free kick here, and Odegaard's going to take this dangerous position, Odegaard's delivery doesn't beat Kaveras-Skelia, who is the first man who is able to easily head it away, that was a waste, that was unlike Arsenal, long and forward from Raya, centre-circle, that's Chester down on the left-hand side, Marino pulls it back, all raised, challenged, challenged, vice-round there there's, and now Dona Roma has been involved in something, Marquinhos has fallen over, and Marino is down inside the six-yard box as well, the referee spotted it all, he's blown his whistle, and he's run over there to find out what's going on, Marino, I think maybe Marino and Marquinhos have come together. Wow, it's a brilliant piece of defensive midfield play, Jaunevers, I mean, he is that type of player that just gets about the pitch, and he's right on cue here, Marino about to pull the trigger, Kibir, cuts the ball back, he's six yards out, if he's not there Jaunevers, he's in the back of the net, and I think that Marino has just slot that home, but he gets there and he gets across fairly, and he wins the ball, he toes the ball away, and Marino kicks the back of his leg, which is where the rough and tumble came from, really ends up on the floor, Marino, and then there's a little bit of afters, but super play from Jaunevers, really does his job well for his team. That's the best we've seen from Arsenal actually. Yes, best chance by far. But as you say, Matt, Jaunevers has tackled, I mean that was exemplary. So, one 0 PSG lead, this is five live from the BBC, live from the Emirates stadium in Barney, north London, here's Saka, Saka with his heels on the white line, Kibir, it's Kaley has come back, Saka tries to go past him, Kibir puts in the challenge, Saka keeps his feet then shoots from the angle, it's straight at Donoroma, who for the big man goes down very sharply onto his knee and is able to comfortably feel the bouncing ball. They're still waiting to really get Saka into this game, Arsenal, I mean they've had a couple of little moments, but he's up against a player that's his sparkling form in Mendes, and I think that matchup at the moment is Mendes, he's just coping pretty well with Saka and we'll have to wait and see how that goes. Oh, Pacho was too casual there, Saka's went it back from him, Saka takes it back out of the penalty area, plays it square, Marino then Marino rolls it out to the left to Trossard, and PSG are now back in position, that was very casual from Pacho, Saka though still, centrally, Saka back to Trossard, who's got PSG players either side, oh Saka's done brilliantly, he's beaten two of them and then gets the ball in, oh the stretch part of Ellie can't get there, and the ball drifts between him and the goal, and all the way through for a goal kick beyond the far post. Yeah, just as I said Saka isn't influenced by the game enough, he pops up on the other side, I mean he gets all the way over to the left, just as the play develops, I will say. PSG don't off get blue shirts around the man on the ball, they really do try and suffocate any player that has it, but he whips a lovely ball in Saka with his left foot over the top of Donnarama and Martinelli at full stretch, I mean it looks like he could have done it, maybe a little bit better with the contact, he is at full stretch in fairness to him, but he tries to get his right foot on, he's got an open goal to put the ball in the back of the net, he just can't get the contact. Dembele with a challenge, both jumping for the ball on Declan Rice, that's a free kick, Luis Enrique doesn't like that decision, so one nil it is, could easily have had more than the one goal, but just that opener in the fourth minute from Booseman Dembele, shot in a post from the edge of the area created by Gavaritz Kaliar, well actually the move started by Dembele and finished by the French World Cup winner himself, who has now scored 28 goals in his last 28 appearances, that is the measure of him, and he is right on contention for the much talked about Ballon d'Or with a record like that. Raya takes this long out there, pulled across by Marino, takes a deflection which took it up in the air and Donnarama calmly caught it, arms stretched above his head, but the long free kick causing problems there. Yeah it was, it's been attacked doesn't it, any free kick around the halfway line, Raya is all the way up and Arsenal are taking every opportunity they can to put the ball in the PSG box and rightly so actually Marino does so well to keep that alive. Timber, Timber grappling with Gavaritz Kaliar, but legally and then ball out of play, Gavaritz Kaliar claiming that that should have been a PSG throw, the man who was signed from Napoli in January, which is the Napoli might win the league in Italy after a mini collapse from Inter, Napoli currently top of the table. It just seems like a weaker so Antonio Conte was explaining why it was he wasn't going to win the league with Napoli, now there they are at the top of the table. Here's Raya, Raya slipping as he plays the ball downfield, Saka chasing, Nuno Mendes, Nuno Mendes gets a hand in the back and then Saka wins it back, but the free kick's given, Saka's furious. Is it yellow card for that? Oh and the yellow card is out for Saka as well and I think that's for kicking the ball away. That is Kairnus. Yeah it is, it is. It's lost his cool there for Kairnus, Saka. Not often you see that, really don't see that very often, but the referee's pulled it back with the linesmen shall we say, for the foul on Mendes, who I don't think you're going to get much change out of him in terms of beating him for pace over the top, he's really quick, but there's a little shove from Saka and it really isn't a lot and I think Mendes is deciding shall I go down off for that? Can I just fall off the ball? He doesn't and then Saka, for me, cleanly wins the ball in the tackle, but it's almost brought back for the little shove which actually isn't enough to put him to ground, but you know when you're behind a player, you do give him a little nudge and the momentum's there, he does it like a foul. Arsenal have lost it, but that was excellently recovered by Marino. I thought Dembalo was going to be in there and Arsenal played away from the back, Tim back, excellent challenge from Kvarets Kalia and Kvarets Kalia now cutting in field, Timber tries to catch him and he does and Timber comes out with the ball and then he's fouled by Hakeemi and that's a free kick, it's a second and now there's the yellow card that comes for the PSG right back and he's the first Paris Saint-Germain player to be booked by referee Vintcourt. Yeah Arsenal need a little bit more of that from what what Timber just showed there, you lose the ball, you get back in, you muscle the player out the way, they need to show a bit more physicality for me in this game Arsenal, if they do it and confident enough to do it, they've got the match in that sense and Hakeemi had to foul him and it's his second foul of that type which is why the yellow card came out. But moments before that the Saka yellow card that was for kicking the ball away, it wasn't for the challenge on Nunomendes and a couple of points to be made there. I think I'm right in saying aren't I that Arsenal have had two men sent off this season receiving second yellow cards for kicking the ball away, rice and trussard, Manchester City and do you remember a very famous red card that was shown to van Persie in the Champions League for kicking the ball away. Here is Oregard in the centre circle and Marino is pulled over by Marquinhos, that's a free kick, now Marinho is saying to the referee, arm stretched forward, what about that for a yellow card, the referee keeps it in his pocket, free kick taken quickly, here's Saka on the right, we're in the 45th minute, we could talk about this first half for the entire halftime break, couldn't we? Kelly Cates is here with us, she will set out probably to do that, here is Miles Lewis-Gallie. Oh lovely pass, Martinelli is in, saved by Donnarama and then it deflects away and then there's a foul by Saka, one on one Martinelli and Donnarama makes the save. Well that's the moment of the game for Arsenal for sure and Donnarama has come up with the answer, brilliant save from him, I mean he's on his right foot, lovely slip pass in between Hakimi and Paco, gets it a little bit caught under his feet Martinelli and you're never too confident with his finishing in terms of this position, he's not clinical enough when you get to this level, you have to take those chances, if anything I think he's probably better off going high and into the near post, like throwing a bit of disguise on it because Donnarama's so big and is able to get his big hand on the ball as you're shaping up to go to the far post and then Odegard was going to pull the trigger, the ball was popping out to him but it just didn't make it to him, really good chance for Arsenal. Yeah in the added time, one minute of added time the whistle's going to go any minute now, referee Vintcich, I think he'll be pleased to get into his dressing room at half time, Slavko Vintcich and there is the halftime whistle and before he gets into his dressing room he's going to be booed off the field, I can tell you that much but there we are halftime Arsenal nil, Paris Saint Germain won the early goal from Dan Ballet but the chance right at the end of the half, Martinelli who ran away and scored in the Burnabout, the clinching goal didn't he, took that away beautifully but wasn't able to beat Donnarama here tonight. No, he just wasn't able to find the finish and it was a lovely slipped move, I just feel like Arsenal in the last five, ten minutes, I think they've just realised they've got to make this game a little bit ugly, a little bit scruffy and really make life difficult for PSG who have been very dominant in his first half. Yeah and it was indeed very loudly and throttily booed off the field so it's been a tough match to, tough match to referee Trossard and Saka, yellow carded for Arsenal players, Saka kicking the ball away, Hakimi with that yellow card for Paris Saint Germain so there we are, Arsenal nil, Paris Saint Germain won here at halftime and as I say Kelly Cates is sitting just along from us here. The atmosphere here at the Emirates could be described as as fevered, is there a sense that that's transmitting itself to the pitch do you think? Yeah maybe I think when the game starts like it did, I think it just sends maybe a little bit of panic and then everyone gets a little bit edgy and then you're right, I think the atmosphere changed a little bit and Arsenal have got to kind of wrestle that back, I think the way to do that is by being more dominant, being more physical, the way they've got to this place is by being that team that can cope with what PSG will throw at them and PSG have done what they do very well in the first half, I will say it's been a real challenge for Arsenal. And I know that the officials had a very hostile reception as they were making their way off the pitch, I'm not sure they've got quite as many decisions wrong as maybe the home crowd think but there's certainly been some European fouls given and not given in this one, it feels like a very much a Champions League refereeing performance. Yeah I'd agree with that, I think you know Saka's won the yellow card, you can't disagree with that, you can't kick the ball away once the foul has been given, I mean that was a blatant you know lack of discipline from Saka, I mean it's dissent isn't it and I don't think the referee's got too much, I don't think he's got the balance right, you know the penalty, Schalpen, the Georgian, I just feel that he's running through the players and there's a bit of contact from Lewis Skelly, so I think all in all the referees had a tricky game to manage but I think he's done okay. Yeah and Carreth's Kaleigh are causing all kinds of problems as we know he does, he's all over the pitch for for Paris Saint-Germain as he very often is, every time you look up he's he's somewhere else and it's not it's not a lack of discipline as a player, it's just freedom in that role isn't yeah I mean that they're switching sides he's got the freedom but they work hard as well, I mean they're tracking back, Arsenal getting the ball you're seeing three or four blue shirts, they'd like to suppress, they'd like to to to supplicate an opposition and really make life difficult when they've got the ball and they do that well in numbers, they've got the energy, they've got the legs and like I said the two wide players in the front three, yes they're working backwards but they've been such a threat when PSG have had the ball and Arsenal has really got a game on their hands. Do you think that Arsenal need to be reminded at half time that we're only a quarter of a way through this two-legged tie and there's only one goal in it? I think you've got to stay calm haven't you, I mean the early goal does indicate that and there's plenty of time in this tie, like you say you've got half time here then you've got another full game away from home there's a lot that can happen and you've got to stay in the game when the moments are bad or when the run is going bad you stay in the game because you know there's a lot of football to be played as yet. Julian LeRon is here as well, just checking whether or not you could hear and whether or not you could be heard more importantly and in terms of that first half performance from Paris Saint-Germain, do you think they've been, the word I feel I want to use is smart in that first half? Yeah I have to say for the first 40 minutes because the end is really an Arsenal end with our Martinelli chance but it's an impressive performance, I thought they were just outstanding, not just the goal and the goal really highlighted everything we said pretty much right, this is where party usually is and Rice and Marino and Rice going to double up with Timberg as far as Kelyard, I'm not sure he needs to go there and then Dembele is on his own where he should never be on his own at this level on the edge of the box like this, to see the goal again on our screen is terrible defending from an Arsenal point of view but I thought PSG used Dembele so well when he was dropping, I thought they used their workplace so well like I could hear what Matt just said and I think he midfield for most of that first half, Virginia and Neves and Rice were outstanding later. It's half time in this Champions League semi-final, first leg between Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain, Paris lead by a goal to nil but we are only at the quarter point of this two-legged tie and there is only one goal in it, we'll be back for the second half very shortly first though it's time for the BBC News with Nick Hatfield. The voice of the UK. This is BBC Radio 5 Live. Thank you Kelly, good evening.

A suspect is on the run in Sweden after three people were killed in a shooting in the city of Uppsala. Local media reports say several people were injured in the attack at a hair salon in the city centre. The attack reportedly fled on a scooter. The trial has started if two men accused of cutting down the famous Sycamore Gap Tree next to Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland in 2023. They're charged with criminal damage. Our correspondent Eunice Muller has been at Newcastle Crown Court. Richard Wright Casey said that after their moronic mission, that's how he described it, Daniel Graham from Carlisle and Adam Carruthers from Wicton in Cumbria kept a wedge of that trunk as a trophy. The tree itself of course was in the Northumberland National Park, the whole of this area is part of a UNESCO heritage site. So the trial will be looking into these factors in the coming days. Both men of course denied the charges. And a performance spy rapper's kneecap at the Eden Project in Cornwall in July has been cancelled.

Meanwhile on the other table China Xiao Jing Tong is now seven four up against Chris Waking. Thirteen is the target for a place in the semi-finals. Thank you Jamie. Tomorrow on Five Live Sports you can hear full match commentary of Manchester United against Chelsea in the WSL. Chelsea go into this one off the back of their disappointing exit from the Women's Champions League. They lost a two on aggregate to Barcelona in the semi-finals and the Champions League is the main topic on the latest Women's Football Weekly. That's available right now via the Football Daily podcast with Ben Haynes, Jen BT and Ellen White. The only way to describe it for Chelsea is embarrassing for one. And I think for Barcelona they soaked up all that pressure. I think they knew for the first kind of 20-25 minutes that Chelsea were going to come at them. And I think the difference with Arsenal and what Chelsea did is they picked their moments Arsenal, whereas Chelsea just tried to just go for it. And it wasn't really, I don't think there was like a true plan in it. And then it was just executing everything up the top. Just wasn't there, not the right pass. The finish wasn't good enough. And then when you allow someone like Bonmatti just to run the length of the pitch and just smash it into the back of the net, I feel like you know your shoulders just go down. You just think this is just an even harder task than what we ever thought of. And I feel like it was just, it was just, it felt like a walk in a park for Barcelona from being perfectly honest. And you know I've been there. I've been there with Man City and we've played Barcelona away from home, got destroyed, 3-0. We got absolutely destroyed. We came back home and we're like this will never happen to us again. We are not then losing again 3-0. So we changed it and we won. But over obviously for the whole time we didn't go through. But we looked at each other and thought this could not happen again. We cannot let them come come to our home and destroy us again. We have to be smart. We have to press them in the right areas and we have to finish when we're given the right opportunity. And it just felt like it was Barcelona's to take and that they just destroyed them. I just feel like Chelsea were extremely naive and they looked quite tired if I'm being honest as well. Can I ask what did you, was it a difference in mentality or was it a different in tactics from that going back to the second like when you're saying you changed it? Both I would say. Mentality and also tactics. Slightly tweaked the personnel but then also the tactics. We sat off them a bit too much in that first one. They just destroyed us and we just couldn't get back into the game. And yeah, I think 3-0 was quite a good one to take home to be honest because it could have been a lot more. And then yeah, we changed personnel and tactics and we just went for them. We went gung-ho and they hated it. We pressed them. We were physical. We absolutely attacked them basically. We still obviously lost the tie. But I feel like in yourself you can still go well. We gave everything and we won. But I feel like you cannot go away from home and lose 4-1 and come home and lose 4-1 as well. It's just that's not acceptable. That was Ellen White talking on the Women's Football Weekly. That's available by the Football Daily Podcast on BBC Sound. On Thursday, Nottingham Forest could move to third in the Premier League if they win their game in hand over Brentford. Nuno Esposito Santo has been speaking today. He hasn't been shy in explaining the magnitude of their remaining games this season. To the end, I think the other season of the game is going to be very, very important for all of the teams involved in this fight. We have one game less. Let's try to do it well, perform well. We are back in the Cinti ground. Once again, in front of our fans, it's a big help for us. We never stop believing no matter what happens. Through the competition, we had good moments, bad moments. We've been able to react. And again, it's up to us to react and perform. All the games are the biggest game of our careers. This is how we approach it. And that was Nuno Esposito Santo. And there will be updates of Forest against Brentford on Five Lives Sport on Thursday. Elsewhere today, QPR have placed head coach Marty Sufuentes on gardening leave.

Julianne Laurent is with us. Chilto, they're signed from Arsenal's point of view. They were getting into that game towards the end of the first half, but they were starting to maybe come to terms with the magnitude of the game. Yeah, I think so. And also the final PSG came planned really for the first half hour or 35 minutes, 40 minutes. That's been so good. And I think Vittiniar, Joy Neves especially, started getting a bit leggy at the end of that first half. And that's when you saw a bit more Luis Kelly coming inside in midfield. He created that massive chance for Martin Ely, right at the end. And really, Martin Ely should take it, should do better. But and for us on that, it's keeping that same intensity. Can they do it though? And how will PSG start that second half and respond? Let's find out with your commentary team here at the Emirates, Matt Upton and John Murray. Yes, Jules, just making way off back down to speak to the world. And Matt Upton next to me as we watch the players sprint out of the tunnel and the Arsenal players going into the huddle. Why don't there's any changes at half time up with Seymour. Arsenal with Ryre in goal. What a super save that was from him to keep it at one nil from Douay. Timba, Saliba, Kipio and Luis Kelly. Then Marino, Rice and Odegaard in midfield. Saka and Martin Ely either side of Trossard and Paris Saint-Germain with Donorummer in goal. Big save from him right at the end of the half. He did it at Villa Park and he did it at Anfield. Didn't he in the previous two rounds Donorummer saves? Then Hakimi, Marquinhos, Pacho and Mendes at the back for Vettini with Juaneves and Fabian Ruiz. Douay and Cavarra Scalia with goal scorer Dembele. The one goal of the match so far. First time Arsenal have been behind in a match in the knockout stages of the Champions League this season. So they need to score obviously. Clearly. Last time Arsenal failed to score here. It was the last time they failed to win a match or indeed the last time they lost a match against West Ham in the Premier League. So Arsenal kicking off the second half here at the Emirates. Audegaard back to Raya. Red and white Arsenal shirts tore forward at Hammer Downfield by the Arsenal goalkeeper and they they win a free kick for Juaneves. It's a challenge and the Arsenal player who's gone to ground, who's Marino, who's gone down clutching his head and there's a yellow card for Juaneves. Wow. Must be a flailing arm. That's the only thing I can assume. I mean yeah that's that's a really poor decision from the referee in terms of the yellow card. I think Juaneves jumps, wins the ball. His arms there protect himself. He does catch Marino with his elbow or the side of his arm but that's just a challenge. That's just part of the game. He jumps, he competes well, he wins the ball. Can't quite understand. Certainly not the yellow card but in my book that's not even a foul. Arsenal fans coming back to their seats Matt so we're going to have to yes just get up on our feet to see what happens to the left where Rice is preparing to take this free kick. Arsenal players masked at the back post. So many PSG players. I think everyone is back in there apart from the one-man wall of Dembele. Rice to play this in. Right footed there it goes. Little glance it's in. Arsenal score. It's the equaliser. Arsenal surround Mikhail Marino who stood with his arms raised. Cleansed fist. Marino he scored against Real Madrid now he's scored against Paris Saint-Germain and Arsenal needed that didn't they just second minute of the second half. Arsenal won Paris Saint-Germain won. Big start from Arsenal to the second half. What a needed goal. I mean the free kick will be debated. It's very dubious but Arsenal don't care. It's that famous kind of line of players that all run along a line and then duck into the crowd and Marino's the one that just gets in front of Donorama. The PSG defenders I think it's Pacho in there who's the deepest one or maybe Mendez and he just can't get to the ball ahead of Marino. It's a really good downward glancing head up. I mean it looked a really tight offside and I think they're still having a good look at that referee is paused in and around the centre circle. The offside did look very very tight because when they run that line John they have to then step back on side as the delivery comes in and it looked I mean it was yeah very very tight. Semi-automated offside is in operation in the Champions League. We've not resumed play again. This looks ominous. Goal check is up on all of the screens here waiting to see if that Marino goal will be allowed. Still the wait goes on. The Slovenian officials the video assistant referee is also Slovenian like the referee Alan Borosak and they're just waiting for the decision. We're just about to see it again now. I mean so many players together. I'm not sure. I think there are so many bodies in there. I'm not sure the semi-automated offside will be able to work with that. It won't because they'll have to pinpoint Marino because there were certain other Arsenal players that were offside but they'll have to pinpoint where Marino was and like I said he's such a cluster of shirts that that takes a little bit of time and a little bit of figuring out and sometimes they can't even actually get that point that final point of the body that would be offside because as we know camera angles can get blocked which is why the semi-automated is so important. There are probably we need to see it again but I'm thinking you might have to be looking at maybe six different bodies there. Yeah. To check which part is is beyond the line. It may work in Arsenal's favour in the sense that if it's inconclusive they'll just go with the on field decision. So the referee is walking back now and it's going to be ruled out. It's ruled out so tight, so very very tight and the video assistant referee has ruled that it was offside so the Marino goal is ruled out and it remains Arsenal nil Paris Saint-Germain won. It had that feel about it didn't it? It really did. I mean when you step back in from a cluster of players I mean when you look at it on semi-automated which is being shown on the screen he looks well offside actually like comfortably. It wasn't even that tight but I think just the massive bodies made it tough to figure out. That punctured the atmosphere almost like the Paris Saint-Germain goal in the fourth minute of the first half did and it goes back to one nil Paris Saint-Germain so tight and it was a set piece that brought the inverted commas goal. Rice's free kick as well. Yeah he definitely feels his Arsenal's best play isn't it to put Paris under pressure with the set plays. He's just earning the opportunities to get enough set plays to really make them count. And also the other thing as we discussed before the match, an occasion there from a set piece where Donorumma was unconvincing, didn't come, stayed where he was. No it's difficult and I think Marconios was making that point to the referee to say there's players here they shove them in the referees I saw him just say look it's not my problem this is their set play he's offside on this occasion but they're okay to start offside in the line work their way in and then just duck back in offside onside at the last minute it's just hard for Arsenal to time that perfectly and that time it was it was a fraction out but this set that set players work pretty well and Reyes now banging another one into the box. Yeah here's another long one downfield from the halfway line headed across the box. Marino gets his head to that tross hard shoots that's blocked crowd of bodies and Kivio is going to have a goal that's deflected down into the box and Marconios was there the PSG captain who was able to to whack it away with his left foot and eventually it's defected out of play over on the far side for throwing to Paris Saint-Germain so one nil in the semifinal this is Arsenal's second semifinal of this season. You remember they lost both legs to Newcastle without scoring a goal in the Carabao Cup lost two nil here and two nilots and James as part and actually Michela Tete's record he's lost all three two-legged semifinals as the Arsenal manager they're not scored in their last five semifinal matches. I thought that had been broken there. Back to back negative stats on the outside. Yeah sorry about that. Well the stats the stats John you're just delivering them but they're they're not great are they and this this tie I mean it's a fascinating tie but if Arsenal managed to turn this around or just hang on to this situation and even take a one nil out to Paris and leave it well in the balance I think the way this game has gone it's been a tricky one for Arsenal so far. It has one nil to PSG. It has won a semifinal in his first one but he must have to get to the FA Cup final which he won so there we are there's a positive there you go. Not all doom and gloom. No not all no far from it. Latest scores Burton won Wigan nil and Solihull nil Rochdale won in the national league. One nil Paris Saint-Germain here here is Douay putting in from the right hand side Barcala on the bench for PSG I guess we'll probably see him at some stage usually Douay Douay still going weaving his way and then finally Arsenal get a touch on that Vodegaard but it's won back from Vodegaard's round nevers and then in steps Marino crucially and sets right away but Rash passes it behind Trossard and Trossard remember Arsenal without the suspended party and then that pass from Trossard is on Grace. It's not as much of the ball Trossard in this game at all as he you know he's playing that centre forward role but he's not been too heavily involved he's been very deep at times you know I think that that lack of Thomas Parthay I know we touched on it in the build-up to the game but it's certainly had an impact on the arson team. This is BBC Radio 5 Live live from the Emirates dry spring night PSG leading narrowly second leg in Paris we'll be there for that join us for it next Wednesday night and that will be you and I won't it again for the second leg. I'll keep an eye out for the slippery salami in Paris. Yes we had shoe buns tonight didn't we a little taste of what's to come next week yeah one 0 PSG leading here big week of football commentaries for you all midweek women's super league tomorrow night Manchester United against Chelsea will keep you up to date on Barcelona Inter and then Europa League commentaries on Wednesday night live from Bill Bowell and also Sports Extra with the Tottenham match against Bordel Glint the Norwegians so that will be at the Tottenham Hot Bus stadium on Sports Extra Manchester United's match in Bell Bowell on 5 live. Here is Dembele now near the edge of the Arsenal box work through by Douay Kivyoputs his body in the way of Hikini and Raya is able to come out and collect the bouncing ball untroubled a little shuffle from him to the edge of the area and when they're with those enormous white gloves the Spanish goalkeeper underarms the ball out and Arsenal come back to Declan Rice and Rice moves away from Dembele and now Rice running from deep holds off Douay and then finds the pass to Trossard and Trossard's into the box and Trossard sees his shot saved by Donnarumma brilliantly fingertips down to his left hand side a touch and it was past the post corner what a save I mean I think that is just about nestling maybe off the post and in or in that bottom corner that is a brilliant save but let's just talk about Declan Rice in that move that's the first time we've seen him really open his legs drive past three or four plays fantastic midfield play slip Trossard in and he's hitting the target there Trossard with his left foot it's not a bad finish it's just a world-class save from Donnarumma brilliant piece of play all round he has the scourge of the English clubs Donnarumma corner then Arsenal Saka to take it another set piece chance so Salivas at the back post Kivir is near the penalty spot here it is it's a very deep one which is headed across by Trossard Marquinhos stretching got his head to it for PSG ball still in the area and then it's cleared away by Dutinha downfield and the referee has brought it all the way back because the long he was waiting to see if the long pass would find Dempeli it didn't and he's brought it back for an infringement which just didn't see what that infringement was at all I mean players competing for the ball there might have been a bit a little bit of contact but that just seems a very kind of cheap free kick of anything I think that Kivir actually wins the ball in the tackle from Douay I'm just looking at the replay it's a decent tackle from Kivir he wins the ball Donnarumma hits this downfield flicked on and it's cleared away towards the halfway line by Saliba so we've got just over half an hour of this first leg to play but PSG still one nil up that right there from Declan Rice-John is exactly what we're talking about in terms of that physicality that Arsenal need to show in this game and start to really dominate but now here's Timber pushing quite up and gives it to Saka on the edge of the area challenge from Dron Neves on him and Saka went down nil free kick Arsenal have got it back Audegarde tries to slip it through the middle of the two defenders but Martinelli unable to to reach that it was over hit by Audegarde and Donnarumma has got the ball safely to Paris Saint-Germain again admittedly when we've seen him you know there's been there has been the occasional shaky less convincing moment or two from Donnarumma but some of the saves that he's made in the Champions League matches against the English clubs this season and as I say notably at Villa Park in the previous round long pass called forward by Kivir Martinelli trying to run onto this Marquinhos gets their first passes in backer Donnarumma who very nearly got the ball caught up and underneath his feet Dron Neves has now mis-kicked it, mis-controlled it but he's able to turn and pass it up the line and Gouet takes that ball down brilliant flick said pass Lewis Skellian and pulls Lewis Skellie back and that's a great thing to Arsenal. There is a shift in this game it's happening Arsenal have come out in the second half and realised that they need to be more confident they need to be more dominant they need to be more physical and there've been all those things. Well like Villa work? Absolutely and just not kind of play within yourself as the team and I think there was a little element of that in the first half because the start from PSG was so strong but they've come back out in the second half and they're really now starting to make life difficult for PSG which is what you'd expect. Yeah one nil at the moment that in itself would be a huge score line to have to overturn in the part de France next week. Here's Timberville for Arsenal Timbersport little it takes a deflection as it is clipped across the box but that took it out of the penalty area and now PSG are interested in the counter attack. Hakimi's pass forward Lewis Skellie it's Lewis Skellie against Dua the 19 year old against the 18 year old excellent little contest that we might be watching that for years to come. He does this little thing Lewis Skellie just grabs the player and pulls him towards it might just kind of clamps onto them sometimes. Muno Mendes, PSG trying to play it out from the back which they do effectively to Dembele who runs into Trossard but Dráun Neves receives it from him and now here is Atraf Hakimi the Moroccan right back, Viquinha then to Dembele 25 yards out Dembele into the box little ball excellent sliding tackle by Saliba very very good indeed and Hakimi who is furthest forward but a super tackle from Saliba in his own penalty area Arsenal come forward again Marino's ball deflects to Trossard just in front of Lewis Enrique and Nicolà Teta and Nicolà Teta picks the ball up then Trossard's down suggesting that Dua pushed him over. It's a little trick tiny little kind of trip that just happened when the tackle came in the ball went out and I think there was just a little something but this is a game now John this really has changed in the second half it's ramped up a little bit. Has it got a little bit of the air of the field of the second half against Real Madrid? It has it's just got the crowd the belief the physicality Arsenal applying with it just seemed a bit more confident in the second half. Arsenal take this throw in the halfway line back to Kivillor in for the injured Gabrielle don't forget and there's no Havertz no Gabrielle no Giorginho either so as well as Pate they haven't got Giorginho to call on and Califiore's out of this as well so it's quite a lengthy Arsenal injured list and PSG are pretty all healthy hasn't it? The only slight worry they had was over Dua but he's out now and here he is excellent again beats two men then in comes the challenge final challenge from Marino that's a foul I mean his feet are so quick can't they Dua? When he gets going he is tough to stop it's like just jinky light feet small little touches of the turf and he's bang his up and his off and he just gets to the ball first Marino makes the final tackle I mean there's a step over there's a roll of the ball under his foot and Marino just just hoops him up in the air and then gets up and knocks him over and I don't mind that that's the mode that Arsenal are in it's like you know you're on our patch you're going to come to our stadium life's not going to be easy for you. For PSG Clare Tuglia, Saliva comes he leans into Clare Tuglia who goes down but as he tried to work the ball away on the ground he actually passed it to Arsenal who break forward here's Tossar Passing it back to Lewis Skelly now the Polish international Kivio which gets there first but given away oh and Dempeli if he'd been able to receive that ball passed forward by Marquinhos just beyond them and through to Raya. Yeah just slightly loose ball from Kivio who overran it but the speed in which Marquinhos saw that and just tried to capitalise on what really is a minor error but he really nearly made Kivio pay for that. Near the Arsenal you near the PSG supporters who are singing in unison in one corner jumping up and down it's like a it's like a mini part de France over there that corner of the Emirates right now one nil to PSG. Marino through to Tossar who just gets there and kicks it back past Marquinhos turns again he's under pressure now from Fabian Ruiz as the Arsenal number 19 but he's done well Marino now here is Declan Rice. Rice thought about the forward pass goes square to Timber and the Dutchman Jury and Timber finds the Norwegian, Audegarde then back from Timber here is Saka Saka right out there on the right wing against Nero Mendes. Audegarde is able to receive it from him Audegarde's ball along the edge of the penalty area. Tossar trying to turn in the D plays it back out to Marino it's very congested in there and Marino's pass hits Joao Neves and PSG have got it back on the edge of their area promising again from Arsenal there promising however PSG break forward again there's a PSG player down Douay but PSG are just keeping an eye on him and Dempelet I think was thinking about putting the ball out of play but he's but he's knocked him and he's now back in action and he runs the ball across the field and here is Douay who's got to his feet and is involved in this attack but the momentum of it has now gone completely and PSG have to go back towards the halfway line 25 minutes of this first leg to go still just the one very early goal scored by Dempelet the home supporters try to do their bitch again Hakimian, Joao Neves so effective little Joao Neves isn't he another of the youngsters 20 years old he's made two interception tackles that have just been right at the right at the perfect time to stop a goal that's how important it's been for PSG I mean he's here there and everywhere doing all the ugly work picking the ball up pressing never stops running but he's made two challenges that have just been crucial yeah number 87 he was superb remember when you and I saw him in the win against Matt just with me yes he was right scored one of the goals yeah here is Vitigna dragging the ball back and playing it to the edge of the area I think I said that night Joao Neves has got the build of Verratti hasn't he yes the former PSG midfielder the Italian international he's solidly built ball is with Pacho in his own penalty area he has Nunomendes Nunomendes, Joao Neves then passes it straight out of play and the time on its style he's lavished in with praise and he passes it straight out for a throw. Well he's under pressure and that's been the difference Arsenal have got closer there's more pressure Rice, Merino, Odegaard they're just getting after that midfield three and they're finding it hard at the moment PSG to get a hold of the ball have any consistent possession and Arsenal really trying to apply the pressure. From here Mechalatata would absolutely take one-one to take to Paris next week as it is they're one nil down, thought that they'd got the equaliser early in the second half so that was ruled out for offside. Raya long long pass to Saka then to Odegaard little bit of space for the Arsenal captain goes round Pacho then across to Merino his cross in that comes off a PSG head which takes it out towards the right hand side timber racing with Cavarra's Kehlia and it is the the Georgian who gets there first knocks it up and bullies it away but actually he's it straight out of play for a three to Arsenal down in that far corner opposite side of the field to our left Arsenal take the throw back towards the halfway line Declan Rice seven goals this season four of them in the Champions League Merino allows the ball to run through his legs he was expecting I think Miles Lewis-Skelly to be there behind him but Lewis-Skelly was closer to the halfway line so Arsenal did well actually Martin Alley to keep it in play. When Declan Rice decides to run past someone it's it's happening he just knocks it opens up his stride he's got so much power through his legs that he just drives past people in midfield. Well that's exactly what Miles Lewis-Skelly is doing now through the middle gives it to Saka Saka edge of the box couldn't attempt the pass well attempted the pass wasn't able to execute it and PSG were able to say thank you very much and take it away to the halfway line well we've not had a single substitution yet and we are now into the final quarter of this first leg but I think that's probably what Lewis Enrique is thinking about and he's watching Dan Bele here go away from Kivio down the right hand side but Arsenal quickly back in position and Hakimi was there to play back to Marquinhos near the halfway line. You know it's a good game and the time just flows and then you just only seen like a minute ago that half time started and you look at the clock now and go wow with this way Farin may only be just over 20 minutes left I mean it's such a enthralling game and I can see why there's been no substitutions because it's just been a flowing matchup a football hasn't it and it must start to be on the coach's minds now to think right okay with this Farin how can we impact the game how can we change the game and I think Lewis Enrique is very close to making a change. Nicolateta was running up and down the side of the pitch there urging his team to press. I think somebody's just been sent up the PSG line there to have a word with is that Barcola. Yeah Barcola yeah and here comes Arteta again sprints forward almost sprints onto the pitch he did used to play for both of these teams. He had his debut on loan for the PSG from Barcelona he was talking he was a teenager at the time was talking so fondly about that yesterday Dembele has just sat down and the referee says that he will add time on Nicolateta is furious he can't understand why the referee stopped play clearly Arsenal players are saying for the referee but he's again pointing to his watch the referee slaps up in chitch and saying to to the Arsenal players the time will be added on. Yeah I get that it's not about the time being added on though is it it's about the flow and the rhythm of the game and Dembele's back up on his feet walking around now no problem doesn't need to stop the play for him you can sit on the floor and your team can have 10 men or you can get up and play the game that should be the message from the referee not you can sit down and I'll stop the game for you because he's up on his feet and he's okay so players are taking an opportunity to bring the water bottles on high live sport will be on air tonight till 10 30 so Julianne LaRonde will join us again I've just spotted that that Rory Smith is just sitting just to the right of Kelly so Rory Smith with Monday nightclub fame Dembele is substituted so Bradley Barclay is on for Dembele. Yes is it? Douay will now yeah looks like Douay is slipping inside into the central position to occupy the role that Dembele had and Barclay is on the right hand side Kavarashkelia on the left hand side who has been much quieter in this second up and that's a good indicator that Arsenal have been a different animal since the break because they've kept the wide plays much much quieter they've had a lot more defensive work to do PSG. Barclay started on the on the right hand side now or he himself 18 goals and 16 assists this season he's done nothing wrong can't can't get in the team so the referee is finally I mean that was a lengthy stoppage that is going to for what as well well I know I know he's gone off Dembele but you know just just just wait for the ball to go out of play and make the substitution. Arsenal nil Paris Saint-Germain won in the first leg of this Champions League semi-final Arsenal's first semi-final in this competition for 16 years since they lost to Manchester United back in 2009 that was Alex Ferguson against Arsenal and Arsenal now trying to get themselves on the score sheet with something to take to Paris. Ball is played in field by Kibbe Or to Saliba and then Timber here is Saka Arsenal certainly looking to Saka to to create that piece of magic that they need against the French champions. Last round Arsenal knocked out the Spanish champions he has Martin Elliott way down the left his left foot had crossed in that's headed away on the edge of the box it was little Petinha who was back in there to head it away Arsenal again whether it's Martin Elliott on the left or Saka on the right that's what Arsenal need that bit of incisiveness somebody to to produce the the inspiration the moment of quality that can break down Paris Saint-Germain Arsenal go long again Saliba's pass that is taken down there on the right by Timber then it comes in field to Odegaard Odegaard 25 yards out Rice now forward of the centre circle Rice upright looks to his left fact goes back to Kivio then the pass to Martin Elliott heals on the white line Martin Elliott past Barca that but then uses the pass to Luis Scali Kivio goes squared good zip about the passing here for Arsenal but we're into the last 20 minutes now here at the Emirates. Odegaard's left foot has passed down the right hand side Timber over there in the full back position drags it back to the corner of the box Odegaard lifts it in deep but Donnaroma comes and is able to claim that quite easily really for a goalkeeper of that standard. It's not quite enough pace on the cross from Martin Odegaard Arsenal working it really patiently nice amount of passing and Odegaard gets the ball on the inside right position on his left foot that in swinging whipped ball that he normally plays so well he just lofted it a little bit too much made it easy for Donnaroma to decide to come and claim plenty of time to come and take that ball and Arsenal have just lacked you mentioned a moment ago John that little bit of incisiveness that moment from a sack of from an Odegaard that's really punchy I mean Declan Rice showed it with that driving run with the save from Donnaroma but other than that it hasn't really been much produced from Arsenal. David Grier long pass out from the back that Timber's going to do well to keep in play does jumping with his head but ball in field. Cavarad Schalers going for a goal from way way out but it did not threaten Grier's goal it dropped well wide and behind and we're going to see Gonzalo Ramos coming on very shortly for PSG so second Paris Saint-Germain change coming right up so the Portuguese international who himself has scored 15 goals this season Gonzalo Ramos and we saw him score against Manchester City didn't we? Cross-eyed is felled by Joana there's not a pre-game to Arsenal just outside their own box not sure if it'll happen now will it no not yet Kivio's long pass Timber's got a bit of time here Clarit Kehle was chasing back Saka back to Timber who took his eye off the ball and that meant that Nuno Mendes was able to just get a foot in there Arsenal come again Odegaard Miles Lewis Skelly and then Kivio looks for Rice who's dropped a little deeper into the centre circle Rice's pass forward Saka rather tucked in position on the right hand side then goes wider to Timber Saka continues his run down into the full back position then turns looks to get into the penalty area but excellent defending Nuno Mendes just stepped in shows that he can defend as well Nuno Mendes brilliant tremendous I will say Saka's had to play around with his positioning because I know that he's getting much change out of him 1v1 when he tries to isolate him wide Saka loves to draw players out wide and hug the touch line but he's coming inside the pitch because he's just not getting enough of the ball and he's having to pick it up in a bit more of a central area well it's it's just become rather cagey this over the over the recent minutes because I'm sure Paris Saint-Germain they would absolutely take this score line we will see Gonzalo Ramos coming on so it's another attacking player who is going to replace I presume that is Douay coming off he's walking over here yeah to to this side of the field and Luis Enrique is going through a it's quite pet guardiola that isn't it the the hand signals there then his hands behind his back then one hand in the air and that was all for Cabaret's calias benefit presuming knows what that means I have no clue I mean he gave him a little nod at the head John that's all he needed just to know message well and truly receive well all of the all of the exertions that Luis Enrique goes through has has been well documented the iron men challenges the marathons the cycling you saying yesterday been walking recently he is in great great shape 54 years old he looks as though he could still play his older guard into the area for tross art right side of the box Saka now it's very very tight in there lots of PSG second as well gets the shot in and Donna Roma resolved nemesis is able to make the save just drops down at the near post but actually the offside flag was up so had Saka scored that one would not have stood either well that must have been from very early on in the play in the build up when the ball gets fed out to Saka and it just gets slipped into to tross art initially who then rolls it back to Saka and he is half a yard offside yeah right decision right decision just very late flag so Gonzalo Ramos the number nine is now playing through the middle and partners he ever and Gonzalo Ramos is on to this and lays it square and Barca could be in Barca back to the edge of the area but John now there's lifted over the top who asked no we're exposed for a moment there they've got away with that there they have there's a real breakaway chance it was like a ricochet off of a pass and it just spun into the path of a PSG player it's a clearance from Kivir I think and it rebounds off his own player then Ramos is on the ball feeds it wide it comes back inside to Jaunebbers and he just doesn't get over the top of the ball and it's always rising over the crossbar just a little warning for Arsenal gotta be careful too near will be a disaster tross art strong there against Marquinhos and he's able to to use Marino he holds it up as well Saka does find some space on the right there's been precious little of that but Kvaratskjelja is back there with Nuno Mendes Saka puts his foot on the ball all left foot then uses Odegaard behind him fair hair bobbing Kivir steps forward to join the attack now it's on the left hand side with Martin Ellie Martin Ellie comes in field right for the ball clipped in and it's headed away to the edge of the area where Fabian Ruiz is able to take it down and Fabian Ruiz will just keep possession time beginning to kick down here just over 10 minutes to play in the Emirates and PSG with the advantage and we know I think anyone who's watched Paris Saint-Germain play at the Parc de France this season will know how effective they are particularly in the latter half of the season and yes Liverpool won there Liverpool won with that Harvey Elliott goal when when Allison had a wonder night yeah but they were brilliant that night brilliant against Aston Della brilliant against Manchester City and they're winning one now here with a very effective away from home performance Fabian Ruiz stabs it out towards the left hand side Kvaratskjelja gets his head down now running at timber again as he did time and time again in the first half across the box Kvaratskjelja with the shot though but he's got right underneath that and skied it high across goal and behind into the Arsenal fans yeah just shooting on balance there as he cuts his side onto his right foot Arsenal good distances much better than the first half they've got a little bit tighter a little bit bolder with how they wanted to fend up against PSG and it's paid off in this second half and I think they'll take a lot from this second half into the second leg if I'm honest John I mean if it stays at this or whatever the score line may be I think they'll take a lot from this second half for sure Aston they'll realise how they need to go about this time in the second leg to really win it well they won in the Burnabyal yeah but I think against this team and with Real Madrid in the shape that they were at the time yeah I actually think it's more of a challenge to go and win in the park at the park which is a big statement no I completely agree with that I think you spot on I think Thomas party coming back in will make a big difference there's been certain instances in this game where you just know he would be there that little one that dropped down the edge of the box on the opposition box a moment ago he reads that and he picks up that ball it's not easy for PSG just to get hold of it and then get some possession going he's been a big miss tonight well Michela Teter is going to turn to Ben White and that's going to be the first change Arsenal have made and we are now in the 81st minute which I think tells its own story in terms of options on the bench I mean one area is there but only 18 years old just turned 18 Raheem Sterling the ball in the centre circle with Saliba Arsenal desperately want a goal to take for the park difference Nikolaj Teter is called on the crowd to increase the noise long pass forward but Donnaroma comes forward and is able to take that ball too big save from Donnaroma tonight from Martin Ali just before halftime and that's super save from Trossard second one was brilliant same time Raya made the very good save from Dhuye in the first half too so both goalkeepers have played apart so just the one goal so far tonight it is now Burton one Wigan one equaliser very late equaliser for Wigan so it's one one there and actually it's all over and that means that Burton are safe in league one for the next season so congratulations to them one nail to Paris Saint-Germain more European commentaries to come on Thursday night Ian Dennis and Paul Robinson will be making their way to Bill Bowell with Manchester United you'll hear that on five live and Alastair Bruce Ball and Rob Green will bring your commentary on top mum against Vodoglimp on Sports Extra on Thursday night you'll be able to hear all three of us on the commentators view podcast later in the week ask them with a ball inside their own half and referee spotter the handball in there and that's a free kick Lewis Enrique is going absolutely wow on the side of the pitch yeah and um changes being made now to bring on Ben White straight swap Timber's coming off yeah Ben White on yeah Timber's just a little bit hobblings I don't think he's got an injury but whether or not it's just fatigue then fresh set of legs on the right hand side he's had a tough evening Timber he's had a lot of one on one action to have to deal with yes he has you know really tough night in fact I suspect it'll be as challenging tonight as he's had all season I agree Paul headed away by Arsenal Kavaratskalia the same time those bouncing PSG fans in the corner well we're talking about maybe Arsenal getting a goal those Paris Saint-Germain supporters the Ultras the self-styled Ultras will be thinking their team can get another one make it 2-0 they can whip up an atmosphere that popped the France as well can't they we can sample a bit of that against Manchester City but this atmosphere in the second leg will be pretty special oh a touch there from Consola Ramos Barquela's in Barquela rolls the shot across goal and way to the far post that could probably should have been 2-0 PSG wow what a lovely piece of play that is from PSG lovely given goes one two's Barquela does everything right I'm looking at Lewis and Rickey just spins round to the bench with his head in his hands knowing what big chance that is Ramos just pokes it through to him gets there ahead of Kivillot and the finish with his right foot it's a little bit scuffed if I'm honest he doesn't get a clean contact and just drags it about an inch wide of the far post what a big moment at the other end another offside flag against Arsenal so a free kick to PSG it's a wonder we've had only one goal here yeah I mean it's had play that deserves more for sure but I think both teams defensively have done an excellent job I mean it's been you know both have been tough to break down and I think that's been the main reason John and also some top goalkeeping as well to add to that yes one nil to Paris Saint-Germain another little interesting side of this as well that Arsenal have actually got to be a little bit careful with the home match against Bournemouth in terms of who plays in that long pass forward that is taken down by Gonzalo Ramos who dinks it against the crossbar and that was there a flag there or not I couldn't tell you it looked like half a flag came up I mean well he was through I have to say I thought he was probably offside it was a bizarre moment but it's a goal kick yeah I mean it looked like Saliba or Kibbutz it just stopped I mean he was I think he was it looked very very tight but neither player Kibbutz didn't trap back and Saliba didn't really get out to him and then it's a weird kind of toe pun from Ramos the shot is bizarre he doesn't really put his foot there he just toe punts it it was rattles off the crossbar and up into the air and and Arsenal looked like the game had stopped and he was been given offside but he hadn't so that's a let-off for Arsenal as well Barcala and Gonzalo Ramos now could have made it two nil still one nil and time running out now we're into the last five minutes of this first leg here at the Emirates BBC Radio 5 Live with the drama of the Champions League semi-finals and again here's one for Hakimi to chase and Miles Lewis Kelly sort of runs it slows down he puts his body in the way of Hakimi and is pushed over that is what he does he uses his body in between man and ball I'll take the foul thanks right sprays a pass from inside his own half that's taken down by Saka the good work from Kibbutz Kailia close quarters puts the tackle in on Saka we've only seen moments from Saka in this match he has another long pass from Rice this one out to the left hand side that's taken down by Martinelli Martinelli against Hakimi goes past him there was a foul I wasn't sure whether there was or not but Martinelli went crashing down and the free kick is given and it's a set piece for Arsenal in the full back position the PSG right back area and now Arsenal who've made so many set pieces count over the course of the last couple of seasons well they really need one here that's quite a soft foul as well I will say I mean Martinelli running at Hakimi he goes past knocks the ball tries to run around him there's a little bit of contact but not a lot Martinelli makes the most of it to win the foul and it's in a really threatening position this is big for Arsenal I mean they've got away with a couple of scares at the other end but Declan Rice just hovering over this ball and the problem for Donna Romer is he's going to just try and angle this free kick with pace so it just lands around that far post even so that it can just go in if no one touches it and there's going to be a load of Arsenal players just running across the face of it to make the goalkeepers life difficult well Declan Rice of course scored with two free kicks against Real Madrid here in the previous round now they need one of his specialist deliveries Declan Rice staring down this free kick in the full back position Rice comes up right foot it drives it in takes a double deflection then bounces away and it's cleared away volleyed away worked away by the left foot of Cabaret's Kailia and it bounces out of play and I make it we've got two minutes of the 90 to play Arsenal pressing trying to find this equaliser on the night throwing this taken over out of the far side Trossard works it back to all the way to the halfway line it goes to Declan Rice now back in position in the centre circle pulls it onto his right foot there's the long pass looking for Ben White but that's up and headed away by Nuno Mendes then Odegaard with a foot in Saka can't keep it in and it's a throw into PSG and another change coming up and it's going to be the midfielder the young French international another teenager Warren Sayah Emery who's going to come on and replace J'rao Neves who's had yet another good night in a PSG shirt yeah I mean it's a really good player as well to bring on at this stage in the game for PSG they've got such strength in depth another good energetic top quality young player changing positions for another and he's going to come on in that midfield with loads of energy and they need to see this game out I mean Lewis and Rique will have mixed feelings in a way because he's looking at those two chances John they must be thinking a little bit disappointed that they're not too nil up at least than taking that back to Puck de Prons and here is also Ethan Waneri for the final minutes of this match he's going to come on he's a new substitute wasn't he in both legs against Real Madrid so he wasn't able to to get under the pitch there but in their moment of need here and I'd say they really do need a goal one nil to go to Puck de Prons really would be a challenge for Arsenal even given what they did against Real Madrid in the previous round Raya long long ball downfield Saka's going to do well he jumps he heads it infield Nuno Mendes is underneath it to holly it away out of play on the halfway line and here we will see the change Nicolarteta all activity all energy comes forward slaps him on the back and on the bottom and he's going to take the place of the captain Matt yeah Odegaard off yeah well it's late stages of the game and I think Odegaard has quite the influence over this game that he would like to have I mean he's done some good things but it's been tough for him to get involved and get you know stamping his authority on this match it's been a little bit more about Declan Rice I have to say and probably Marino has been the busier two of the Arsenal midfield players so Miles Lewis-Skelly doesn't have that record for long as the youngest Englishman to play in a Champions League semi-final because that is now Ethan Waneri 18 last month and he's into the action well he's not daunted by anything is he nine goals this season and he takes up a position in the Arsenal midfield the number 53 Saka and Waneri on the field together ball played back to Marino long pass from him Lewis Enrique looking very concerned here as it's headed out of play by Hakimi throw in Lewis-Skelly is going to take this Marino finds a position on the edge of the box but he turns and he actually plays it back the throw in to Kivio and now all the way back to David Raya well five minutes of added time and we're already into that so time very much running out for Arsenal here is Waneri receiving the ball there out on the on the right flank and then going back to the halfway line and back into their own half Arsenal and indeed all the way back to David Raya the celebrations have already started for the PSG supporters although in saying that that's how they were just before the match started Saliba then forward towards Ben White Arsenal need to go forward but White has to check back put under pressure Raya then forced to go long because Gonzalo Ramos was closing him down then Saka jumps for it headed in field Fabian Ruiz was there to tidy it up and Donnaroma puts his foot through that and plonks it out of play inside the Arsenal half long thrill from Ben White he picked up a ball quickly off the corner there, Vettiniere was dispossessed on the edge of the area then a back yelp flick from Trossard now it's laid across and leaning back Martinelli sends his shot high over the top of the PSG cross barring into the Arsenal fans behind it in the north bank stand. Well I think it was Declan Rice that just saw an opportunity to get after the ball and he puts pressure on PSG I mean it's great anticipation for Rice he nicks in front of Vettiniere wins the ball it then gets towed back to Martinelli from Wanyeri and he just is a little bit ahead of it Martinelli so he can't really get a clean strike on it it's just off balance with the finish in the end. One nil in added time to Luis Enrique's French champions confirmed again the champions this season for a fourth year running the 11th time in 13 seasons dominant on the home front although they did lose on Friday night but they're winning here when it really really matters in the champions league Rice then don't white on the right hand side here is Wanyeri again Wanyeri beginning to drift in field Arsenal trying to find that moment in added time across it comes to Marinelli who lids it off a stretch from Wanyeri but the teenager is dispossessed and then Cavarra T'Calia loses out and it is taken away well by Declan Rice under under pressure there Rice is able to receive it back and then rolls the pass along the ground to Martinelli Martinelli against Hakimi takes him on round the outside Hakimi's able to go with Martinelli and then he plays it off and then wins the corner corner to Arsenal from the left we're in the fourth minute of added time match yeah it's clever from Martinelli actually it's not a lot there he's going down a dead end trying to run Hakimi on the outside and he just flicks it up against him to win the corner on purpose knowing that this is Arsenal's best opportunity to to get anything out of this game and Declan Rice just wanders over to the ball as they set it all up best opportunity perhaps last opportunity yes Rice walked across there all focus and concentration now he's ready referee's whistle goes Arsenal players lined up beyond the far post Rice with the delivery deep to the back post headed across but the referee blown his whistle he's seen something in there that he doesn't like Donoroma's on the ground he's saying that the PSG goalkeeper has been impeded he's been fouled and he's given a free kick to the visitors yeah I mean it was hard to tell the referee was very adamant went sprinting over to Donoroma to check that he's okay I think the Arsenal staff on the bench are getting a little bit of stick from the fourth official for coming out and wanting to speak to the referee is Ben White who just walks across Donoroma who does make the most of it I think Ben White does maybe engage the contact but it's not a lie it doesn't need to be a lot does it for at this stage for Parrish just to run the clock down that is it five minutes about a time of gone PSG have won the first leg Lewis Enrique looks very satisfied with his team's night's work slaps hands with his coaches Michael Arter is quickly across to Lewis Enrique the Champions League theme goes and with this scoreline the odds are now against Arsenal hearing this theme in Munich in the final next month PSG winning it with that very well work early goal Dembele the star he started it Kavara Tkeliac laid it back to him and he finished it brilliantly from the edge of the box and in off the post that in the fourth minute match and that was the end of the scoring yeah it was tough for Arsenal to to take that actually and it I think it shocked them and then put them on the back foot a little bit and PSG fully took control of that first half but there was a shift in the second half Arsenal came out more believe more physical got closer got tighter made life more difficult and I think you saw that they can still do damage in this tie Thomas party's coming back into that is going to be key but Arsenal not out of it yet disappointing result yes for sure they would wanted something out of this game but I think there's something there for them to hold on to that they can still go away from home and go through to the final so yes remember we saw Dona Romo super saves but Raya saves as well and Barca last chance and Gonzalo Ramos is dink against the crossbar Arsenal could have salvaged something but PSG could have won by more and their supporters in that corner it's all scarves up and as you said Matt they are very well capable of whipping up a brilliant atmosphere in the park to France next week that's what Arsenal are going to be up against and the full-time score in the first leg here Arsenal nil Paris Saint-Germain won and Kelly Keds is here with us John Murray and Matt Upton here at the Emirates and John mentioned the atmosphere in the park de France in the return leg of this fixture with the Paris fans are still celebrating over in the corner to our far right as the players make their way over there but they won't want to celebrate too soon because it is only one nil at the halfway stage of of this time we'll talk more between now and 10 30 Matt about what Arsenal can do in in Paris where do you think the damage was done tonight at the Emirates I think they just knocked the confidence a little bit that early goal and it was such a sharp fast start from PSG credit to them the way they were playing the build up to that goal there was a really inciting pass broke the lines from the centre back through into the midfield they were off fed wide and the directness the movement the power it was confident and I think it just rocked their belief a little bit for me and Arsenal hung on in there but PSG dominated a large part of that second half and looked the better team second half was it was a was a different game I thought Arsenal came back out realizing right we've got to get on top of this we've got to be more physical we've got the midfield we've got to get hold of the game better Declan Rice started to make those runs and created a couple of really good chances and it was a really well balanced second half I have to say Paris had their chances as John mentioned and then off the crossfire and what have you but so did Arsenal and I think it's quite nicely poised for a second leg in Paris did that sort of slightly calmer second half suit Arsenal more because if that first half felt frantic and frenetic and then it just seemed to be a little bit more grown up actually on both sides yeah I think PSG decided they're going to get the work done early and that that might have been the plan there might have been that you know we fast stuff that we start fast we go after him we're aggressive with our decision making we're going to press we're going to we feel like we're the superior outfit and and that's the mentality that they started the game with and over time it balanced out as you'd expect two really good teams I thought Arsenal got back into it and the midfield wasn't quite as on point as what it had been and we touched on it before and that missing player in Thomas party it is a big deal for Arsenal he will be back in that second leg perhaps that might really change the change the complex of how they play and is there an element as well of knowing what to expect from Paris though because I imagine they're going to want to go out and make a fast start again particularly when they're when they're at home but once you've been through that experience once are you more prepared the second time yes definitely and the experience of being away at Real Madrid certainly will help Arsenal in that atmosphere I think the atmosphere like John said will be more I think it'll be quite hostile it'll be loud it'll it'll have a real buzz around it and you'll have to you know overcome that and there will be rocky moments but I feel Arsenal if they can stay in the game they'll get stronger and stronger and build as the game goes on and you know we'll have to wait and see but it's not a disastrous result but like John said it is a tough one as PSG have I know they're not the favourites according to the octa-super computer which we all have to listen to that may be adjusted actually after this result might be tweaked but you're right Matt that the better at whipping up an atmosphere in the park de France than they are whipping up a decent sized sandwich a good spread maybe might not be there but you know what that's going to be at the forefront of every Arsenal fans mind who's listening to this is will John Murray get fed at the park de France the big concern I'll be all right Kelly don't worry I know you will be you make sure you make sure you will be John Murray and Matthew Upsham with us through till 10 30 will also be joined by Julian Laurent as we'll be reflecting on a 1-0 defeat for Arsenal at the Emirates Paris Saint-Germain with that goal from Dembele to make it 1-0 as they head to the park de France for the second leg of this Champions League semi-final lots more reaction to that elsewhere
