[0.00 - 8.60] P:1646.47 E:0.085160 |  ...shadow Messi and then Jordi Classie was given that option to try and nullify the little magician.
[8.60 - 9.80] P:1463.56 E:0.101849 |  But we're underway.
[11.20 - 15.00] P:1527.30 E:0.111468 |  The Dutch are playing from left to right, straight away.
[15.40 - 26.40] P:1410.32 E:0.107945 |  Our referee tonight, who is from Spain, Antonio Maseo giving a free kick in favour of Argentina.
[27.00 - 29.40] P:1481.98 E:0.116121 |  But the atmosphere is sensational, isn't it?
[30.00 - 40.40] P:1548.68 E:0.115183 |  Yep, the Argentinian fans at this World Cup really brought that, the noise and the passion into the stadiums.
[41.00 - 43.40] P:1397.49 E:0.117579 |  It was here again this evening in the loose sale.
[45.20 - 57.40] P:1605.78 E:0.098698 |  It was one of those when the Amphems actually took their headphones off just to try and listen to the 50,000 Argentinian supporters singing it with real emotion.
[58.40 - 70.40] P:1828.87 E:0.113407 |  And still the white and sky balloons, sky blue balloons are being bounded around and knocked around in that end away towards our right hand side.
[70.40 - 79.80] P:1778.43 E:0.104294 |  Little stumble from Arkay, sees it back towards his goalkeeper, Andreas Knopper, huge figure of a man all in green, 6'8".
[79.80 - 85.80] P:1513.94 E:0.097662 |  The keeper from Heron Bay, now at the back, it's with Ottenberg.
[87.40 - 95.80] P:1458.62 E:0.102864 |  Amazing story, isn't he? Knopper, really surprised pick in the Dutch squad, but he's had a pretty steady tournament so far.
[97.80 - 101.40] P:1625.73 E:0.097978 |  Hakunje, stocky, short, dark hair, left wing back.
[102.20 - 106.20] P:1430.00 E:0.106901 |  He was quite happy for Lisandro Martinez to try and come forward there, but at the minute,
[106.20 - 112.20] P:1463.67 E:0.105240 |  Martinez is just a normal to just stay here and then it's with Ottenberg across towards Christian Romero.
[113.00 - 115.20] P:1438.96 E:0.112425 |  This is Messi dropping deep.
[116.20 - 119.20] P:1612.15 E:0.114335 |  Brown certainly like that, as it's now with Romero.
[120.20 - 124.20] P:1703.40 E:0.107910 |  Ball played to McAllister.
[124.20 - 127.20] P:1722.55 E:0.107713 |  Chance to drive forward, Hakunje.
[128.20 - 135.20] P:1601.99 E:0.103619 |  With a cut back, getting forward on this near left hand side, and DeRome was there to clear it away for the Netherlands.
[135.20 - 136.20] P:1611.80 E:0.092355 |  0-0, two minutes play.
[136.20 - 144.20] P:1505.83 E:0.105423 |  I think it's fascinating that Argentina are set up and they're matching up against the Dutch.
[144.20 - 154.20] P:1533.32 E:0.105515 |  They've been 4-4-2 or 4-3-3 throughout this competition so far, shows their flexibility, but there's a show a bit of fear as well.
[154.20 - 155.20] P:1638.91 E:0.103762 |  Scoloni.
[156.20 - 164.20] P:1539.32 E:0.102127 |  Scoloni is the youngest head coach at this World Cup at 44 and he's up against Van Hal.
[165.20 - 171.20] P:1477.67 E:0.111998 |  The 71-year-old now in his third spell in charge of the Netherlands.
[172.20 - 180.20] P:1551.75 E:0.105414 |  I'm sure you're more than well aware that it was back in April when it was revealed he was having treatment for prostate cancer.
[181.20 - 185.20] P:1620.34 E:0.103154 |  There's a documentary that is going to be all about Van Hal.
[186.20 - 192.20] P:1728.84 E:0.100702 |  And even actually if you recall the final qualifier, he was in a wheelchair because he had actually broken his hip at that time.
[192.20 - 207.20] P:1681.25 E:0.100924 |  So he's certainly got a great deal of resilience and he's here in this quarter final and yet to lose in a World Cup game as well.
[207.20 - 216.20] P:1942.90 E:0.110785 |  Louis Van Hal, the master against the 44-year-old who has certainly revitalised his Argentinian side.
[216.20 - 220.20] P:1710.08 E:0.102455 |  But there is a clash of heads, Gakpo is down.
[221.20 - 224.20] P:1554.67 E:0.102060 |  The Spanish referee is just going to make sure he's okay.
[225.20 - 232.20] P:1453.86 E:0.095709 |  It's Enzo Fernandez and Gakpo just coming together.
[232.20 - 237.20] P:1535.63 E:0.115095 |  Both players nice focus firmly on the ball.
[238.20 - 239.20] P:1465.57 E:0.124224 |  It was okay.
[241.20 - 244.20] P:1609.27 E:0.114666 |  The referee is going to give an uncontested drop all here.
[244.20 - 248.20] P:1551.58 E:0.111108 |  I think he's just going to drop it for Ake and then Ake will hit it long downfield.
[250.20 - 252.20] P:1496.55 E:0.104311 |  Play back under way. Four minutes play.
[253.20 - 259.20] P:1515.97 E:0.092586 |  As it is he spreads it across the back. Timber goes back inside towards Van Dijk.
[259.20 - 263.20] P:1564.60 E:0.106883 |  It's pretty much all the Dutch have done in these opening exchanges. Pop the ball across the back.
[264.20 - 268.20] P:1677.19 E:0.102152 |  De Jong closely shadowed by De Paul, isn't he?
[270.20 - 275.20] P:1740.86 E:0.113845 |  Argentina get the ball and Messi charging forward out towards that right-hand side.
[275.20 - 281.20] P:1543.20 E:0.103676 |  The cross comes in. De Paul hits it. Strikes Alvarez and the Dutch threw it in.
[281.20 - 283.20] P:1613.69 E:0.098616 |  And then it's a little flick away.
[284.20 - 288.20] P:1711.18 E:0.116907 |  Certainly you could hear the excitement inside the Luceo Stadium when Messi picked it up.
[289.20 - 293.20] P:1686.85 E:0.114518 |  He popped it out to the right-hand side. Molina though wasn't a good cross.
[294.20 - 299.20] P:1452.94 E:0.104450 |  So Paul crossed from either side so far. The Argentinian wing backs.
[300.20 - 306.20] P:1467.38 E:0.102208 |  Molina is actually getting a little bit further up the field on that right-hand side.
[306.20 - 311.20] P:1667.12 E:0.108314 |  Can you stay quite tight on this near side the left?
[311.20 - 318.20] P:1470.94 E:0.087946 |  He's not wanting to venture too far forward but Molina, who plays for Atlético Madrid,
[318.20 - 323.20] P:1425.99 E:0.100528 |  was getting quite high and he had the covering presence of Topman's Christian Bramero.
[326.20 - 330.20] P:1587.64 E:0.099197 |  De Jong. Back it goes towards Van Dijk.
[332.20 - 335.20] P:1550.32 E:0.108843 |  This is the sixth World Cup meeting between the two.
[335.20 - 344.20] P:1621.69 E:0.098931 |  Only Brazil, Sweden and Argentina against Germany have played more often in the history of the World Cup with seven.
[345.20 - 351.20] P:1930.83 E:0.119321 |  So much history and recent meetings tend to be low-scoring affairs.
[353.20 - 356.20] P:1623.11 E:0.109436 |  It's a throw to Argentina on this near side the left.
[357.20 - 359.20] P:1487.02 E:0.093465 |  Cunha is going to take it.
[361.20 - 370.20] P:1590.43 E:0.096589 |  Go away from Enzo Fernandez. Cunha then takes the ball back to Alessandro Martinez.
[371.20 - 377.20] P:1411.10 E:0.095394 |  Here is the Manchester United player and he will switch play out towards Bramero.
[378.20 - 381.20] P:1510.62 E:0.086192 |  He's playing on the rise of the three. Forward ball.
[382.20 - 387.20] P:1668.88 E:0.100668 |  Looking to turn to try and get Molina forward on that right wing back roll.
[387.20 - 393.20] P:1710.92 E:0.098700 |  Acado tied his up and then very cruelly cleared by Nopper, the Dutch goalkeeper.
[393.20 - 397.20] P:1518.83 E:0.090848 |  De Rune stretching, bouncing ball, Messi knotted on.
[398.20 - 404.20] P:1479.57 E:0.096040 |  Looking to try and get it into the path of Molina but it's going to be picked up by Nopper.
[405.20 - 407.20] P:1681.83 E:0.122238 |  Seven minutes played, Neil Nielsen.
[407.20 - 411.20] P:1543.13 E:0.119402 |  We haven't seen Nielsen near enough from the Dutch attackers.
[413.20 - 418.20] P:1436.35 E:0.123262 |  De Pye playing up top with Burgwein, his preferred partner, Louis Van Halen.
[418.20 - 421.20] P:1628.76 E:0.113432 |  That hasn't always been the front line in this World Cup.
[421.20 - 424.20] P:1473.05 E:0.112161 |  And Aless chopped and changed with Gack Pochus.
[424.20 - 429.20] P:1558.94 E:0.110194 |  And that was drawn roll behind the front two but doesn't think he's had a touch yet.
[430.20 - 434.20] P:1669.05 E:0.101862 |  Here is Van Dijk coming forward. Central position of that back three.
[434.20 - 439.20] P:1637.49 E:0.091871 |  De Jong, tibetal figure of course. Frankie De Jong for the Dutch.
[439.20 - 445.20] P:1549.41 E:0.083039 |  Timber. And Fries is ahead of him. Touch there from Burgwein.
[445.20 - 449.20] P:1773.08 E:0.102660 |  The Rune able to turn the form of Middles for a player.
[449.20 - 453.20] P:1909.04 E:0.105313 |  He's outside the centre circle of his own half to Acke.
[453.20 - 455.20] P:1994.99 E:0.107888 |  A careful patient play this from the middle.
[455.20 - 459.20] P:1854.29 E:0.111807 |  Yes it is and that's another area where Van Halen's chopped and changed.
[459.20 - 463.20] P:1823.23 E:0.110005 |  That position alongside Frankie De Jong in the middle.
[463.20 - 467.20] P:1630.88 E:0.105284 |  Rune this evening has been Coopminers.
[467.20 - 468.20] P:1206.62 E:0.095993 |  Burgues.
[470.20 - 473.20] P:1606.43 E:0.106944 |  Yeah, Burgues played in the first game against Senegal.
[473.20 - 475.20] P:1644.75 E:0.111134 |  Coopminers came in.
[475.20 - 479.20] P:1620.69 E:0.109308 |  That was a almost mistake from the doctor.
[479.20 - 482.20] P:1517.17 E:0.100663 |  That was a no-no from Noppert.
[482.20 - 487.20] P:1373.57 E:0.111250 |  Just a little cushion past out to the right-hand side.
[487.20 - 491.20] P:1366.00 E:0.100435 |  But Alvar has nearly got onto that.
[492.20 - 496.20] P:1467.33 E:0.111718 |  Dumpfries on this right-hand side to Burgwein looking for the return ball to Dumpfries.
[496.20 - 499.20] P:1621.81 E:0.103838 |  Down towards the violin he goes, keeps the ball in play.
[499.20 - 503.20] P:1649.33 E:0.105956 |  And we'll win a throw down by the corner flag for the Dutch.
[503.20 - 507.20] P:1460.11 E:0.088638 |  We've been playing for just over eight minutes.
[508.20 - 514.20] P:1261.45 E:0.105951 |  Dumpfries with two assists and a goal against the United States.
[514.20 - 519.20] P:1717.15 E:0.107142 |  And the little ball played by Memphis Depaille towards Gatko
[519.20 - 521.20] P:1773.97 E:0.113205 |  goes out of play for a goal kick.
[521.20 - 526.20] P:1525.02 E:0.106801 |  I've got to say I've been really impressed with Denzil Dumpfries in this World Cup.
[527.20 - 532.20] P:1385.56 E:0.108283 |  It's like an Olympic 400 metre runner powering down that right-hand side.
[532.20 - 536.20] P:1679.09 E:0.109157 |  A couple of assists in the goal against the USA.
[536.20 - 542.20] P:1579.67 E:0.093641 |  Messi runs away from three orange shirts, passes the ball out towards Molina on that far side.
[542.20 - 545.20] P:1397.23 E:0.079418 |  Argentina now coming forward.
[545.20 - 548.20] P:1534.39 E:0.081129 |  This is Fernandez outside the centre-circle,
[548.20 - 551.20] P:1429.51 E:0.085759 |  cross to the near side, the left foot, Acunha.
[551.20 - 555.20] P:1432.67 E:0.103341 |  Acunha goes back to the centre of Martinez.
[555.20 - 557.20] P:1449.26 E:0.097799 |  And now to Ottimendi.
[557.20 - 564.20] P:1282.97 E:0.105859 |  They switch it across the three defenders, Romero, over the halfway line forward.
[564.20 - 568.20] P:1216.88 E:0.099681 |  A little bit of a touch there for Depaille.
[569.20 - 573.20] P:1254.16 E:0.102405 |  Back it goes out towards that right-hand side.
[573.20 - 577.20] P:1168.21 E:0.103334 |  Alvarez is just at the minute waiting in a central area.
[577.20 - 582.20] P:1268.97 E:0.092669 |  De Jong is keeping his eyes firmly fixed on Lionel Messi.
[583.20 - 588.20] P:1381.39 E:0.105494 |  Scoloni, the Argentinian coach out in that technical area down below.
[588.20 - 592.20] P:1518.46 E:0.095530 |  He wanted the ball played long there rather than across the back once more.
[592.20 - 598.20] P:1610.65 E:0.100629 |  The ball running forward to Molina, early cross, headed away by Van Dijk,
[598.20 - 602.20] P:1708.43 E:0.112352 |  off the chest by Messi, looking for a shooting opportunity, plays it to Acunha.
[602.20 - 605.20] P:1645.72 E:0.115254 |  And that was a wayward cut back from the left-hand side.
[605.20 - 608.20] P:1599.04 E:0.116086 |  It enters the penalty area, really pulled it away.
[608.20 - 611.20] P:1701.29 E:0.105345 |  He did the job for the Dutch, did Acunha inadvertently.
[611.20 - 613.20] P:1539.40 E:0.101433 |  Do you know what?
[613.20 - 615.20] P:1492.75 E:0.108283 |  I think I'm right.
[615.20 - 617.20] P:1365.59 E:0.120390 |  It was a couple of the game against Poland.
[617.20 - 620.20] P:1394.19 E:0.109176 |  He had an awful night.
[620.20 - 624.20] P:1565.10 E:0.110155 |  Final ball was woeful.
[624.20 - 627.20] P:1443.98 E:0.115296 |  He started poorly again, had a couple of...
[627.20 - 630.20] P:1349.04 E:0.108956 |  But in a really good couple of positions to cross the ball
[630.20 - 635.20] P:1357.56 E:0.104268 |  and hurt that Netherlands back line, but real lack of quality.
[637.20 - 640.20] P:1625.59 E:0.105956 |  Whilst Chris was talking again, it's one of those...
[640.20 - 644.20] P:1465.79 E:0.097761 |  I hope the atmosphere is coming home on the radio to you.
[644.20 - 647.20] P:1556.36 E:0.097471 |  The level of support here.
[650.20 - 652.20] P:1811.16 E:0.118925 |  50,000, it's staggering.
[652.20 - 659.20] P:1619.02 E:0.103364 |  It is, and we were here early and watching the Brazilian Croatia penalty shoot out
[659.20 - 664.20] P:1389.33 E:0.110464 |  and there was a number of Argentinian fans who were in the stadium earlier.
[664.20 - 667.20] P:1388.85 E:0.101240 |  Quite enjoyed Brazil going out.
[667.20 - 674.20] P:1374.15 E:0.099965 |  Yes, Croatia await after Brazil, missed two penalties
[674.20 - 677.20] P:1469.48 E:0.088853 |  and losing their quarter-final.
[677.20 - 681.20] P:1544.58 E:0.088297 |  It'll be the first semi-final, actually here in the city of Luzal,
[681.20 - 685.20] P:1465.82 E:0.087440 |  which is about nine miles north of Doha.
[685.20 - 688.20] P:1364.37 E:0.105698 |  It's a bit unsporting, wasn't it?
[690.20 - 693.20] P:1686.28 E:0.115058 |  Well, they're not concentrating about Brazil now, are they?
[693.20 - 696.20] P:1554.62 E:0.119213 |  Just bouncing up and down in unison.
[696.20 - 698.20] P:1490.25 E:0.103739 |  The stadium is jumping.
[700.20 - 701.20] P:1508.84 E:0.114436 |  0-0.
[701.20 - 705.20] P:1555.81 E:0.113965 |  It feels like a proper football match, doesn't it?
[705.20 - 709.20] P:1601.85 E:0.093120 |  We've seen a few Mexican waves at various games, which...
[709.20 - 713.20] P:1606.11 E:0.105783 |  It's a fair to say, in a little bit forced a bit.
[713.20 - 717.20] P:1831.26 E:0.101204 |  A bit corporate. Real fans tonight.
[717.20 - 720.20] P:1665.10 E:0.076767 |  Proper atmosphere. 12 minutes play.
[720.20 - 723.20] P:1645.92 E:0.095379 |  Of course, tomorrow, Morocco, Portugal at three o'clock
[723.20 - 725.20] P:1706.81 E:0.079139 |  and then England, France at seven.
[725.20 - 727.20] P:1495.67 E:0.104407 |  All the build-up from 5.30.
[727.20 - 730.20] P:1607.90 E:0.093837 |  Of course, five-life sport on air from mid-day,
[730.20 - 734.20] P:1638.86 E:0.094357 |  but the concentrated build-up at half-pass five from Marc Chapman
[734.20 - 738.20] P:1528.33 E:0.091553 |  and the team inside the stadium, the Albatte Stadium.
[738.20 - 742.20] P:1648.81 E:0.102887 |  But this is Devlin's nil, Argentina nil.
[743.20 - 747.20] P:1526.18 E:0.100715 |  And Ottomendi goes out towards the right-hand side.
[747.20 - 752.20] P:1451.55 E:0.094843 |  This tight, cagey affair is exactly everything that I thought it would be.
[752.20 - 754.20] P:1512.05 E:0.104505 |  McAllister in the centre-circle.
[754.20 - 757.20] P:1634.30 E:0.096174 |  Out to Acunha on this near-side, the left.
[757.20 - 759.20] P:1467.15 E:0.107903 |  Acunha looking for the return ball.
[759.20 - 764.20] P:1661.38 E:0.101408 |  McAllister controls it and then sends over the cross from the left-hand side,
[764.20 - 767.20] P:1444.44 E:0.100719 |  picked up by De Paul, right corner of the area,
[767.20 - 770.20] P:1656.77 E:0.104828 |  and then it's just caught with ease by Noffert and the goalkeeper.
[770.20 - 772.20] P:1669.52 E:0.119274 |  It's a really good run.
[772.20 - 775.20] P:1709.17 E:0.088057 |  The left-hand channel by McAllister.
[775.20 - 778.20] P:1620.20 E:0.104531 |  One touch in across the ball, but...
[778.20 - 781.20] P:1800.45 E:0.122765 |  That's a strong challenge, there.
[781.20 - 785.20] P:1869.72 E:0.115116 |  That was Christian Romero going in,
[785.20 - 789.20] P:1930.99 E:0.110125 |  and the Spanish referee calls him to him
[789.20 - 793.20] P:1818.59 E:0.099519 |  and takes him away from everybody else for the Tottenham player.
[793.20 - 795.20] P:1704.71 E:0.113297 |  Oh, he does get the ball back.
[795.20 - 797.20] P:1696.16 E:0.086809 |  He does an half-take.
[797.20 - 801.20] P:1670.52 E:0.104665 |  A piece of the pipe at Argentinian back three.
[801.20 - 805.20] P:1610.44 E:0.095043 |  Romero, Ottomendi, Martinez, rough and rugged.
[805.20 - 807.20] P:1573.40 E:0.082119 |  Street fighters.
[808.20 - 810.20] P:1793.03 E:0.109639 |  Free kick for the Netherlands.
[810.20 - 812.20] P:1768.69 E:0.078371 |  De Jong is going to take it.
[813.20 - 816.20] P:1511.37 E:0.118627 |  Messi was actually having a word with the Spanish referee.
[816.20 - 819.20] P:1586.64 E:0.101135 |  He's still not happy from where he's going to be taken.
[819.20 - 821.20] P:1337.47 E:0.098150 |  It's just outside the centre-circle,
[821.20 - 824.20] P:1438.17 E:0.086250 |  and De Rón gives it back to De Jong.
[824.20 - 826.20] P:1295.52 E:0.105859 |  Blonde-haired midfielder.
[828.20 - 830.20] P:1532.99 E:0.101975 |  Back now with Acunha.
[830.20 - 832.20] P:1513.92 E:0.105812 |  Left to the centre-circle.
[832.20 - 835.20] P:1620.78 E:0.103165 |  Timber just inside the Dutch half.
[835.20 - 838.20] P:1494.32 E:0.095773 |  Van Dijk waiting for it.
[838.20 - 841.20] P:1461.82 E:0.098252 |  Is Blintover on that far side.
[841.20 - 843.20] P:1340.04 E:0.102229 |  Passes the ball forward.
[843.20 - 845.20] P:1555.66 E:0.089292 |  Move-al break down.
[845.20 - 847.20] P:1607.42 E:0.099973 |  The pie will try and chase after it,
[847.20 - 850.20] P:1581.32 E:0.093672 |  but Argentina have comfortably seen it back to their goalkeeper,
[850.20 - 852.20] P:1460.29 E:0.095692 |  Emi Martinez.
[852.20 - 857.20] P:1617.99 E:0.093960 |  That crucial save late on against Australia in that frantic finish.
[857.20 - 860.20] P:1350.87 E:0.103670 |  There he did. A big moment for Argentina.
[860.20 - 863.20] P:1326.96 E:0.111617 |  Similar to the Dutch, he found a way.
[863.20 - 867.20] P:1505.82 E:0.108230 |  We haven't seen any of the Dutch centre-half step in at all
[867.20 - 869.20] P:1361.80 E:0.108409 |  at this moment in time.
[869.20 - 872.20] P:1481.52 E:0.103294 |  When they're in possession,
[872.20 - 874.20] P:1448.67 E:0.105458 |  they're a 3v2.
[874.20 - 877.20] P:1432.00 E:0.096620 |  Just keeping their shape.
[878.20 - 881.20] P:1458.56 E:0.103787 |  Diagonal ball hit forward for the runner Valveres.
[881.20 - 884.20] P:1606.47 E:0.105508 |  When we said before, though, about when they met in 2014,
[884.20 - 888.20] P:1632.12 E:0.103253 |  and it was the semi-final in South power,
[888.20 - 895.20] P:1682.67 E:0.110814 |  they were a little bit more on penalties in Brazil eight years ago.
[895.20 - 898.20] P:1547.66 E:0.085438 |  We said about them shadowing Messi,
[898.20 - 901.20] P:1364.29 E:0.094570 |  that Van Halen this occasion doesn't appear
[901.20 - 903.20] P:1632.69 E:0.106964 |  to have gone for a man-marking job on it,
[903.20 - 907.20] P:1662.29 E:0.109593 |  as Timber comes forward and it's inside to Gatpo.
[909.20 - 913.20] P:1829.05 E:0.110772 |  Vergwein out towards Memphis to pie with the cross.
[913.20 - 916.20] P:1704.48 E:0.112058 |  Dumfries at the far post, lifted back into the danger area.
[916.20 - 919.20] P:1611.66 E:0.107796 |  Blink was there. He goes down under a challenge.
[919.20 - 922.20] P:1746.44 E:0.103007 |  Argentina get it away towards Fernandez.
[922.20 - 925.20] P:1733.45 E:0.107898 |  Still they'll nail first real sign that the Netherlands
[925.20 - 928.20] P:1710.82 E:0.101542 |  took them to kind of cause Argentina some problems.
[928.20 - 932.20] P:1545.72 E:0.105256 |  Yeah, but this has been the Netherlands at this World Cup, hasn't it?
[932.20 - 937.20] P:1475.05 E:0.103589 |  Those moments where they just counter, where they pounce.
[938.20 - 942.20] P:1418.11 E:0.113102 |  Dumfries, sort of terrific World Cup there.
[942.20 - 946.20] P:1452.12 E:0.106298 |  Being that threat as the ball fed to the far post,
[946.20 - 949.20] P:1573.89 E:0.101335 |  a little right foot cushioned volley.
[949.20 - 952.20] P:1534.42 E:0.111759 |  And daily Blink, they linked up for a goal against USA, didn't they?
[952.20 - 953.20] P:1439.97 E:0.099417 |  Yes they did.
[953.20 - 956.20] P:1205.07 E:0.096261 |  He wasn't far away, got up in the ball,
[957.20 - 960.20] P:1276.10 E:0.103532 |  and just over his head at the far post.
[961.20 - 963.20] P:1547.75 E:0.115329 |  The crease on that a night.
[963.20 - 966.20] P:1633.14 E:0.109221 |  Obviously, it was off his weaker foot, actually, for daily Blink.
[966.20 - 968.20] P:1548.46 E:0.110954 |  Swept it in off his right foot,
[968.20 - 971.20] P:1418.40 E:0.112976 |  but sort of on crease when he was at PSV.
[971.20 - 974.20] P:1459.80 E:0.110709 |  And even whether he's a right back, right wing back,
[974.20 - 977.20] P:1479.85 E:0.109870 |  he just likes to get forward, very attack minded.
[977.20 - 979.20] P:1503.85 E:0.108449 |  But this system certainly suits him.
[981.20 - 983.20] P:1629.87 E:0.121610 |  To do exactly what he does,
[983.20 - 986.20] P:1555.20 E:0.112285 |  and he's playing so high on this near side at the moment.
[986.20 - 988.20] P:1691.16 E:0.108852 |  He's taking a cuneque back with it,
[988.20 - 990.20] P:1662.37 E:0.113686 |  as Argentina try and win the ball in the midfield.
[990.20 - 992.20] P:1798.50 E:0.114542 |  De Jong slides into a challenge.
[992.20 - 996.20] P:1739.20 E:0.108849 |  It's a good 50-50 between De Jong and Los Andro Martinez.
[996.20 - 999.20] P:1629.85 E:0.110767 |  He's a little fireball, isn't he?
[999.20 - 1001.20] P:1320.95 E:0.106376 |  Good hold back then.
[1003.20 - 1006.20] P:1609.20 E:0.107589 |  Two former Ajax players, of course.
[1006.20 - 1009.20] P:1502.45 E:0.104335 |  Martinez, the Ajax player of the year.
[1010.20 - 1012.20] P:1393.82 E:0.117635 |  Last year, 17 minutes play.
[1013.20 - 1015.20] P:1699.12 E:0.111825 |  Last season, should I say.
[1015.20 - 1017.20] P:1640.07 E:0.105530 |  There's Van Dijk.
[1017.20 - 1020.20] P:1386.98 E:0.110805 |  Members to play on the halfway line.
[1020.20 - 1021.20] P:1408.60 E:0.091255 |  Runs it.
[1021.20 - 1025.20] P:1291.28 E:0.100708 |  Almost hands it over to Blink, inside to De Jong.
[1025.20 - 1027.20] P:1365.76 E:0.095293 |  Coming in the pressure from the ball.
[1027.20 - 1029.20] P:1547.18 E:0.097404 |  Helped out by De Jong.
[1029.20 - 1031.20] P:1673.53 E:0.090103 |  Back with Van Dijk.
[1031.20 - 1033.20] P:1739.49 E:0.111037 |  Nice gentle walking pace from the duck.
[1034.20 - 1037.20] P:1670.86 E:0.116599 |  Timber over the halfway line, looking for the run of Bergwein.
[1038.20 - 1040.20] P:1722.17 E:0.119597 |  Good anticipation from Neymar,
[1040.20 - 1042.20] P:1747.39 E:0.116271 |  Martinez the goalkeeper, all in red.
[1042.20 - 1044.20] P:1807.10 E:0.109132 |  Accelerated off his line, made the smothering save.
[1044.20 - 1046.20] P:1667.12 E:0.096740 |  Yep, and that's the first time really,
[1046.20 - 1048.20] P:1442.04 E:0.111252 |  we've seen one of the three duchess end to half,
[1048.20 - 1050.20] P:1554.44 E:0.114745 |  step in in that right-hand channel.
[1050.20 - 1053.20] P:1212.42 E:0.092704 |  Timber slides a ball in.
[1054.20 - 1056.20] P:1451.65 E:0.105835 |  Bergwein with a run. Not far away.
[1057.20 - 1059.20] P:1598.00 E:0.095226 |  Good goalkeeping from Martinez.
[1059.20 - 1062.20] P:1664.83 E:0.110749 |  Alvarez tries to get away from the challenge of De Jong.
[1062.20 - 1065.20] P:1570.39 E:0.094631 |  He then runs it to Timber and De Jong.
[1065.20 - 1067.20] P:1517.26 E:0.113265 |  He's pushing the back from Alvarez.
[1067.20 - 1069.20] P:1307.35 E:0.077740 |  De Jong.
[1069.20 - 1071.20] P:1506.87 E:0.099046 |  He went through his own half.
[1071.20 - 1073.20] P:1482.89 E:0.097957 |  He'll go back to Van Dijk.
[1073.20 - 1076.20] P:1527.15 E:0.095407 |  And now to Acke.
[1076.20 - 1078.20] P:1379.91 E:0.097642 |  Acke and Anakke.
[1078.20 - 1080.20] P:1644.28 E:0.089753 |  Both of them.
[1080.20 - 1083.20] P:1585.62 E:0.106524 |  Five starts now in this competition.
[1084.20 - 1088.20] P:1378.66 E:0.112014 |  Just tweaked it every now and again as Van Hal with that back line.
[1088.20 - 1092.20] P:1533.35 E:0.109089 |  Acke certainly benefiting from the switch to three,
[1092.20 - 1094.20] P:1551.71 E:0.108555 |  the Manchester City player.
[1094.20 - 1097.20] P:1271.91 E:0.104348 |  Stayed high out on that far side of the left.
[1097.20 - 1099.20] P:1308.42 E:0.090960 |  Now they work it back inside towards De Jong.
[1099.20 - 1102.20] P:1560.48 E:0.101680 |  Messi though is doing the chasing.
[1102.20 - 1104.20] P:1487.56 E:0.085100 |  Blint forward to Pylots.
[1104.20 - 1107.20] P:1557.41 E:0.109524 |  It runs through, bounces away off the knees of Romero.
[1107.20 - 1110.20] P:1596.49 E:0.094123 |  Comes towards De Jong, clips it across to Timber,
[1110.20 - 1113.20] P:1536.69 E:0.099495 |  takes it off the chest, over the halfway line.
[1113.20 - 1117.20] P:1614.88 E:0.109833 |  And it's still goalless here on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.
[1117.20 - 1120.20] P:1701.26 E:0.111561 |  As Bergwein, the referee gives a free kick.
[1120.20 - 1123.20] P:1870.90 E:0.120187 |  It was for a challenge to Fries on Acke.
[1123.20 - 1125.20] P:1784.48 E:0.118490 |  I think that that's harsh.
[1125.20 - 1128.20] P:1602.95 E:0.124099 |  Fries saying, come on, what did I do, Rom?
[1128.20 - 1131.20] P:1596.15 E:0.107326 |  The junior actually puts his arm across him and stops him.
[1131.20 - 1135.20] P:1648.18 E:0.113894 |  Fries trying to play a little give and go.
[1135.20 - 1138.20] P:1811.72 E:0.114250 |  One, two, with Bergwein.
[1140.20 - 1144.20] P:1623.40 E:0.116067 |  The way these two teams set up with the wing backs,
[1144.20 - 1147.20] P:1624.23 E:0.099989 |  those jewels in the wide areas.
[1147.20 - 1150.20] P:1616.44 E:0.098135 |  From the Bresa and the Cunha,
[1150.20 - 1152.20] P:1407.72 E:0.100473 |  Lina and Blint,
[1152.20 - 1156.20] P:1427.86 E:0.096978 |  they're going to play a big part, have a big bearing on this game.
[1156.20 - 1160.20] P:1502.99 E:0.107739 |  Whilst you were talking there, Chris, did you notice that the Spanish referee,
[1160.20 - 1164.20] P:1542.22 E:0.105823 |  Antonio Matiu, had a word with Di Maria?
[1164.20 - 1166.20] P:1598.90 E:0.111170 |  Clearly Di Maria have said something out of turn
[1166.20 - 1169.20] P:1663.38 E:0.102841 |  on the substitutes bench for Argentina.
[1169.20 - 1173.20] P:1598.86 E:0.111350 |  And the one thing when I've seen this Spanish referee in Champions League games,
[1173.20 - 1176.20] P:1617.27 E:0.105772 |  he takes no nonsense.
[1176.20 - 1179.20] P:1586.26 E:0.113561 |  Something might say a fishes.
[1179.20 - 1183.20] P:1571.69 E:0.107001 |  He certainly, and I thought he calls the players,
[1183.20 - 1186.20] P:1623.51 E:0.100511 |  he says to the players, you come here.
[1186.20 - 1191.20] P:1625.89 E:0.108368 |  You're in left and low in certain terms, who's in charge?
[1191.20 - 1193.20] P:1661.25 E:0.105999 |  It's like working with your good self.
[1193.20 - 1195.20] P:1411.41 E:0.107010 |  Yeah, I don't mind that.
[1195.20 - 1199.20] P:1401.32 E:0.095205 |  Bit of authority, no where you stand.
[1199.20 - 1202.20] P:1551.20 E:0.109360 |  20 minutes played.
[1202.20 - 1207.20] P:1530.05 E:0.115047 |  Yet to have a serious chance on goal from either side.
[1207.20 - 1209.20] P:1623.66 E:0.115401 |  OK, listen forward, De Pye makes the run.
[1209.20 - 1211.20] P:1664.51 E:0.102027 |  Ottenendis gone with him into the penalty area,
[1211.20 - 1213.20] P:1676.30 E:0.113672 |  holding him, not allowing him to turn.
[1213.20 - 1216.20] P:1770.80 E:0.116286 |  And then when De Pye just tried to roll in,
[1216.20 - 1218.20] P:1766.80 E:0.115066 |  Ottenendis gets the right foot in and it goes behind,
[1218.20 - 1220.20] P:1676.71 E:0.107080 |  and out for a quarter kick.
[1220.20 - 1223.20] P:1623.30 E:0.117448 |  There's a good run from De Pye in that left-hand channel.
[1223.20 - 1227.20] P:1728.37 E:0.116315 |  And he backs into Ottenendis, used his body well.
[1227.20 - 1234.20] P:1835.75 E:0.119091 |  Tried to roll in, but Ottenendis getting a big toe to the ball.
[1234.20 - 1237.20] P:1882.78 E:0.115441 |  The whistles and the cheers,
[1237.20 - 1243.20] P:1784.59 E:0.106898 |  because it's a Dutch corner kick, which is taken short.
[1243.20 - 1246.20] P:1659.64 E:0.108871 |  From the left-hand side, headed out,
[1246.20 - 1250.20] P:1622.51 E:0.107373 |  and then De Jong will look to try and head it out towards that far side.
[1250.20 - 1253.20] P:1565.38 E:0.102814 |  Gakpo prongs it forward, little touch there by De Pye.
[1253.20 - 1255.20] P:1658.62 E:0.107296 |  Ake tries to return the ball to him,
[1255.20 - 1258.20] P:1745.61 E:0.110303 |  and then it's brought away by Molina.
[1258.20 - 1261.20] P:1738.21 E:0.109719 |  Molina trying to get forward on that right-hand side,
[1261.20 - 1264.20] P:1830.18 E:0.114165 |  and the Argentinian support.
[1264.20 - 1268.20] P:1614.05 E:0.105426 |  Although, did you hear a little chant of Holland Holland
[1268.20 - 1271.20] P:1470.76 E:0.096919 |  of the effects bike?
[1271.20 - 1273.20] P:1422.36 E:0.114445 |  No.
[1273.20 - 1278.20] P:1538.46 E:0.101277 |  For the first time tonight, I actually heard Dutch voices.
[1278.20 - 1280.20] P:1646.67 E:0.117460 |  All-place forward.
[1280.20 - 1284.20] P:1575.34 E:0.107322 |  Alvarez makes the run, and Dike manages to get it away.
[1284.20 - 1286.20] P:1669.43 E:0.109856 |  Out of the way, Ake.
[1286.20 - 1288.20] P:1701.65 E:0.117872 |  Out of the go for a throw to Argentina, Lilnith.
[1288.20 - 1292.20] P:1578.44 E:0.106282 |  Alvarez will do that when there's space in behind.
[1292.20 - 1295.20] P:1405.53 E:0.109665 |  He'll make those runs in behind the Dutch backs, Ray.
[1295.20 - 1298.20] P:1341.59 E:0.101890 |  But Dike took an unnecessary risk there.
[1298.20 - 1300.20] P:1662.68 E:0.116607 |  Messi, brilliant put-work.
[1300.20 - 1303.20] P:1629.77 E:0.113548 |  Messi with a shot, and left foot, it couldn't keep it down.
[1304.20 - 1307.20] P:1672.36 E:0.124448 |  Under a full moon in La Salle,
[1307.20 - 1311.20] P:1538.50 E:0.116865 |  Lionel Messi just couldn't quite find the range,
[1311.20 - 1314.20] P:1646.51 E:0.114974 |  and it was no danger to Nopper.
[1314.20 - 1317.20] P:1519.63 E:0.112655 |  Really good feet from Messi, though.
[1317.20 - 1320.20] P:1591.01 E:0.113560 |  Drifts through the Dutch midfield, 25 yards out,
[1320.20 - 1324.20] P:1619.95 E:0.115624 |  tries to bend the ball into that far corner, far top corner.
[1324.20 - 1328.20] P:1680.75 E:0.101223 |  We're approaching the midway point in the first half.
[1328.20 - 1331.20] P:1613.95 E:0.107090 |  Here on BBC Radio 5,
[1331.20 - 1334.20] P:1693.99 E:0.095491 |  Durón finds De Jong.
[1334.20 - 1338.20] P:1688.57 E:0.100781 |  It's an elegant midfielder, up to Gatpo.
[1338.20 - 1341.20] P:1563.11 E:0.114222 |  Clear, lifted that away by Fernandez
[1341.20 - 1343.20] P:1643.06 E:0.091409 |  in the midfield for Argentina.
[1343.20 - 1345.20] P:1495.96 E:0.103157 |  Blint.
[1345.20 - 1348.20] P:1386.19 E:0.104151 |  De Jong will make sure that he got there before Messi,
[1348.20 - 1351.20] P:1508.83 E:0.112761 |  and now Nopper, all in green, comes out of his goal.
[1351.20 - 1354.20] P:1562.46 E:0.113407 |  He plays a short forward ball towards Van Dijk.
[1354.20 - 1356.20] P:1746.69 E:0.114503 |  They don't.
[1356.20 - 1359.20] P:1841.49 E:0.111331 |  Black passion is Argentina's support,
[1359.20 - 1362.20] P:1613.08 E:0.122348 |  and they certainly have an abundance of energy.
[1362.20 - 1366.20] P:1743.64 E:0.121105 |  As once again, the arms are being thrust into the air,
[1366.20 - 1369.20] P:1582.86 E:0.116507 |  jumping up and down,
[1369.20 - 1373.20] P:1613.09 E:0.118205 |  and certainly creating a wonderful noise.
[1373.20 - 1376.20] P:1477.39 E:0.117701 |  De Fries couldn't get on the end of it.
[1376.20 - 1380.20] P:1769.58 E:0.120845 |  It will be an Argentina throw on this near side, as Argentina
[1380.20 - 1383.20] P:1978.63 E:0.124005 |  is now in the lead.
[1383.20 - 1386.20] P:1837.37 E:0.118832 |  Argentina throw on this near side, as Argentina
[1386.20 - 1389.20] P:1521.39 E:0.097045 |  played from right to left.
[1392.20 - 1396.20] P:1325.38 E:0.099593 |  They continue to take it, not much movement for it.
[1398.20 - 1402.20] P:1350.21 E:0.107084 |  Hardly any movement whatsoever at all down there.
[1402.20 - 1405.20] P:1480.11 E:0.105426 |  The referee surely going to have to tell it to hurry up.
[1405.20 - 1409.20] P:1517.64 E:0.096505 |  Eventually it's taken, and it comes back to a severe player,
[1409.20 - 1412.20] P:1531.26 E:0.101329 |  but then they lose the ball, and it's with Van Dijk.
[1412.20 - 1415.20] P:1593.35 E:0.095903 |  There is a lot of respect between the two, isn't there?
[1415.20 - 1417.20] P:1612.39 E:0.088943 |  Yep.
[1417.20 - 1423.20] P:1433.96 E:0.106049 |  Absolutely, and Argentina don't have that big physical presence up top.
[1423.20 - 1427.20] P:1690.75 E:0.114920 |  Defy to Burgwein, comes back towards Burgwein,
[1427.20 - 1429.20] P:1763.28 E:0.115725 |  and he's practically shot wide.
[1429.20 - 1433.20] P:1715.01 E:0.114795 |  Little bit fortuitous how it came to him at the second time of asking,
[1433.20 - 1437.20] P:1520.46 E:0.106740 |  but it was well off top.
[1437.20 - 1440.20] P:1477.29 E:0.110123 |  Good signs though, to the Dutch.
[1440.20 - 1444.20] P:1579.20 E:0.111333 |  Front to linking up, they like to play together.
[1444.20 - 1447.20] P:1493.96 E:0.112596 |  The guy's favourite partner, Burgwein.
[1447.20 - 1450.20] P:1481.88 E:0.116342 |  Burgwein pops a little ball in too many.
[1450.20 - 1454.20] P:1422.14 E:0.113661 |  Outsiders right foot, boot, plays it round the corner,
[1454.20 - 1457.20] P:1568.01 E:0.111633 |  it's lifted, and it's a poor effort in fact.
[1457.20 - 1461.20] P:1488.99 E:0.107156 |  20 yards out, left footed, pulls it wide.
[1462.20 - 1465.20] P:1712.79 E:0.116860 |  Fanching before about that semi-final in Sao Paulo,
[1465.20 - 1469.20] P:1800.70 E:0.114768 |  that finished goalless in Argentina, prevailing 4-2.
[1469.20 - 1475.20] P:1672.52 E:0.114964 |  That was the second semi-final, 24 hours after Brazil were humiliated
[1475.20 - 1478.20] P:1497.19 E:0.108755 |  in Belo Horizonte by Germany.
[1478.20 - 1483.20] P:1607.75 E:0.111258 |  Brazil are out, they've lost on penalties themselves tonight.
[1483.20 - 1486.20] P:1676.26 E:0.118636 |  But the long history between these two nations,
[1486.20 - 1491.20] P:1707.36 E:0.116216 |  they also played 2006 in the group stage in Frankfurt,
[1491.20 - 1493.20] P:1860.06 E:0.116597 |  and it was 0-0.
[1493.20 - 1496.20] P:1639.65 E:0.118963 |  Three goals in the last four games.
[1496.20 - 1500.20] P:1550.47 E:0.118771 |  Just imagine if Argentina scored.
[1500.20 - 1503.20] P:1514.46 E:0.114989 |  It's like they said 0-0.
[1503.20 - 1505.20] P:1657.30 E:0.122972 |  If you've walked into the stadium now,
[1505.20 - 1508.20] P:1621.58 E:0.112886 |  you could be forgiven for thinking that they had scored,
[1508.20 - 1515.20] P:1449.91 E:0.112562 |  judging by the noise and the actions of this vast Argentinian support.
[1515.20 - 1519.20] P:1480.27 E:0.101495 |  They're on the attack now, de Paul.
[1519.20 - 1521.20] P:1647.54 E:0.101879 |  Laid off by McAllister.
[1521.20 - 1523.20] P:1627.39 E:0.102959 |  Alvarez keeps it alive, Acunha,
[1523.20 - 1526.20] P:1580.06 E:0.113743 |  and Alvarez run into each other, and it breaks down,
[1526.20 - 1528.20] P:1602.65 E:0.114031 |  and Alvarez goes for a throw.
[1528.20 - 1530.20] P:1625.56 E:0.103656 |  That was a good challenge.
[1530.20 - 1532.20] P:1497.85 E:0.099364 |  Timber.
[1534.20 - 1539.20] P:1489.24 E:0.110862 |  Right-sided, centre-back, all the Netherlands on Alvarez.
[1539.20 - 1541.20] P:1576.01 E:0.109261 |  Time to perfection.
[1542.20 - 1545.20] P:1571.96 E:0.113169 |  I wouldn't say calling Mystic Meg,
[1545.20 - 1548.20] P:1657.02 E:0.118382 |  but the other day I was messaging our editor,
[1548.20 - 1554.20] P:1647.72 E:0.119731 |  and I said Spain are going to lose this on penalties.
[1554.20 - 1557.20] P:1659.06 E:0.116081 |  And then I was making a prediction about this game,
[1557.20 - 1562.20] P:1737.79 E:0.120715 |  saying this will go the whole hog as well.
[1562.20 - 1567.20] P:1657.74 E:0.120407 |  And I've seen nothing in the opening 26 minutes to suggest otherwise.
[1567.20 - 1570.20] P:1512.63 E:0.119881 |  Yeah, right, you know, I get that,
[1570.20 - 1578.20] P:1495.94 E:0.106891 |  but has this sort of opening 25-26 minutes
[1578.20 - 1581.20] P:1606.78 E:0.105234 |  epitomised both teams in this tournament,
[1581.20 - 1584.20] P:1580.81 E:0.112073 |  but then there are those moments,
[1584.20 - 1586.20] P:1606.08 E:0.112920 |  the messy moment against Mexico.
[1586.20 - 1588.20] P:1696.82 E:0.100816 |  Enzo Fernandez,
[1588.20 - 1591.20] P:1582.33 E:0.103519 |  who saw the Dutch total football goal, didn't we?
[1591.20 - 1595.20] P:1627.22 E:0.105861 |  One under the pitch to the other against the USA.
[1595.20 - 1600.20] P:1696.73 E:0.104588 |  If it does come off, I think I might put the lottery numbers on
[1600.20 - 1603.20] P:1810.55 E:0.119522 |  for the weekend. I don't tend to do the lottery at the moment.
[1603.20 - 1608.20] P:1490.26 E:0.112947 |  Looking to hit the jackpot for Argentina at this World Cup,
[1608.20 - 1616.20] P:1564.21 E:0.095057 |  and certainly little messy hoping that this year will be his year.
[1616.20 - 1620.20] P:1576.63 E:0.106831 |  Tonight he's making his 24 World Cup appearances,
[1620.20 - 1623.20] P:1600.85 E:0.098432 |  level with Miroslav closer.
[1623.20 - 1628.20] P:1512.52 E:0.103200 |  So only now Lota Mateus has actually played more World Cup games
[1628.20 - 1631.20] P:1676.11 E:0.117871 |  than Lilo Messi.
[1631.20 - 1636.20] P:1575.40 E:0.102653 |  Stupid challenge from the Gank Pope.
[1636.20 - 1641.20] P:1503.40 E:0.097670 |  Not to mend a long ball from Nathan Ackie
[1641.20 - 1644.20] P:1479.65 E:0.104934 |  in behind the Argentine-Potinian backline,
[1644.20 - 1649.20] P:1427.70 E:0.099231 |  and he just pushes him over.
[1649.20 - 1652.20] P:1591.72 E:0.092118 |  Half-challenge.
[1652.20 - 1655.20] P:1577.74 E:0.115363 |  You're listening to Five Live. That's Chris Sutton.
[1655.20 - 1661.20] P:1708.09 E:0.117151 |  As Emi Martinez has pulled his clearance out to this near side there left,
[1661.20 - 1664.20] P:1403.72 E:0.110825 |  playing from right to left, approaching the half-hour.
[1664.20 - 1667.20] P:1391.60 E:0.100061 |  So Tom Fries to take the throw.
[1667.20 - 1673.20] P:1443.87 E:0.105944 |  He's been told to go back by the referee to timber on the halfway line.
[1673.20 - 1676.20] P:1406.71 E:0.101682 |  Now with Van Dijk.
[1676.20 - 1678.20] P:1329.52 E:0.107553 |  Van Dijk will run forward.
[1678.20 - 1680.20] P:1533.08 E:0.107878 |  As it goes to Ackie on that left-hand side,
[1680.20 - 1682.20] P:1318.19 E:0.103975 |  De Jong is quite deep.
[1682.20 - 1684.20] P:1344.49 E:0.102912 |  Girona's there as well.
[1684.20 - 1687.20] P:1563.94 E:0.118428 |  Glyn tracking back on the halfway line.
[1687.20 - 1690.20] P:1787.34 E:0.111815 |  Tom Fries is forward on this near side, the right.
[1690.20 - 1696.20] P:1882.88 E:0.116836 |  But this is a very, very cautious Dutch performance.
[1696.20 - 1698.20] P:1936.20 E:0.127830 |  This is in KG.
[1698.20 - 1704.20] P:1871.04 E:0.102785 |  The strikers Bergmeiden, De Pye, really split.
[1704.20 - 1711.20] P:1503.17 E:0.102716 |  Occupying the wide centre backs of that Argentinian back three.
[1711.20 - 1714.20] P:1665.98 E:0.094178 |  Gac Pope playing deeper.
[1714.20 - 1716.20] P:1597.45 E:0.119461 |  Doesn't really go on the ball this evening.
[1716.20 - 1720.20] P:1607.92 E:0.107148 |  Gac Pope's forward ball. Bergmeiden controls it with his right foot.
[1720.20 - 1725.20] P:1644.74 E:0.107284 |  Plays it to Tom Fries on the right-hand side now level with the area.
[1725.20 - 1727.20] P:1704.02 E:0.115417 |  Gac Pope chips over the cross.
[1727.20 - 1729.20] P:1676.58 E:0.113503 |  De Pye and Glyn for both there.
[1729.20 - 1732.20] P:1580.84 E:0.100448 |  Around eight yards out, cleared.
[1732.20 - 1734.20] P:1695.00 E:0.107799 |  De Jong lifts it a long way back,
[1734.20 - 1737.20] P:1933.05 E:0.102930 |  rides up onto the chest of Van Dijk.
[1737.20 - 1741.20] P:1847.95 E:0.111753 |  And now Giron takes over, rides the centre circle.
[1741.20 - 1745.20] P:1781.27 E:0.113277 |  Timber loses it to the Callister.
[1745.20 - 1747.20] P:1496.36 E:0.084982 |  Fernandez, messy.
[1747.20 - 1749.20] P:1469.36 E:0.097796 |  Challenge comes in from De Jong.
[1749.20 - 1752.20] P:1428.54 E:0.091102 |  Messy holds on to it.
[1752.20 - 1755.20] P:1726.09 E:0.110990 |  And now gives it to Romero.
[1755.20 - 1757.20] P:1445.01 E:0.092657 |  Molina's ahead of it.
[1757.20 - 1760.20] P:1607.98 E:0.108157 |  Inside now to De Paul.
[1760.20 - 1762.20] P:1760.08 E:0.113517 |  Messy's joining the attack.
[1762.20 - 1765.20] P:1722.20 E:0.111288 |  Macaste lets it go underneath his right foot as a result.
[1765.20 - 1770.20] P:1440.50 E:0.091394 |  There's a little bit of the momentum that they were building there, Argentina.
[1770.20 - 1772.20] P:1367.66 E:0.101036 |  Here is De Paul.
[1772.20 - 1774.20] P:1121.39 E:0.102870 |  Fernandez.
[1774.20 - 1779.20] P:1374.38 E:0.115245 |  He had that conversation last night on the preview show.
[1779.20 - 1781.20] P:1439.68 E:0.119746 |  Is it four or six?
[1781.20 - 1784.20] P:1622.80 E:0.115190 |  Well, it's the Cinco, the five-roll.

[1808.20 - 1811.20] P:1438.92 E:0.109020 |  Fernandez plays the ball out towards that far side of the right.
[1811.20 - 1814.20] P:1468.04 E:0.100510 |  Back inside it goes towards De Paul.
[1814.20 - 1815.20] P:1477.37 E:0.122443 |  He was trying to wave.

[1833.20 - 1834.20] P:1681.37 E:0.109710 |  It does well to hit.
[1834.20 - 1837.20] P:1640.55 E:0.116492 |  His hearing was excellent, by the way.
[1837.20 - 1841.20] P:1944.43 E:0.123046 |  One of the coaches has been showing a yellow card.
[1844.20 - 1849.20] P:1899.65 E:0.117732 |  You said he's no nonsense, Ian.
[1849.20 - 1852.20] P:1750.24 E:0.107547 |  What is no nonsense in Spanish?
[1852.20 - 1855.20] P:1746.72 E:0.107105 |  We'll find out for you.

[1867.20 - 1868.20] P:1690.87 E:0.128766 |  Sometimes you can...
[1868.20 - 1869.20] P:1464.48 E:0.129020 |  I like that, though.
[1869.20 - 1873.20] P:1567.25 E:0.102754 |  I've probably got a yellow card for my pronunciation.
[1873.20 - 1874.20] P:1521.66 E:0.126528 |  Depirement.
[1874.20 - 1878.20] P:1375.80 E:0.084725 |  I think yellow's generous.
[1878.20 - 1879.20] P:1604.95 E:0.115188 |  Fernandez runs forward.

[1898.20 - 1901.20] P:1678.26 E:0.095008 |  And here he is, 30 yards out from goal.
[1901.20 - 1903.20] P:1581.91 E:0.100908 |  Finds McCallister with his back to goal.

[1910.20 - 1912.20] P:1512.63 E:0.109010 |  The referee's playing the advantage.
[1912.20 - 1914.20] P:1396.97 E:0.105772 |  He's making that decision.
[1914.20 - 1918.20] P:1387.80 E:0.095034 |  That's a good decision from the referee.
[1918.20 - 1920.20] P:1468.97 E:0.097437 |  Fernandez out wide.
[1920.20 - 1921.20] P:1574.31 E:0.112684 |  It goes to the right.

[1936.20 - 1938.20] P:1452.84 E:0.112605 |  Messi now running onto the ball.

[1941.20 - 1943.20] P:1504.02 E:0.114142 |  Alvarez a heavy first touch.
[1943.20 - 1945.20] P:1597.83 E:0.111831 |  Presents it to Gakpo who runs forward.
[1945.20 - 1947.20] P:1776.26 E:0.103875 |  This is where the Dutch can strike.
[1947.20 - 1952.20] P:1841.65 E:0.113052 |  D'Amphrice cut out though by Isandro Martinez.
[1952.20 - 1954.20] P:1785.97 E:0.104363 |  Now it's with McCallister.
[1954.20 - 1957.20] P:1636.64 E:0.108478 |  And McCallister accelerates over the halfway line.
[1957.20 - 1959.20] P:1671.70 E:0.117555 |  De Paul plays the ball forward.
[1959.20 - 1961.20] P:1634.71 E:0.110287 |  Molina pulls it back.
[1961.20 - 1962.20] P:1704.74 E:0.109888 |  McCallister turns.
[1962.20 - 1964.20] P:1748.83 E:0.117045 |  De Paul tries to place it right footed.
[1964.20 - 1967.20] P:1703.39 E:0.114710 |  And he went for placement rather than power.
[1967.20 - 1969.20] P:1728.41 E:0.113932 |  And it was a comfortable save by Knopper.
[1969.20 - 1972.20] P:1712.52 E:0.118428 |  Yeah, real lack of conviction with the effort eventually.
[1972.20 - 1974.20] P:1504.00 E:0.092423 |  They work it well.
[1974.20 - 1976.20] P:1526.46 E:0.120226 |  Argentina on the turnover.
[1976.20 - 1978.20] P:1532.73 E:0.106892 |  And as the ball is weighted back to De Paul,
[1978.20 - 1980.20] P:1673.17 E:0.105840 |  it's only 20 yards out.
[1980.20 - 1984.20] P:1536.22 E:0.103945 |  He goes safe with the inside of his right foot.
[1984.20 - 1988.20] P:1613.02 E:0.101378 |  Got a go for Broke there.
[1988.20 - 1991.20] P:1783.39 E:0.102267 |  Put your foot through the ball.
[1991.20 - 1995.20] P:1676.20 E:0.113720 |  Was that the first shot on target?
[1995.20 - 1999.20] P:1733.12 E:0.118582 |  Probably is actually.
[1999.20 - 2001.20] P:1923.58 E:0.128232 |  Certainly.
[2001.20 - 2007.20] P:1806.48 E:0.121614 |  Scoring opportunities have been few and far between
[2007.20 - 2009.20] P:1633.96 E:0.122856 |  the two teams.
[2009.20 - 2013.20] P:1554.45 E:0.105953 |  And it's a fervent atmosphere.

[2016.20 - 2021.20] P:1460.34 E:0.091702 |  And we are still 0-0.

[2025.20 - 2031.20] P:1548.90 E:0.091596 |  Morocco, Portugal and then England, France at 7 o'clock.
[2031.20 - 2033.20] P:1586.54 E:0.113304 |  The championship is back tomorrow.
[2033.20 - 2035.20] P:1523.79 E:0.107423 |  Nine games for the football league.
[2035.20 - 2037.20] P:1643.24 E:0.112870 |  Back in full swing.
[2037.20 - 2039.20] P:1578.98 E:0.090783 |  Five live sport from 12.

[2049.20 - 2053.20] P:1863.72 E:0.117917 |  And Argentina have got it.
[2053.20 - 2060.20] P:1740.05 E:0.119742 |  Argentina through Molina.
[2060.20 - 2064.20] P:1789.50 E:0.117933 |  His first goal for his country.
[2064.20 - 2068.20] P:1746.79 E:0.117958 |  Finding the bottom left hand corner.
[2068.20 - 2073.20] P:1610.77 E:0.122699 |  The Argentinian supporters are delirious.
[2073.20 - 2076.20] P:1497.95 E:0.125138 |  Messi with a delightful ball.
[2076.20 - 2079.20] P:1675.17 E:0.117318 |  It pierced the Dutch defense.
[2079.20 - 2083.20] P:1687.70 E:0.119440 |  And it was Polto.
[2083.20 - 2085.20] P:1683.06 E:0.121267 |  Netherlands 0.
[2085.20 - 2087.20] P:1656.38 E:0.116150 |  Argentina 1.
[2087.20 - 2096.20] P:1668.34 E:0.118471 |  He doesn't have so many moments of influence now.
[2096.20 - 2098.20] P:1719.58 E:0.117510 |  Because he's getting on a bit messy.
[2098.20 - 2100.20] P:1707.69 E:0.120247 |  But this is genius.
[2100.20 - 2104.20] P:1654.67 E:0.117469 |  Just creates a little bit of space against Nathan Ackay.
[2104.20 - 2106.20] P:1606.37 E:0.120905 |  And reverses the ball.
[2106.20 - 2108.20] P:1641.23 E:0.110580 |  Onto Molina.
[2108.20 - 2111.20] P:1562.13 E:0.110452 |  Who takes a brilliant first touch.
[2111.20 - 2112.20] P:1463.57 E:0.097533 |  Left footed.
[2112.20 - 2114.20] P:1646.61 E:0.117974 |  Van Dyke tries to put him under pressure.
[2114.20 - 2117.20] P:1667.34 E:0.116750 |  And then with the outside of his right boot.
[2117.20 - 2120.20] P:1603.65 E:0.125940 |  Finishes brilliantly.
[2120.20 - 2123.20] P:1710.51 E:0.124955 |  Plus the giant Noppert in the Dutch goal.
[2123.20 - 2127.20] P:1648.39 E:0.114542 |  What a ball. What a finish.
[2127.20 - 2131.20] P:1341.14 E:0.121172 |  And the Dutch need to respond.
[2131.20 - 2138.20] P:1638.77 E:0.119207 |  What an awful time to bring your first goal for your country.
[2138.20 - 2142.20] P:1731.15 E:0.118902 |  If you've ever tracked his career.
[2142.20 - 2144.20] P:1590.71 E:0.127260 |  He's used to scoring goals.
[2144.20 - 2147.20] P:1335.45 E:0.116503 |  Eight last season for Udenaise.
[2147.20 - 2151.20] P:1527.34 E:0.109029 |  Now plays his football at Atlético Madrid.
[2151.20 - 2158.20] P:1692.57 E:0.104972 |  But for a player who broke into the side during Argentina's successful Copa America.
[2158.20 - 2160.20] P:1880.79 E:0.112882 |  He took it so well.
[2160.20 - 2163.20] P:1974.53 E:0.121156 |  But the through ball from Messi.
[2163.20 - 2165.20] P:1933.72 E:0.115709 |  Yep.
[2165.20 - 2167.20] P:1731.40 E:0.129751 |  Amazing, amazing pass.
[2167.20 - 2170.20] P:1623.13 E:0.104592 |  Eyes in the back of his head pass.
[2170.20 - 2173.20] P:1469.07 E:0.115598 |  Most players wouldn't see that ball.
[2173.20 - 2176.20] P:1635.06 E:0.113118 |  But then he has to wait the pass perfectly.
[2176.20 - 2179.20] P:1611.85 E:0.109624 |  And boy does he great run by Molina.
[2179.20 - 2182.20] P:1506.23 E:0.119624 |  And there's a brilliant first touch with his left foot.
[2182.20 - 2184.20] P:1692.91 E:0.113132 |  Took it into his stride.
[2184.20 - 2187.20] P:1573.77 E:0.117845 |  And then just stayed composed.
[2187.20 - 2189.20] P:1532.59 E:0.116415 |  Noppert.
[2189.20 - 2190.20] P:1736.80 E:0.127366 |  Close the angle.
[2190.20 - 2192.20] P:1614.19 E:0.112264 |  Outside of the right boot.
[2192.20 - 2196.20] P:1440.69 E:0.115763 |  And listen to this.
[2196.20 - 2198.20] P:1715.14 E:0.116268 |  I'm deliberately not saying anything.
[2198.20 - 2200.20] P:1512.06 E:0.113253 |  For five seconds.
[2200.20 - 2202.20] P:1568.88 E:0.105208 |  Close your eyes.
[2207.20 - 2213.20] P:1587.77 E:0.108065 |  And just think of every man, woman, boy and girl.
[2213.20 - 2218.20] P:1684.56 E:0.102842 |  Decked in a blue and white striped shirt.
[2218.20 - 2220.20] P:1503.14 E:0.109562 |  Jumping up and down.
[2220.20 - 2224.20] P:1654.34 E:0.105392 |  And throwing their arms in the air.
[2224.20 - 2226.20] P:1702.51 E:0.122324 |  Whether it be the balloons.
[2226.20 - 2228.20] P:1700.40 E:0.110056 |  The flats.
[2228.20 - 2230.20] P:1731.30 E:0.111149 |  Scarves.
[2230.20 - 2232.20] P:1761.91 E:0.113505 |  Shirts.
[2238.20 - 2241.20] P:1529.61 E:0.111887 |  And there's now a stoppage in play.
[2241.20 - 2243.20] P:1858.83 E:0.110433 |  Here to Paul.
[2243.20 - 2246.20] P:1733.70 E:0.121339 |  He was a round coming into the game, wasn't he?
[2246.20 - 2249.20] P:1601.78 E:0.107026 |  He was, but I think this is a head injury.
[2249.20 - 2251.20] P:1777.31 E:0.089155 |  To Paul back on his feet.
[2251.20 - 2255.20] P:1643.77 E:0.100230 |  But we know how head injuries have been treated.
[2255.20 - 2257.20] P:1687.54 E:0.092428 |  Throughout this tournament.
[2257.20 - 2259.20] P:1640.99 E:0.076135 |  Once again.
[2259.20 - 2263.20] P:1640.12 E:0.104808 |  Not really given a thorough check.
[2263.20 - 2265.20] P:1604.43 E:0.095676 |  That they carry on regardless.
[2265.20 - 2266.20] P:1443.87 E:0.106224 |  Play a welfare.
[2266.20 - 2268.20] P:1654.77 E:0.070359 |  I'm afraid.
[2268.20 - 2273.20] P:1638.34 E:0.094188 |  Seems to have gone out the window at this World Cup.
[2273.20 - 2279.20] P:1610.92 E:0.095463 |  We've got seven minutes to go to half time.
[2279.20 - 2281.20] P:1515.42 E:0.098898 |  The Netherlands nil.
[2281.20 - 2283.20] P:1721.57 E:0.110705 |  Argentina won.
[2283.20 - 2286.20] P:1638.31 E:0.109720 |  And now the Dutch have a bit of a problem, don't they?
[2286.20 - 2291.20] P:1481.47 E:0.086718 |  They're set up to counter attack.
[2291.20 - 2294.20] P:1452.63 E:0.092939 |  They're going to have to be braver now.
[2294.20 - 2297.20] P:1552.40 E:0.094326 |  Show some Dutch courage.
[2297.20 - 2300.20] P:1695.20 E:0.118437 |  I'm beaten in 19 since Louis van Haal.
[2300.20 - 2303.20] P:1727.22 E:0.102559 |  Took over for his third stint.
[2303.20 - 2305.20] P:1745.02 E:0.114799 |  As a CUNY was trying to get forward here.
[2305.20 - 2309.20] P:1683.12 E:0.093833 |  But Dumfries did just enough to see the ball back.
[2309.20 - 2312.20] P:1774.91 E:0.117185 |  He's won 14 and he's drawn five of his 19 games.
[2312.20 - 2313.20] P:1769.63 E:0.114909 |  Louis van Haal.
[2313.20 - 2315.20] P:1696.12 E:0.103820 |  But now the 71 year old.
[2315.20 - 2318.20] P:1702.09 E:0.112445 |  We heard earlier on about there are a number of Dutch journalists
[2318.20 - 2322.20] P:1752.32 E:0.115651 |  who are not happy about the style of football that the Netherlands are playing.
[2322.20 - 2324.20] P:1626.37 E:0.108652 |  They're now going to have to attack.
[2324.20 - 2326.20] P:1829.09 E:0.107561 |  They're now going to have to raise their game.
[2326.20 - 2331.20] P:1639.45 E:0.109767 |  They've been quite cautious in what had been a tight first half.
[2331.20 - 2335.20] P:1543.81 E:0.107589 |  But it was Argentina who had been probing and messy.
[2335.20 - 2337.20] P:1568.59 E:0.106889 |  Unlocked the Dutch defence.
[2337.20 - 2340.20] P:1724.85 E:0.099089 |  That was a slack ball by the goalkeeper to De Jong.
[2340.20 - 2343.20] P:1810.65 E:0.103673 |  So now they are going to have to change their tactics the Dutch.
[2343.20 - 2347.20] P:1721.39 E:0.116270 |  Listen, it's okay being ugly Dutch.
[2347.20 - 2348.20] P:1738.85 E:0.125321 |  If you're winning.
[2348.20 - 2349.20] P:1864.89 E:0.108121 |  Here is Alvarez.
[2349.20 - 2351.20] P:1769.72 E:0.112286 |  Alvarez to Messi.
[2351.20 - 2353.20] P:1801.21 E:0.119319 |  Messi looking to turn in the penalty area.
[2353.20 - 2354.20] P:1838.88 E:0.111683 |  Messi does turn.
[2354.20 - 2356.20] P:1804.22 E:0.111733 |  Low right foot is shot.
[2356.20 - 2358.20] P:1854.62 E:0.113826 |  No real pace on it.
[2358.20 - 2360.20] P:1825.72 E:0.113760 |  And a comfortable save from Nopper.
[2360.20 - 2361.20] P:1750.10 E:0.109412 |  Argentina with a better team.
[2361.20 - 2362.20] P:1506.63 E:0.118661 |  They absolutely are.
[2362.20 - 2364.20] P:1675.69 E:0.118340 |  Alvarez left hand side of the box.
[2364.20 - 2366.20] P:1631.91 E:0.115840 |  The ball into Messi.
[2366.20 - 2367.20] P:1654.61 E:0.119666 |  And it's twisting one way.
[2367.20 - 2369.20] P:1652.31 E:0.110047 |  Twisting the other way.
[2369.20 - 2370.20] P:1775.53 E:0.122288 |  Get a little half yard.
[2370.20 - 2372.20] P:1603.72 E:0.110177 |  Fires the shot off right footed.
[2372.20 - 2375.20] P:1492.41 E:0.086295 |  Comfortable from Nopper.
[2375.20 - 2383.20] P:1683.15 E:0.098471 |  Messi's name was just reverberating around the stadium here in La Salle.
[2383.20 - 2385.20] P:1804.12 E:0.110270 |  Idolised.
[2385.20 - 2387.20] P:1677.52 E:0.111525 |  Here is Dumfries.
[2387.20 - 2390.20] P:1565.26 E:0.114160 |  Trip.
[2390.20 - 2394.20] P:1594.57 E:0.110545 |  And that was a foul on Gatbo.
[2394.20 - 2397.20] P:1453.15 E:0.106769 |  And it will present the Netherlands with a free kick.
[2397.20 - 2398.20] P:1716.40 E:0.108799 |  25 yards out.
[2398.20 - 2399.20] P:1655.41 E:0.107207 |  Right of centre.
[2399.20 - 2401.20] P:1716.34 E:0.103770 |  5 minutes to go to halftime.
[2401.20 - 2405.20] P:1538.47 E:0.101537 |  Just careless from Enzo Fernandez.
[2405.20 - 2407.20] P:1505.20 E:0.113901 |  Back for the right hand channel.
[2407.20 - 2409.20] P:1618.86 E:0.096309 |  Back to goal.
[2409.20 - 2412.20] P:1640.12 E:0.107741 |  His heels clipped.
[2412.20 - 2416.20] P:1539.61 E:0.109582 |  And the Dutch produced something from this free kick.
[2416.20 - 2417.20] P:1532.42 E:0.119942 |  And Dijk's gone forward.
[2417.20 - 2420.20] P:1533.97 E:0.099974 |  Gatbo is going to take it if it's right footed.
[2420.20 - 2423.20] P:1729.58 E:0.114224 |  If it's the in-swinger, it will be Blintoppe's left.
[2423.20 - 2424.20] P:1543.13 E:0.112670 |  Argentina leading 1-0.
[2424.20 - 2427.20] P:1698.13 E:0.113334 |  They've got a two-man wall inside the penalty area.
[2427.20 - 2429.20] P:1662.86 E:0.114474 |  Very high line from Argentina.
[2429.20 - 2431.20] P:1631.58 E:0.113688 |  This.
[2431.20 - 2433.20] P:1560.76 E:0.120835 |  Gatbo lifts his arms in the air.
[2433.20 - 2434.20] P:1134.20 E:0.113205 |  He's going to leave it for Nopper.
[2434.20 - 2435.20] P:1320.76 E:0.111213 |  Leave it for Gatbo.
[2435.20 - 2436.20] P:1519.69 E:0.113298 |  It's right footed.
[2436.20 - 2437.20] P:1553.16 E:0.113677 |  Curled in.
[2437.20 - 2439.20] P:1807.09 E:0.119900 |  And the referee has spotted.
[2439.20 - 2442.20] P:1614.79 E:0.116558 |  A clash between a couple of players.
[2442.20 - 2445.20] P:1647.43 E:0.115350 |  But it was a header out as well.
[2445.20 - 2447.20] P:1751.59 E:0.108689 |  I don't know about you.
[2447.20 - 2451.20] P:1632.99 E:0.119013 |  I feel quite tired just looking at the Argentinian support.
[2451.20 - 2455.20] P:1444.18 E:0.114185 |  The nerve working hard.
[2455.20 - 2456.20] P:1337.85 E:0.105306 |  Dear me.
[2456.20 - 2460.20] P:1633.38 E:0.115979 |  What a...

[2469.20 - 2470.20] P:1402.12 E:0.115811 |  What a...
[2470.20 - 2472.20] P:1618.58 E:0.123029 |  Pleasure it is to be here.
[2472.20 - 2473.20] P:1509.59 E:0.096167 |  What a racket.
[2473.20 - 2475.20] P:1384.15 E:0.104361 |  It's a lovely racket.
[2475.20 - 2482.20] P:1406.89 E:0.105400 |  For being on as some of the atmospheres at this World Cup have been quite flat.
[2482.20 - 2487.20] P:1644.76 E:0.116134 |  Not an Argentina plate.
[2487.20 - 2489.20] P:1740.33 E:0.124528 |  Just think.
[2489.20 - 2492.20] P:1588.55 E:0.116984 |  If they get to the semi-final or indeed the final,
[2492.20 - 2495.20] P:1597.94 E:0.106292 |  if there's 50,000 in Qatar now,
[2495.20 - 2497.20] P:1597.19 E:0.107436 |  you could double that.
[2497.20 - 2499.20] P:1574.65 E:0.114531 |  They will travel en masse.
[2499.20 - 2501.20] P:1566.93 E:0.106774 |  They travel in such numbers anyway.
[2501.20 - 2503.20] P:1493.34 E:0.114382 |  As Ake's over on that far side,
[2503.20 - 2506.20] P:1580.76 E:0.110117 |  he has to go back to Wurtanoppe.
[2506.20 - 2510.20] P:1645.99 E:0.106840 |  6'8", goalkeeper Klerz left footed downfield.
[2510.20 - 2513.20] P:1586.08 E:0.105724 |  And Ottenendy just lifted out towards that far side.
[2513.20 - 2515.20] P:1615.10 E:0.103574 |  And we have three minutes to go to halftime.
[2515.20 - 2518.20] P:1574.32 E:0.091298 |  Hooks away back by Molina.
[2518.20 - 2520.20] P:1696.72 E:0.117649 |  And it will run through to the Dutch keeper.
[2520.20 - 2522.20] P:1760.72 E:0.116498 |  We all thought Brazil would throw earlier, didn't we?
[2522.20 - 2524.20] P:1786.25 E:0.073467 |  We went Neymar, put them ahead.
[2524.20 - 2526.20] P:1790.11 E:0.100182 |  We didn't get the job done.
[2526.20 - 2529.20] P:1820.47 E:0.098257 |  I think from a Dutch point of view,
[2529.20 - 2534.20] P:1821.83 E:0.112539 |  they haven't given the Argentinian backline enough to think about.
[2534.20 - 2536.20] P:1855.55 E:0.102853 |  The strikers are split.
[2536.20 - 2538.20] P:1675.51 E:0.093444 |  Didn't they link up once?
[2538.20 - 2541.20] P:1736.42 E:0.098831 |  The effort from Bergwein, which is off target.
[2541.20 - 2543.20] P:1770.93 E:0.119664 |  There is Bergwein out to them, three's.
[2543.20 - 2545.20] P:1649.09 E:0.117925 |  The right wing back.
[2545.20 - 2549.20] P:1786.56 E:0.122887 |  He's lost the ball to the junior, the Spanish referee
[2549.20 - 2552.20] P:1839.52 E:0.118089 |  has given a free kick in favour of the Netherlands.
[2552.20 - 2558.20] P:1871.64 E:0.114868 |  And now he's shown a yellow card to Jürien Timber.
[2558.20 - 2563.20] P:1755.79 E:0.106572 |  So the Dutch defender, despite the Netherlands getting a free kick,
[2563.20 - 2565.20] P:1739.23 E:0.117026 |  he's the Bournemouth shown yellow.
[2565.20 - 2574.20] P:1452.88 E:0.106241 |  He's saying for an earlier push, Timber, but Timber lands a yellow.
[2574.20 - 2578.20] P:1673.22 E:0.120396 |  And there's one, I think, is that Cunha as well?
[2578.20 - 2580.20] P:1903.55 E:0.116377 |  He's just shown another yellow card.
[2580.20 - 2583.20] P:1774.62 E:0.105521 |  And then there's Cunha, who's received the yellow card.
[2583.20 - 2586.20] P:1723.91 E:0.084661 |  Well, if that's the case, that rules him out at the semi-final.
[2586.20 - 2591.20] P:1730.59 E:0.103970 |  So Cunha now will miss the semi-final, should Argentina go through.
[2591.20 - 2594.20] P:1515.12 E:0.108920 |  And he's having words with the referee.
[2594.20 - 2596.20] P:1706.15 E:0.099081 |  He's not going to rescind it now.
[2596.20 - 2600.20] P:1741.59 E:0.093502 |  Do you know what? Seeing the challenge on Dumfries,
[2600.20 - 2602.20] P:1680.28 E:0.106079 |  there's a really poor challenge.
[2602.20 - 2608.20] P:1654.22 E:0.098901 |  And then what happens is, after the challenge, Timber isn't happy.
[2608.20 - 2613.20] P:1681.02 E:0.105850 |  And there's a Cunha, who goes over, pushes him over.
[2613.20 - 2616.20] P:1554.55 E:0.091865 |  That's why he's all yellow.
[2616.20 - 2622.20] P:1433.59 E:0.102244 |  Cunha rakes his right boot in the back.
[2622.20 - 2625.20] P:1519.17 E:0.119011 |  Dumfries's Achilles is a really poor challenge.
[2625.20 - 2629.20] P:1738.84 E:0.112595 |  Dumfries up, hobbling.
[2629.20 - 2632.20] P:1830.75 E:0.112740 |  So it's a free kick to the Netherlands, who trailed by a goal to Niel.
[2632.20 - 2636.20] P:1787.48 E:0.090812 |  And it's a very high line from Argentina.
[2636.20 - 2639.20] P:1655.07 E:0.096544 |  And then he's going to bring the out in from the right.
[2639.20 - 2641.20] P:1857.09 E:0.101388 |  Blint and Gatpo are going to take it,
[2641.20 - 2646.20] P:1780.13 E:0.094133 |  but they've offered so much protection here to Elie Martinez.
[2646.20 - 2649.20] P:1767.03 E:0.106023 |  Free kick then.
[2649.20 - 2651.20] P:1867.12 E:0.113475 |  Blint leaves it for Gatpo once again.
[2651.20 - 2654.20] P:1706.60 E:0.097457 |  It's swung in, but Dac was there.
[2654.20 - 2656.20] P:1683.62 E:0.108680 |  Achilles at the far side to try and head it back,
[2656.20 - 2659.20] P:1755.08 E:0.113151 |  and then balled away by De Paul.
[2659.20 - 2662.20] P:1577.61 E:0.112632 |  What a ball that was. Really tempting.
[2662.20 - 2665.20] P:1555.18 E:0.088944 |  I think it was Romero, who got his head to the ball.
[2665.20 - 2667.20] P:1343.88 E:0.098969 |  He's a little bit of a defender.
[2667.20 - 2669.20] P:1656.76 E:0.119842 |  Romero, well, that's handball.
[2669.20 - 2673.20] P:1685.70 E:0.107095 |  It's ridiculous Romero. What's he thinking of?
[2673.20 - 2679.20] P:1651.83 E:0.099542 |  That's volleyball, that is.
[2679.20 - 2683.20] P:1784.79 E:0.114115 |  Just instinctively brought his right arm up to squat his away.
[2683.20 - 2686.20] P:1400.23 E:0.104575 |  It's a ridiculous decision.
[2686.20 - 2689.20] P:1576.78 E:0.107876 |  Romero, little back heel from De Pye.
[2689.20 - 2694.20] P:1570.62 E:0.108406 |  He's going over his head and a big Argentinian fist coming in.
[2695.20 - 2698.20] P:1551.80 E:0.101296 |  Piping the ball away.
[2698.20 - 2700.20] P:1589.31 E:0.101279 |  It's like he was playing tennis.
[2700.20 - 2703.20] P:1508.76 E:0.113216 |  Go to serve and volley.
[2703.20 - 2704.20] P:1587.80 E:0.105040 |  60th.
[2704.20 - 2706.20] P:1550.88 E:0.114297 |  Win the 45th minute.
[2706.20 - 2707.20] P:1533.96 E:0.110175 |  Free kick.
[2707.20 - 2709.20] P:1387.01 E:0.106452 |  Curled in.
[2709.20 - 2712.20] P:1736.94 E:0.116225 |  Golcuba and in Martinez's safe hands, diving down.
[2712.20 - 2717.20] P:1687.57 E:0.112151 |  What it does mean though is that you've now got Romero and Acunha.
[2717.20 - 2720.20] P:1720.16 E:0.113604 |  Little bit of niggle out there as well now inside after that challenge.
[2720.20 - 2724.20] P:1642.31 E:0.104184 |  There was Acay and Acunha.
[2724.20 - 2728.20] P:1625.14 E:0.108581 |  Acunha just had a little tug there of Acay.
[2728.20 - 2731.20] P:1351.87 E:0.118663 |  Maybe so.
[2731.20 - 2736.20] P:1440.19 E:0.097977 |  Acay had run on the inside of Enzo Fernandez and they're coming together.
[2736.20 - 2738.20] P:1555.68 E:0.111558 |  Acay went down.
[2738.20 - 2740.20] P:1101.04 E:0.112648 |  Martinez gathered.
[2740.20 - 2742.20] P:1684.19 E:0.115703 |  He's not been worked enough though.
[2742.20 - 2744.20] P:1471.54 E:0.113123 |  Demi Martinez.
[2744.20 - 2748.20] P:1299.09 E:0.111698 |  Comfortable evening for him so far.
[2748.20 - 2751.20] P:1515.49 E:0.116908 |  Louis Van Hal, the iron chulip.
[2751.20 - 2754.20] P:1205.00 E:0.100562 |  I've worked to do it half time.
[2754.20 - 2758.20] P:1509.91 E:0.112825 |  They certainly haven't been blooming in this first half, that is for sure.
[2758.20 - 2763.20] P:1660.87 E:0.096693 |  Five additional minutes in the second half where Argentina are leading by a goal to nil.
[2763.20 - 2765.20] P:1436.96 E:0.092286 |  Noel Molina.
[2765.20 - 2769.20] P:1507.76 E:0.077149 |  But Messi with the assist.
[2769.20 - 2772.20] P:1561.76 E:0.090217 |  Lovely through ball.
[2772.20 - 2774.20] P:1413.98 E:0.090260 |  Timber.
[2774.20 - 2777.20] P:1553.42 E:0.109510 |  Square to Van Dyke.
[2777.20 - 2783.20] P:1741.41 E:0.112008 |  Still hasn't been or doesn't appear to have been a shift in the way that the Dutch are playing.
[2783.20 - 2786.20] P:1559.73 E:0.113461 |  It's still slow, still a little bit predictable.
[2786.20 - 2792.20] P:1554.36 E:0.104681 |  Haven't seen Frankie D'Yong and they have got on the ball.
[2792.20 - 2800.20] P:1848.44 E:0.123197 |  Good on the ball enough and dictate who he is now but not as many touches as he would have liked.
[2800.20 - 2803.20] P:1850.45 E:0.113670 |  That's a stupid challenge from Alvarez.
[2803.20 - 2806.20] P:1900.99 E:0.112210 |  I mean he should see yellow. Here's another one though.
[2806.20 - 2813.20] P:1846.36 E:0.099880 |  The Dutch dug out this time. Is it Veghorser?
[2813.20 - 2816.20] P:1716.03 E:0.099458 |  He's got incredible hearing.
[2816.20 - 2821.20] P:1603.52 E:0.103605 |  Or he's a good lip reader in many languages.
[2821.20 - 2825.20] P:1650.68 E:0.107095 |  He's now shown a yellow card to each bench.
[2825.20 - 2827.20] P:1701.17 E:0.109799 |  Veghors has been shown yellow.
[2827.20 - 2831.20] P:1646.59 E:0.110905 |  Why is he not shown one to Julian Alvarez for that?
[2831.20 - 2836.20] P:1625.72 E:0.089147 |  Because that's a yellow card offence just clipped.
[2836.20 - 2839.20] P:1498.84 E:0.094704 |  Timber over.
[2839.20 - 2842.20] P:1468.00 E:0.088019 |  Timber was fouled.
[2842.20 - 2845.20] P:1608.20 E:0.106967 |  There was no attempt to play the ball by Alvarez.
[2845.20 - 2850.20] P:1687.20 E:0.107618 |  What you've got to say though is that we've just seen in the last few minutes as D'Yong hits a flat forward ball.
[2850.20 - 2855.20] P:1796.74 E:0.113562 |  Gatpo's glancing header goes through to Emi Martinez. He drives forward.
[2855.20 - 2863.20] P:1641.31 E:0.112698 |  With the lack of discipline by Romero and then Alvarez and a little bit by Kunja. Would that worry you?
[2863.20 - 2866.20] P:1515.81 E:0.097696 |  Yeah of course it would.
[2866.20 - 2869.20] P:1755.76 E:0.106902 |  Yellow cards.
[2869.20 - 2874.20] P:1444.32 E:0.110890 |  They need to keep 11 men on the field if they want to go through.
[2874.20 - 2878.20] P:1506.56 E:0.117634 |  11 men on the field. They certainly got the 12th run.
[2878.20 - 2880.20] P:1447.61 E:0.118956 |  In the stands.
[2880.20 - 2883.20] P:1410.92 E:0.111414 |  Was it 1998? Ortega?
[2883.20 - 2887.20] P:1618.23 E:0.080180 |  He saw Red, Burkamp scored.
[2887.20 - 2889.20] P:1648.45 E:0.125146 |  Not a Newman was...
[2889.20 - 2894.20] P:1525.37 E:0.075105 |  Not a goal too late to hit yet. Newman sent off 10-12 minutes before that.
[2894.20 - 2899.20] P:1524.48 E:0.112759 |  Yeah we talk about the history between the two. I mean obviously 78-98.
[2899.20 - 2903.20] P:1602.93 E:0.111883 |  The way that Burkamp pulled down that long searching ball.
[2903.20 - 2906.20] P:1374.55 E:0.116209 |  One touch and then right footed, clipped it in.
[2906.20 - 2909.20] P:1533.44 E:0.102359 |  In Marseille in the sunshine.
[2909.20 - 2912.20] P:1300.89 E:0.087444 |  Here we are in the desert.
[2912.20 - 2916.20] P:1460.45 E:0.086435 |  One of the dark skies at Doha.
[2916.20 - 2920.20] P:1634.14 E:0.102482 |  Argentina are leading by a goal to nil.
[2920.20 - 2927.20] P:1743.30 E:0.105219 |  Although they've not beaten the Dutch in open play in their last six games.
[2927.20 - 2929.20] P:1482.96 E:0.111086 |  No.
[2929.20 - 2931.20] P:1670.98 E:0.120006 |  They're due.
[2931.20 - 2934.20] P:1929.58 E:0.100508 |  They're due.
[2934.20 - 2936.20] P:2010.30 E:0.110801 |  They do a break.
[2936.20 - 2938.20] P:1954.74 E:0.098979 |  The five minutes have added on time.
[2938.20 - 2940.20] P:1970.13 E:0.093644 |  They're almost over.
[2940.20 - 2943.20] P:1846.53 E:0.094356 |  Netherlands nil. Argentina won.
[2943.20 - 2946.20] P:1798.45 E:0.098726 |  Molina's goal 10 minutes before half time.
[2946.20 - 2948.20] P:1599.25 E:0.089448 |  Here's the difference.
[2948.20 - 2953.20] P:1698.47 E:0.103574 |  And the Dutch and they are going to need to put in an improved second half performance.
[2953.20 - 2957.20] P:1588.71 E:0.101366 |  It's okay. It's okay being pragmatic.
[2957.20 - 2962.20] P:1661.64 E:0.107449 |  But you've got to have a punch and the Dutch haven't landed.
[2962.20 - 2965.20] P:1849.72 E:0.115832 |  No foul or messy.
[2965.20 - 2970.20] P:1871.07 E:0.113958 |  Referee coming under huge pressure from the vast Argentinian support.
[2970.20 - 2974.20] P:1869.93 E:0.105491 |  And Scolodi down below with his arms out, stretched wide.
[2974.20 - 2977.20] P:1714.10 E:0.097496 |  A lot of occasion.
[2977.20 - 2980.20] P:1632.53 E:0.108833 |  Spanish referee keeps his cards in his pocket.
[2980.20 - 2983.20] P:1638.87 E:0.107103 |  De Pye out towards the far side of the left for Blint.
[2983.20 - 2985.20] P:1657.60 E:0.098510 |  Square ball.
[2985.20 - 2989.20] P:1731.04 E:0.107099 |  Blint then is, as he checks off the ball.
[2989.20 - 2991.20] P:1781.65 E:0.105537 |  The referee says no.
[2991.20 - 2994.20] P:1764.82 E:0.095433 |  Blint, shake of the head.
[2994.20 - 2997.20] P:1662.07 E:0.101762 |  And it runs out of play for a goal kick.
[2997.20 - 3001.20] P:1489.23 E:0.102452 |  Blint playing that first time.
[3001.20 - 3004.20] P:1444.08 E:0.093043 |  Trying to make the run.
[3004.20 - 3007.20] P:1622.24 E:0.108198 |  Not enough contact. Goes down too easily.
[3007.20 - 3009.20] P:1532.99 E:0.095666 |  He's better than that.
[3009.20 - 3014.20] P:1550.18 E:0.110811 |  Maybe Blint haven't seen enough of him this evening.
[3017.20 - 3019.20] P:1554.52 E:0.111668 |  They look at great a threat.
[3019.20 - 3023.20] P:1615.03 E:0.091858 |  The Dutch down the right hand side.
[3023.20 - 3026.20] P:1684.87 E:0.107697 |  By my watch, the five minutes,
[3026.20 - 3029.20] P:1776.10 E:0.100890 |  he lapsed about 60 seconds ago of additional time.
[3029.20 - 3033.20] P:1712.62 E:0.098371 |  As the clearance from Emi Martinez goes straight out of play.
[3033.20 - 3036.20] P:1858.11 E:0.089440 |  When I said he was a fishess,
[3036.20 - 3040.20] P:1956.18 E:0.109545 |  at times he does make it all about himself as well as this Spanish referee.
[3040.20 - 3044.20] P:2048.22 E:0.107973 |  And once again, he's had a little glance at his watch.
[3044.20 - 3049.20] P:1909.36 E:0.097166 |  My way, or the highway.
[3049.20 - 3052.20] P:1806.58 E:0.104524 |  Here at the heart of the Argentinian defence is
[3052.20 - 3057.20] P:1697.73 E:0.094677 |  Christian Romero back towards Emi Martinez.
[3057.20 - 3062.20] P:1751.06 E:0.100563 |  Asandro Martinez drives it forward. Alvarez.
[3062.20 - 3064.20] P:1743.95 E:0.104221 |  Head down, actually strikes him on the back.
[3064.20 - 3066.20] P:1697.00 E:0.096013 |  And it's cleared away by Van Dijk.
[3066.20 - 3069.20] P:1881.64 E:0.110443 |  And there is the half-time whistle.
[3069.20 - 3071.20] P:1852.59 E:0.116938 |  And not that they pause for Brad.
[3071.20 - 3074.20] P:1762.83 E:0.129559 |  The Argentinian supporters cheer off their heroes
[3074.20 - 3078.20] P:1568.89 E:0.107682 |  because Messi with the assist.
[3078.20 - 3082.20] P:1545.14 E:0.111116 |  And Molina with his first goal for his country,
[3082.20 - 3086.20] P:1416.47 E:0.114590 |  giving Argentina a precious lead.
[3086.20 - 3089.20] P:1274.50 E:0.119701 |  And one moment in the first half,
[3089.20 - 3094.20] P:1511.18 E:0.103008 |  Masterful from Messi, how he saw the pass, let alone play it.
[3094.20 - 3096.20] P:1329.23 E:0.089811 |  Who knows?
[3096.20 - 3101.20] P:1387.27 E:0.107714 |  Wonderful pass that it was reversed into the marauding Molina,
[3101.20 - 3105.20] P:1473.18 E:0.102263 |  who took a wonderful first touch and finished beautifully.
[3105.20 - 3107.20] P:1634.67 E:0.113303 |  And that's the difference in this first half.
[3107.20 - 3110.20] P:1492.31 E:0.097797 |  I do think Argentina have just edged it
[3110.20 - 3113.20] P:1204.27 E:0.107781 |  with a touch in this second half.
[3113.20 - 3116.20] P:1253.66 E:0.107765 |  They're going to have to bring more to this party.
[3116.20 - 3122.20] P:1352.98 E:0.108387 |  Half-time here in La Salle, Netherlands 0, Argentina 1. Kelly.
[3122.20 - 3124.20] P:1131.85 E:0.121135 |  Thank you very much, Chris.
[3124.20 - 3128.20] P:1161.57 E:0.098154 |  Lionel Messi assisted five goals in the World Cup knockout stages.
[3128.20 - 3131.20] P:1190.93 E:0.107205 |  Since Opte have started having the numbers on World Cup assists,
[3131.20 - 3135.20] P:1127.99 E:0.103947 |  since 1966, this is the most on record in the knockout rounds.
[3135.20 - 3138.20] P:1046.58 E:0.100156 |  And that go pass, Kelly's record of four.
[3138.20 - 3141.20] P:1096.96 E:0.102717 |  So adding salt into the word for Brazil,
[3141.20 - 3144.20] P:1207.57 E:0.096865 |  who exited the World Cup at the hands of Croatia earlier.
[3144.20 - 3148.20] P:1104.78 E:0.107256 |  Lionel Messi says Stap Mandade now has seven World Cup assists in total.
[3148.20 - 3152.20] P:1245.90 E:0.110309 |  Only Diego Maradona has more for Argentina with eight.
[3152.20 - 3156.20] P:1223.75 E:0.105627 |  We already know that Messi is up there with the legends of the game.
[3156.20 - 3160.20] P:1120.62 E:0.103524 |  And as you said, the quality of that assist for Molina was incredible.
[3160.20 - 3164.20] P:1180.37 E:0.101588 |  But Argentina throughout this tournament have played in moments.
[3164.20 - 3167.20] P:1069.29 E:0.098049 |  There just seem to have been more moments in that first half
[3167.20 - 3169.20] P:1300.07 E:0.097423 |  than what we've seen in previous games.
[3169.20 - 3172.20] P:1148.72 E:0.103455 |  Yeah, I think that's really well put.
[3172.20 - 3176.20] P:1317.74 E:0.097625 |  They haven't dominated games, but getting out of the group stage,
[3176.20 - 3179.20] P:1423.14 E:0.110061 |  it was about little messy moments.
[3179.20 - 3182.20] P:1317.91 E:0.116420 |  Enzo Fernandez came on and influenced the game.
[3182.20 - 3185.20] P:1325.59 E:0.110951 |  Having said that, they blew away Poland.
[3185.20 - 3189.20] P:1458.30 E:0.108191 |  They weren't great when they got the better of Australia.
[3189.20 - 3193.20] P:1307.63 E:0.111319 |  But he's the player everybody looks up to.
[3193.20 - 3196.20] P:1466.66 E:0.110515 |  Not in size, of course, but in stature.
[3196.20 - 3199.20] P:1299.02 E:0.104742 |  And he doesn't influence games like he used to.
[3199.20 - 3203.20] P:1445.73 E:0.104797 |  But it's just a couple of seconds, got the better of Aki.
[3203.20 - 3205.20] P:1255.75 E:0.098567 |  But then to spot the ball,
[3205.20 - 3208.20] P:1487.70 E:0.109816 |  we don't just associate dribbling with Messi,
[3208.20 - 3210.20] P:1202.66 E:0.104673 |  but it was such an incredible spot.
[3210.20 - 3213.20] P:1417.44 E:0.106837 |  But then you have to get the weight of pass-ride.
[3213.20 - 3215.20] P:1322.91 E:0.114496 |  Molina had made a superb run.
[3215.20 - 3218.20] P:1283.44 E:0.109961 |  And then his first touch was, I'm not saying Messi liked,
[3218.20 - 3220.20] P:1285.40 E:0.110929 |  but it was a brilliant first touch,
[3220.20 - 3222.20] P:1373.74 E:0.111468 |  because he was under pressure from Van Dijk,
[3222.20 - 3225.20] P:1299.93 E:0.098354 |  who was trying to recover and get back at him,
[3225.20 - 3228.20] P:1404.65 E:0.109980 |  but he couldn't and he finished it so, so well.
[3228.20 - 3231.20] P:1358.18 E:0.107144 |  And that, essentially, is the difference in the first half.
[3231.20 - 3234.20] P:1380.54 E:0.103809 |  I can't really remember another shot.
[3234.20 - 3236.20] P:1437.65 E:0.107212 |  I know De Paul had a really tame effort,
[3236.20 - 3238.20] P:1198.45 E:0.093733 |  but that's been the difference,
[3238.20 - 3242.20] P:1208.29 E:0.102300 |  that one moment from the magician.
[3242.20 - 3247.20] P:1343.71 E:0.125317 |  Yeah, look, I don't agree with Chris, you know, what he just said.
[3247.20 - 3249.20] P:1289.88 E:0.116483 |  It's just like, it's almost like,
[3249.20 - 3251.20] P:1319.19 E:0.112742 |  we said it before, the game kicked off,
[3251.20 - 3253.20] P:1057.17 E:0.126509 |  we already said he's going to get a moment,
[3253.20 - 3255.20] P:1371.16 E:0.119219 |  and you see him scaling before he gets the ball.
[3255.20 - 3257.20] P:1123.33 E:0.112107 |  And then the moment when he gets the ball,
[3257.20 - 3259.20] P:1449.60 E:0.107474 |  it's almost like he gives him a, like,
[3259.20 - 3261.20] P:1197.63 E:0.112558 |  we call it now a no-loop pass.
[3261.20 - 3263.20] P:1481.50 E:0.120498 |  Like, he's not even watching him clearly,
[3263.20 - 3265.20] P:1587.15 E:0.107943 |  but he already saw him from before.
[3265.20 - 3267.20] P:1217.78 E:0.125862 |  And that's why, when you look at Holland,
[3267.20 - 3269.20] P:1534.00 E:0.104932 |  I think the biggest problem we'll be having now
[3269.20 - 3271.20] P:1329.78 E:0.124156 |  is that we are not dangerous up front enough.
[3271.20 - 3273.20] P:1487.75 E:0.113737 |  Why are we not dangerous enough?
[3273.20 - 3275.20] P:1272.93 E:0.116415 |  Is because in the middle of the park,
[3275.20 - 3277.20] P:1422.01 E:0.110203 |  there's a lot of people that are worried about
[3277.20 - 3279.20] P:1254.07 E:0.122820 |  if he can close the line with the ball towards Messi,
[3279.20 - 3281.20] P:1602.08 E:0.111438 |  and he has to do a lot more backtracking
[3281.20 - 3283.20] P:1728.66 E:0.104223 |  than the other way around.
[3283.20 - 3285.20] P:1723.12 E:0.106009 |  And I think the two strikers up front,
[3285.20 - 3287.20] P:1133.29 E:0.122919 |  how many danger have they created yet?
[3287.20 - 3289.20] P:1422.82 E:0.093565 |  You know, Berg, Ryan and De Pye,
[3289.20 - 3291.20] P:1191.73 E:0.107714 |  because I think they so focus on how we can lock them up,
[3291.20 - 3293.20] P:1156.19 E:0.116359 |  and so they become a disadvantage, Argentina.
[3293.20 - 3295.20] P:1454.45 E:0.102462 |  But Argentina is only waiting to see,
[3295.20 - 3297.20] P:1274.11 E:0.116788 |  like, when can we get Messi on the ball
[3297.20 - 3299.20] P:1372.17 E:0.111100 |  to get him close to the goal,
[3299.20 - 3301.20] P:1313.07 E:0.116650 |  because that's how they set up.
[3301.20 - 3303.20] P:1168.16 E:0.105524 |  They set up to wait, wait, wait,
[3303.20 - 3305.20] P:1311.12 E:0.110533 |  wait until they get them to a position
[3305.20 - 3307.20] P:1493.12 E:0.103900 |  where they can influence Messi.
[3307.20 - 3309.20] P:1298.59 E:0.092852 |  And the rest of the team,
[3309.20 - 3311.20] P:1443.64 E:0.114018 |  they just work for him like we said it before.
[3311.20 - 3313.20] P:1486.99 E:0.097577 |  So I feel Holland has to do a lot more.
[3313.20 - 3315.20] P:1541.20 E:0.113309 |  Dumfries did some stuff,
[3315.20 - 3317.20] P:1203.30 E:0.106661 |  but I haven't seen Blin yet
[3317.20 - 3319.20] P:1504.72 E:0.077944 |  trying to attack the game.
[3319.20 - 3321.20] P:1761.47 E:0.097973 |  Mario, thank you very much for now,
[3321.20 - 3323.20] P:1422.14 E:0.101372 |  Mario, Milioc, Chris Sutton,
[3323.20 - 3325.20] P:1504.53 E:0.112915 |  where there's alongside Ian Denison in the Lusail stadium.
[3325.20 - 3327.20] P:1312.01 E:0.102318 |  We're going to have lots more reaction
[3327.20 - 3329.20] P:1450.77 E:0.092373 |  from Brazil's defeat at the hands of Croatia.
[3329.20 - 3331.20] P:1601.75 E:0.097504 |  They went out on penalties
[3331.20 - 3333.20] P:1579.28 E:0.087441 |  in the early kickoff,
[3333.20 - 3335.20] P:1740.70 E:0.084378 |  and that means that Croatia will face
[3335.20 - 3337.20] P:1140.10 E:0.103067 |  the winner of this game between Netherlands and Argentina.
[3337.20 - 3339.20] P:1676.57 E:0.097076 |  Tomorrow it's all about the other side of the draw.
[3339.20 - 3341.20] P:1378.47 E:0.100794 |  First of all, it's Morocco against Portugal,
[3341.20 - 3343.20] P:1354.01 E:0.084272 |  and we'll hear from Garis Southgate
[3343.20 - 3345.20] P:1497.96 E:0.106337 |  on England's game against France

[3375.20 - 3377.20] P:1683.35 E:0.113553 |  that were implemented after the recession
[3377.20 - 3379.20] P:1799.75 E:0.099163 |  more than a decade ago.

[3429.20 - 3431.20] P:1603.31 E:0.108287 |  by a goal to nail it came from Alina
[3431.20 - 3433.20] P:1526.08 E:0.096580 |  the assist, the beautiful assist
[3433.20 - 3435.20] P:1512.89 E:0.092275 |  was from Leonel Messi.

[3443.20 - 3445.20] P:1710.34 E:0.089154 |  they knocked Brazil out on penalties.
[3445.20 - 3447.20] P:1365.28 E:0.093369 |  We'll get more on that

[3451.20 - 3453.20] P:1591.58 E:0.104357 |  on day one of the second task between
[3453.20 - 3455.20] P:1614.17 E:0.086620 |  Pakistan and England, leg spinner
[3455.20 - 3457.20] P:1650.42 E:0.084371 |  Abra Ahmad took the best figures
[3457.20 - 3459.20] P:1645.41 E:0.086067 |  by any spinner on his test debut
[3459.20 - 3461.20] P:1603.47 E:0.088928 |  with seven for 114.
[3461.20 - 3463.20] P:1695.63 E:0.081382 |  The host bowled out England for 28
[3463.20 - 3465.20] P:1699.09 E:0.075606 |  and it meant by the end of the day
[3465.20 - 3467.20] P:1546.46 E:0.105583 |  they'd trailed by just 174 runs
[3467.20 - 3469.20] P:1712.39 E:0.086639 |  and ended on 172.
[3469.20 - 3471.20] P:1567.65 E:0.082242 |  Now that was in stark contrast
[3471.20 - 3473.20] P:1586.69 E:0.090988 |  to the opening day of the first test
[3473.20 - 3475.20] P:1414.48 E:0.089091 |  and the unresponsive pitch
[3475.20 - 3477.20] P:1590.41 E:0.082910 |  in Ralf Pindi. Jonathan Agby
[3477.20 - 3479.20] P:1515.18 E:0.101015 |  was watching this one with the TMS team.
[3479.20 - 3481.20] P:1666.80 E:0.093114 |  Yeah, it has been a very different
[3481.20 - 3483.20] P:1991.14 E:0.082842 |  sort of match here, much more even
[3483.20 - 3485.20] P:1661.37 E:0.098582 |  contest between bat and ball
[3485.20 - 3487.20] P:1816.12 E:0.090050 |  which has spun almost from the word go
[3487.20 - 3489.20] P:2127.27 E:0.070112 |  not too much but just enough
[3489.20 - 3491.20] P:1970.26 E:0.080434 |  to suggest that as this pitch wears
[3491.20 - 3493.20] P:2027.60 E:0.070506 |  there's going to be more for the spin bowlers
[3493.20 - 3495.20] P:1858.29 E:0.056984 |  as the game goes on.
[3495.20 - 3497.20] P:1815.38 E:0.102038 |  So spin bowler Alex Hartley
[3497.20 - 3499.20] P:2057.96 E:0.075538 |  sitting alongside me, it's always
[3499.20 - 3501.20] P:1828.55 E:0.074561 |  nice to see something a little different
[3501.20 - 3503.20] P:1765.49 E:0.065198 |  isn't it Alex? It is and that is exactly
[3503.20 - 3505.20] P:1434.57 E:0.068247 |  what Abra is isn't it? He's
[3505.20 - 3507.20] P:1517.73 E:0.094620 |  completely different the way he holds the ball
[3507.20 - 3509.20] P:2009.26 E:0.058125 |  the way he bowls his variations
[3509.20 - 3511.20] P:1796.75 E:0.072974 |  it's just something that we haven't seen before
[3511.20 - 3513.20] P:1598.81 E:0.077987 |  and the fact that spin was brought into
[3513.20 - 3515.20] P:1549.00 E:0.062806 |  play in the ninth over of the game
[3515.20 - 3517.20] P:1802.54 E:0.070017 |  and the first ball beat the outside edge
[3517.20 - 3519.20] P:1853.20 E:0.068629 |  we just knew it was going to be a good day
[3519.20 - 3521.20] P:1677.11 E:0.086178 |  we thought the wicket was going to spin
[3521.20 - 3523.20] P:1616.55 E:0.078047 |  they rolled it in a really peculiar way
[3523.20 - 3525.20] P:1775.28 E:0.061637 |  they put grass cuttings, dead grass cuttings
[3525.20 - 3527.20] P:1723.69 E:0.069691 |  at each end of the pitch and rolled them sideways
[3527.20 - 3529.20] P:1760.62 E:0.078654 |  so we knew the pitch was going to offer
[3529.20 - 3531.20] P:1718.38 E:0.065690 |  something not necessarily as much as it did
[3531.20 - 3533.20] P:1882.29 E:0.086316 |  I just love the look on Ben Stokes' face too
[3533.20 - 3535.20] P:1786.53 E:0.085274 |  I mean he had that ball absolutely covered
[3535.20 - 3537.20] P:1965.80 E:0.058378 |  as far as he was concerned
[3537.20 - 3539.20] P:1615.23 E:0.079285 |  and when he heard it hit the stumps
[3539.20 - 3541.20] P:1953.79 E:0.071511 |  I mean his jaw just dropped. He did have
[3541.20 - 3543.20] P:1469.23 E:0.079699 |  never seen Ben Stokes look so surprised
[3543.20 - 3545.20] P:1853.49 E:0.060104 |  we've seen him in the last few test matches
[3545.20 - 3547.20] P:1671.39 E:0.071583 |  he's played laugh when he gets out because
[3547.20 - 3549.20] P:1922.16 E:0.072331 |  he's been playing some expansive shots
[3549.20 - 3551.20] P:1735.80 E:0.070220 |  he was trying to defend this ball from Abra
[3551.20 - 3553.20] P:1900.55 E:0.052943 |  and it literally went through his defences
[3553.20 - 3555.20] P:1793.68 E:0.080698 |  Abra said after the game that that was
[3555.20 - 3557.20] P:1544.99 E:0.075254 |  his favourite wicket and rightly so
[3557.20 - 3559.20] P:1561.23 E:0.068810 |  but also because Ben Stokes is his favourite player
[3559.20 - 3561.20] P:1857.26 E:0.076954 |  well there you go
[3561.20 - 3563.20] P:1810.40 E:0.062360 |  just thinking you know England 117 for 1
[3563.20 - 3565.20] P:1894.84 E:0.070193 |  ok they were still pushing along
[3565.20 - 3567.20] P:1987.37 E:0.058647 |  playing this very positive
[3567.20 - 3569.20] P:1741.98 E:0.077816 |  game that they played
[3569.20 - 3571.20] P:1538.05 E:0.078121 |  to be 117 for 1, 281 all out
[3571.20 - 3573.20] P:1721.78 E:0.083639 |  they'd have wanted more than that
[3573.20 - 3575.20] P:1768.87 E:0.055443 |  were they batting first in these conditions?
[3575.20 - 3577.20] P:1600.80 E:0.089934 |  yeah of course they would have wanted more
[3577.20 - 3579.20] P:1507.43 E:0.079029 |  I think you're right saying 350
[3579.20 - 3581.20] P:1806.57 E:0.072329 |  they would have taken probably anywhere between
[3581.20 - 3583.20] P:1877.11 E:0.066316 |  330 to 350 so they have fallen short
[3583.20 - 3585.20] P:1506.26 E:0.078235 |  by surprise the most is that Mark Wood
[3585.20 - 3587.20] P:1552.13 E:0.063937 |  at the bottom of the order was actually going along
[3587.20 - 3589.20] P:1873.70 E:0.067685 |  really nicely and he was finding the boundary
[3589.20 - 3591.20] P:1971.15 E:0.067267 |  with ease and then Jack Leach
[3591.20 - 3593.20] P:1597.14 E:0.078606 |  his first ball he played the reverse sweep shot
[3593.20 - 3595.20] P:1802.05 E:0.071523 |  and got bold and then Jimmy Anderson
[3595.20 - 3597.20] P:1660.46 E:0.074605 |  you can sort of forgive Jimmy a little bit more
[3597.20 - 3599.20] P:1856.97 E:0.069705 |  because it's his genuine scoring shot
[3599.20 - 3601.20] P:1881.62 E:0.066947 |  he plays it time and time again but you think
[3601.20 - 3603.20] P:1370.47 E:0.073502 |  if you're trying to get up in around 300
[3603.20 - 3605.20] P:1919.72 E:0.067605 |  when you feel like you're could be
[3605.20 - 3607.20] P:1800.85 E:0.073917 |  slightly short on what is a tricky wicket
[3607.20 - 3609.20] P:1812.98 E:0.079236 |  could somebody have just stayed around with
[3609.20 - 3611.20] P:1602.98 E:0.082484 |  Mark Wood a little bit longer?
[3611.20 - 3613.20] P:1516.40 E:0.063439 |  I think at the moment then Alex
[3613.20 - 3615.20] P:2067.26 E:0.085471 |  Barba remains on 61
[3615.20 - 3617.20] P:1658.42 E:0.081243 |  they've dropped Azar Ali their most
[3617.20 - 3619.20] P:1990.40 E:0.053718 |  experienced test batsman
[3619.20 - 3621.20] P:1641.20 E:0.088519 |  which is well it gives others a chance
[3621.20 - 3623.20] P:1845.08 E:0.063621 |  but maybe a bit of a surprise so early
[3623.20 - 3625.20] P:1775.55 E:0.093878 |  in the series where are they going? 174
[3625.20 - 3627.20] P:1842.54 E:0.044913 |  still quite a lot of runs to get
[3627.20 - 3629.20] P:1473.61 E:0.064737 |  yeah they've still got quite a lot of runs to get
[3629.20 - 3631.20] P:1478.93 E:0.086535 |  if England can pick up early wickets tomorrow
[3631.20 - 3633.20] P:1905.74 E:0.044515 |  spin's going to be key so I think we're going to
[3633.20 - 3635.20] P:1643.76 E:0.066186 |  see a lot of Jack Leach, Joe Root
[3635.20 - 3637.20] P:1605.33 E:0.055273 |  and Jacks I think we're going to see
[3637.20 - 3639.20] P:1266.13 E:0.092225 |  then bowl a lot we might see Mark Wood
[3639.20 - 3641.20] P:1791.33 E:0.085516 |  bowl in short sharp spells but what they'll be
[3641.20 - 3643.20] P:1756.78 E:0.067674 |  looking to do is to break this
[3643.20 - 3645.20] P:1803.90 E:0.073965 |  partnership that has been building
[3645.20 - 3647.20] P:1806.07 E:0.072084 |  you know that once you get this wicket and then
[3647.20 - 3649.20] P:1388.77 E:0.084176 |  you get the wicket of Mohammed Rizwan
[3649.20 - 3651.20] P:1510.63 E:0.070255 |  you really are into their all rounders
[3651.20 - 3653.20] P:1745.29 E:0.071656 |  their tail they've got a long tail just
[3653.20 - 3655.20] P:1768.96 E:0.068474 |  like England have in this test match so
[3655.20 - 3657.20] P:1749.06 E:0.065171 |  for me I think it's pretty evenly poised
[3657.20 - 3659.20] P:1789.50 E:0.086582 |  though it looks like spin will be
[3659.20 - 3661.20] P:1511.95 E:0.069591 |  king we'll find out tomorrow
[3661.20 - 3663.20] P:1611.17 E:0.094811 |  I guess thank you very much England
[3663.20 - 3665.20] P:1432.07 E:0.089361 |  then bowled out for 128 today
[3665.20 - 3667.20] P:1272.97 E:0.084475 |  live ball by ball commentary of the
[3667.20 - 3669.20] P:1522.77 E:0.097677 |  day is already a five sports extra
[3669.20 - 3671.20] P:1457.57 E:0.089795 |  from 440 in the morning
[3671.20 - 3673.20] P:1661.43 E:0.078389 |  all the reaction of course is on the
[3673.20 - 3675.20] P:1529.32 E:0.084737 |  TMS podcast on BBC sounds
[3675.20 - 3677.20] P:1590.86 E:0.092373 |  at the World Cup Brazil are

[3679.20 - 3681.20] P:1467.11 E:0.096905 |  who will play the winner of Netherlands
[3681.20 - 3683.20] P:1477.18 E:0.090247 |  against Argentina Argentina
[3683.20 - 3685.20] P:1418.58 E:0.081401 |  a one-nil up at half time second half commentary coming up
[3685.20 - 3687.20] P:1456.99 E:0.072036 |  tomorrow it's Morocco

[3689.20 - 3691.20] P:1521.06 E:0.085690 |  England against France
[3691.20 - 3693.20] P:1351.82 E:0.086721 |  commentary of five live and
[3693.20 - 3695.20] P:1392.66 E:0.079186 |  BBC sounds from seven o'clock
[3695.20 - 3697.20] P:1489.75 E:0.095877 |  and we've been inside the England camp again today
[3697.20 - 3699.20] P:1620.20 E:0.090393 |  our correspondent John Murray caught up
[3699.20 - 3701.20] P:1672.13 E:0.095962 |  with Garis Southgate and he's looking ahead to a huge game
[3701.20 - 3703.20] P:1588.35 E:0.095228 |  Garis I think from the outside
[3703.20 - 3705.20] P:1586.96 E:0.067458 |  this has got an almost an epic
[3705.20 - 3707.20] P:1612.78 E:0.045997 |  feel to it
[3707.20 - 3709.20] P:1479.04 E:0.088132 |  I'm sure that hasn't escaped you on the inside either
[3709.20 - 3711.20] P:1541.44 E:0.072496 |  so how do you deal with that
[3711.20 - 3713.20] P:1650.64 E:0.075709 |  to be honest we're preparing for it like every game
[3713.20 - 3715.20] P:1473.05 E:0.072208 |  we prepare for of course we're
[3715.20 - 3717.20] P:1516.83 E:0.052099 |  one step further in the tournament
[3717.20 - 3719.20] P:1467.63 E:0.065247 |  and we're playing an
[3719.20 - 3721.20] P:1452.85 E:0.079161 |  opponent with increased quality so
[3721.20 - 3723.20] P:1253.93 E:0.085827 |  we can't be naive about how we prepare
[3723.20 - 3725.20] P:1296.54 E:0.070831 |  you've got to make the players aware of
[3725.20 - 3727.20] P:1606.33 E:0.059948 |  specific challenges
[3727.20 - 3729.20] P:1721.56 E:0.088933 |  they'll face in any game and of course
[3729.20 - 3731.20] P:1440.51 E:0.076169 |  this opponent has
[3731.20 - 3733.20] P:1341.14 E:0.073697 |  a couple of individuals that
[3733.20 - 3735.20] P:1717.70 E:0.082071 |  you can quite clearly identify
[3735.20 - 3737.20] P:1478.51 E:0.076018 |  where their strengths are but in terms of
[3737.20 - 3739.20] P:1800.22 E:0.075869 |  the preparation for the game
[3739.20 - 3741.20] P:1381.87 E:0.078437 |  it's been a normal week for us
[3741.20 - 3743.20] P:1855.03 E:0.076844 |  you know the balance of recovery
[3743.20 - 3745.20] P:1761.50 E:0.086435 |  relaxation good focus
[3745.20 - 3747.20] P:1807.16 E:0.088245 |  to training and the meetings
[3747.20 - 3749.20] P:1538.45 E:0.079819 |  and preparing and tapering nicely
[3749.20 - 3751.20] P:1805.94 E:0.074618 |  for tomorrow
[3751.20 - 3753.20] P:1519.94 E:0.076242 |  is the 243 still a consideration
[3753.20 - 3755.20] P:1329.22 E:0.077470 |  or has the
[3755.20 - 3757.20] P:1508.26 E:0.084074 |  way that it's worked with the midfield
[3757.20 - 3759.20] P:1625.95 E:0.073356 |  3
[3759.20 - 3761.20] P:1373.78 E:0.091623 |  has that been a little bit of a game changer for you
[3761.20 - 3763.20] P:1569.36 E:0.055944 |  I think what we've always
[3763.20 - 3765.20] P:1457.93 E:0.077455 |  wanted to do with the team
[3765.20 - 3767.20] P:1653.46 E:0.067750 |  is the job is to win football matches
[3767.20 - 3769.20] P:1632.51 E:0.067301 |  and to find the best way
[3769.20 - 3771.20] P:1595.73 E:0.089119 |  of playing with the players that you have
[3771.20 - 3773.20] P:1590.57 E:0.058892 |  in Russia we felt we did that
[3773.20 - 3775.20] P:1637.40 E:0.073714 |  since then we've wanted to be
[3775.20 - 3777.20] P:1583.21 E:0.070849 |  flexible because
[3777.20 - 3779.20] P:1670.90 E:0.069961 |  tactically you can face different opponents
[3779.20 - 3781.20] P:1109.29 E:0.082802 |  that cause you a tactical problem
[3781.20 - 3783.20] P:1887.41 E:0.081693 |  and that's the challenge we've had
[3783.20 - 3785.20] P:1748.87 E:0.082978 |  for every game in this tournament what's the best way
[3785.20 - 3787.20] P:1384.25 E:0.059680 |  with the players that we have
[3787.20 - 3789.20] P:1409.26 E:0.077206 |  to deal with the opponent that we're facing
[3789.20 - 3791.20] P:1513.17 E:0.071035 |  you can have a philosophy
[3791.20 - 3793.20] P:1685.37 E:0.068091 |  but you've got to win football matches
[3793.20 - 3795.20] P:1562.65 E:0.089435 |  and it's no use having a philosophy
[3795.20 - 3797.20] P:1548.21 E:0.075423 |  if you're on the plane home so
[3797.20 - 3799.20] P:1605.26 E:0.080682 |  we've always tried to find that balance
[3799.20 - 3801.20] P:1691.59 E:0.072955 |  that balance has been good so far
[3801.20 - 3803.20] P:1424.45 E:0.074543 |  in this tournament and that's the decision
[3803.20 - 3805.20] P:1356.13 E:0.095756 |  we've got to get right or one of the decisions
[3805.20 - 3807.20] P:1535.28 E:0.064849 |  we've got to get right ahead of tomorrow's game
[3809.20 - 3811.20] P:1762.70 E:0.090930 |  Southgate talking ahead of England's match against
[3811.20 - 3813.20] P:1373.85 E:0.108493 |  France and there will be loads of
[3813.20 - 3815.20] P:1528.38 E:0.098401 |  build up as you would imagine on 5 live
[3815.20 - 3817.20] P:1690.38 E:0.077976 |  sports the stars tomorrow morning
[3817.20 - 3819.20] P:1616.13 E:0.093355 |  Rick Edwards is joined by Emma Saunders
[3819.20 - 3821.20] P:1745.03 E:0.077943 |  to start the build up to that one
[3821.20 - 3823.20] P:1707.38 E:0.078100 |  so tournament favourites
[3823.20 - 3825.20] P:1655.39 E:0.089573 |  Brazil are out of the World Cup
[3825.20 - 3827.20] P:1875.91 E:0.086852 |  they lost 4-2 on penalties to Croatia
[3827.20 - 3829.20] P:1740.70 E:0.082633 |  Marquinhos hit the post with the
[3829.20 - 3831.20] P:1829.27 E:0.077975 |  fourth spot cake for Brazil
[3831.20 - 3833.20] P:1580.75 E:0.089915 |  and this is how that moment went
[3833.20 - 3835.20] P:1783.97 E:0.062013 |  with the Brazilian commentary team
[3839.20 - 3841.20] P:1463.44 E:0.119488 |  the dream of the ex-campeonato
[3841.20 - 3843.20] P:1520.81 E:0.104425 |  goes to Marquinhos
[3843.20 - 3845.20] P:1443.25 E:0.111206 |  he's in the lead
[3845.20 - 3847.20] P:1469.74 E:0.105979 |  Croatia is in the lead
[3847.20 - 3849.20] P:1388.26 E:0.117992 |  with a lot of football to be the final
[3849.20 - 3851.20] P:1332.16 E:0.116174 |  of the World Cup
[3851.20 - 3853.20] P:1391.39 E:0.117360 |  Brazil is out of the competition
[3855.20 - 3857.20] P:1398.17 E:0.103538 |  Let's speak now to Fernando Eduardo
[3857.20 - 3859.20] P:1708.21 E:0.084497 |  a Brazilian football journalist from the
[3859.20 - 3861.20] P:2016.37 E:0.091776 |  BBC's World Service
[3861.20 - 3863.20] P:1813.67 E:0.091140 |  Fernando should this one even have got
[3863.20 - 3865.20] P:1662.93 E:0.097427 |  to penalties should Brazil have got this game
[3865.20 - 3867.20] P:1913.65 E:0.068385 |  done in 90 minutes
[3867.20 - 3869.20] P:1835.11 E:0.073199 |  Brazil should have wrapped it up
[3869.20 - 3871.20] P:1625.28 E:0.085277 |  after Neymar scored
[3871.20 - 3873.20] P:1813.39 E:0.063934 |  the goal
[3873.20 - 3875.20] P:1772.18 E:0.086043 |  right at the dying end
[3875.20 - 3877.20] P:1840.26 E:0.075649 |  of the first half of the extra time
[3877.20 - 3879.20] P:1754.61 E:0.087501 |  Brazil were naive and they paid for it
[3879.20 - 3881.20] P:2127.27 E:0.047367 |  in what way do you think they were naive
[3881.20 - 3883.20] P:2004.11 E:0.057671 |  well
[3883.20 - 3885.20] P:1816.33 E:0.086216 |  5 minutes ago
[3885.20 - 3887.20] P:1765.68 E:0.084150 |  instead of trying to attack Croatia
[3887.20 - 3889.20] P:1873.01 E:0.076618 |  instead of trying to
[3889.20 - 3891.20] P:1592.17 E:0.088647 |  attack Voguellas Blades
[3891.20 - 3893.20] P:1590.23 E:0.079753 |  they should have held the ball up front
[3893.20 - 3895.20] P:1460.57 E:0.073715 |  they gave Croatia counter attack
[3895.20 - 3897.20] P:1487.10 E:0.079540 |  it was ridiculous
[3897.20 - 3899.20] P:1321.31 E:0.091304 |  Fred the defensive midfielder
[3899.20 - 3901.20] P:1249.12 E:0.076866 |  was on the right wing when the play happened
[3901.20 - 3903.20] P:1363.63 E:0.083267 |  so
[3903.20 - 3905.20] P:1550.68 E:0.076748 |  they paid the price for basically not
[3905.20 - 3907.20] P:1718.53 E:0.084671 |  really controlling the game
[3907.20 - 3909.20] P:1766.36 E:0.080282 |  it's that simple football
[3909.20 - 3911.20] P:1630.38 E:0.059380 |  is played on the pitch and Brazil were naive
[3911.20 - 3913.20] P:1749.66 E:0.103380 |  when you look at the performance
[3913.20 - 3915.20] P:1687.02 E:0.101409 |  of Lovakovic in the Croatia goal
[3915.20 - 3917.20] P:1480.95 E:0.076434 |  he made 11 saves
[3917.20 - 3919.20] P:1633.39 E:0.091148 |  no goalkeepers made more at this tournament
[3919.20 - 3921.20] P:1617.50 E:0.080752 |  can you put some of the
[3921.20 - 3923.20] P:1504.98 E:0.094947 |  inability of Brazil to score
[3923.20 - 3925.20] P:1654.99 E:0.088635 |  a decisive goal down to his good performance
[3925.20 - 3927.20] P:1349.83 E:0.069063 |  yes
[3927.20 - 3929.20] P:1269.69 E:0.094101 |  at normal time
[3929.20 - 3931.20] P:1537.75 E:0.086482 |  he was incredible
[3931.20 - 3933.20] P:1599.98 E:0.083152 |  but after extra time
[3933.20 - 3935.20] P:1829.44 E:0.074835 |  when Neymar scored that amazing goal
[3935.20 - 3937.20] P:1588.84 E:0.096224 |  it was Brazil's game they should have controlled it much better
[3937.20 - 3939.20] P:1732.03 E:0.062067 |  and they did it and they lost

[4159.20 - 4161.20] P:1571.70 E:0.112506 |  towards the corner flat
[4161.20 - 4163.20] P:1413.03 E:0.106982 |  and
[4163.20 - 4165.20] P:1565.33 E:0.108754 |  despite his best efforts

[4229.20 - 4231.20] P:1291.49 E:0.091915 |  as Gakpo

[4261.20 - 4263.20] P:1413.92 E:0.078010 |  got to find a way
[4263.20 - 4265.20] P:1597.97 E:0.104537 |  of getting him on the ball
[4265.20 - 4267.20] P:1599.74 E:0.106474 |  and dictating

[4285.20 - 4287.20] P:1667.31 E:0.114085 |  and eventually he says he was being pulled back

[4289.20 - 4291.20] P:1825.55 E:0.121099 |  and the referee

[4297.20 - 4299.20] P:1881.59 E:0.107173 |  he's furious, he's now
[4299.20 - 4301.20] P:1710.45 E:0.104306 |  lambasting the official on the far side
[4301.20 - 4303.20] P:1671.90 E:0.101916 |  but he just wasn't strong enough
[4303.20 - 4305.20] P:1457.72 E:0.091771 |  I was getting more worried
[4305.20 - 4307.20] P:1670.48 E:0.113728 |  from a Cunha's point of view because he's on a yellow card
[4307.20 - 4309.20] P:1654.99 E:0.106039 |  and I thought with this referee
[4309.20 - 4311.20] P:1652.05 E:0.107947 |  you could take no chances
[4311.20 - 4313.20] P:1512.94 E:0.104545 |  sure if he said you'll get a second yellow card
[4313.20 - 4315.20] P:1610.12 E:0.113795 |  and you're off, he's already missing the
[4315.20 - 4317.20] P:1659.49 E:0.101031 |  semi-final against Croatia
[4317.20 - 4319.20] P:1652.33 E:0.107082 |  if indeed Argentina do go through
[4319.20 - 4321.20] P:1687.57 E:0.107234 |  lovely little touch by Messi
[4321.20 - 4323.20] P:1720.46 E:0.108989 |  McAllister appeared to be impeded
[4323.20 - 4325.20] P:1858.98 E:0.116581 |  Scoloni certainly thought so as well
[4327.20 - 4329.20] P:1700.87 E:0.114950 |  instead he goes out of play
[4329.20 - 4331.20] P:1561.48 E:0.106384 |  and it will be a throw to the Netherlands
[4331.20 - 4333.20] P:1689.55 E:0.095485 |  daily blint towards
[4333.20 - 4335.20] P:1567.09 E:0.093628 |  Cope Miners, back now to

[4337.20 - 4339.20] P:1586.37 E:0.112448 |  they're passing the ball a little quicker now
[4339.20 - 4341.20] P:1493.99 E:0.089995 |  than Dutch
[4341.20 - 4343.20] P:1622.33 E:0.106152 |  a little
[4343.20 - 4345.20] P:1662.61 E:0.114377 |  they have to, don't they?
[4345.20 - 4347.20] P:1746.25 E:0.102183 |  they're going to be in emergency
[4347.20 - 4349.20] P:1798.79 E:0.111181 |  McAllister charges down
[4349.20 - 4351.20] P:1735.55 E:0.119001 |  Cope Miners clearance to Paul with a through
[4351.20 - 4353.20] P:1751.78 E:0.106738 |  Paul, Messi now side the penalty area
[4353.20 - 4355.20] P:1760.38 E:0.109731 |  and he saw
[4355.20 - 4357.20] P:1720.69 E:0.113274 |  that Nopper was sliding off his goal
[4357.20 - 4359.20] P:1592.02 E:0.111324 |  and in the end Messi didn't even go for it
[4359.20 - 4361.20] P:1680.04 E:0.117373 |  if it to Paul should be making that pass
[4361.20 - 4363.20] P:1565.31 E:0.107002 |  Messi had made the run in that right-hand channel
[4363.20 - 4365.20] P:1648.30 E:0.092304 |  just heavy
[4365.20 - 4367.20] P:1565.64 E:0.112238 |  too heavy the pass was
[4367.20 - 4369.20] P:1511.79 E:0.082005 |  and Nopper
[4369.20 - 4371.20] P:1641.80 E:0.107946 |  had to be alert, was alert
[4371.20 - 4373.20] P:1411.63 E:0.085126 |  came out his
[4373.20 - 4375.20] P:1444.93 E:0.098225 |  big sprawling
[4375.20 - 4377.20] P:1401.75 E:0.109218 |  6 for 8 frame, gathering the ball
[4379.20 - 4381.20] P:1857.36 E:0.108100 |  here is
[4381.20 - 4383.20] P:1630.07 E:0.113567 |  De Jong, midway through
[4383.20 - 4385.20] P:1679.28 E:0.111858 |  the Argentina half
[4385.20 - 4387.20] P:1678.73 E:0.105578 |  you're listening to BBC Radio 5 Live
[4387.20 - 4389.20] P:1553.10 E:0.104709 |  where Argentina are leading by a goal to Nill
[4389.20 - 4391.20] P:1542.94 E:0.097050 |  in this World Cup quarterfinal
[4391.20 - 4393.20] P:1665.78 E:0.094803 |  De Jong forward of the centre circle
[4395.20 - 4397.20] P:1464.40 E:0.091899 |  the pie
[4397.20 - 4399.20] P:1704.15 E:0.095096 |  goes away from him
[4399.20 - 4401.20] P:1716.62 E:0.113404 |  picks up by McAllister
[4401.20 - 4403.20] P:1664.46 E:0.104600 |  he's got Alvarez to his left
[4407.20 - 4409.20] P:1708.91 E:0.125614 |  Vincenzo gets it out towards the right-hand side
[4409.20 - 4411.20] P:1524.95 E:0.107567 |  Molina's return ball from De Paul
[4411.20 - 4413.20] P:1597.74 E:0.100624 |  the move has slowed down considerably
[4413.20 - 4415.20] P:1528.89 E:0.100414 |  now for Argentina although they have retained possession
[4415.20 - 4417.20] P:1590.72 E:0.101433 |  he could have gone out left
[4417.20 - 4419.20] P:1526.31 E:0.105271 |  Alvarez who had made a decent run
[4419.20 - 4421.20] P:1666.38 E:0.100043 |  but the pie gave away the ball
[4421.20 - 4423.20] P:1619.27 E:0.089053 |  and then he gave
[4423.20 - 4427.20] P:1589.78 E:0.107183 |  a piece of his mind screaming at him
[4427.20 - 4429.20] P:1451.71 E:0.111481 |  you've got a show for me, you've got to help me out
[4431.20 - 4433.20] P:1591.28 E:0.108978 |  they're looking for a fifth World Cup semi-final
[4435.20 - 4437.20] P:1077.92 E:0.105383 |  although remember in 78
[4437.20 - 4439.20] P:1467.35 E:0.108965 |  they progressed to the final
[4439.20 - 4441.20] P:1426.41 E:0.095832 |  via a second round stage
[4441.20 - 4443.20] P:1345.12 E:0.100801 |  so sometimes little stats like that
[4443.20 - 4445.20] P:1498.80 E:0.109481 |  can be misleading as the way
[4445.20 - 4447.20] P:1569.58 E:0.102047 |  that the competition has evolved
[4447.20 - 4449.20] P:1668.12 E:0.087662 |  over the years
[4449.20 - 4451.20] P:1726.66 E:0.085351 |  but certainly
[4451.20 - 4453.20] P:1677.81 E:0.102199 |  the two times winners
[4453.20 - 4455.20] P:1485.46 E:0.083452 |  Argentina
[4455.20 - 4457.20] P:1698.79 E:0.093893 |  looking for a last four date
[4457.20 - 4459.20] P:1747.89 E:0.110265 |  with Croatia
[4459.20 - 4461.20] P:1680.81 E:0.104773 |  if they can manage this second half
[4463.20 - 4465.20] P:1574.89 E:0.108681 |  protect this slender lead
[4465.20 - 4467.20] P:1364.49 E:0.093583 |  that they have
[4469.20 - 4471.20] P:1582.49 E:0.110572 |  Birkhouse is certainly
[4471.20 - 4473.20] P:1541.77 E:0.108798 |  Birkus is certainly going a little bit more
[4473.20 - 4475.20] P:1495.24 E:0.100508 |  through the middle isn't he
[4475.20 - 4477.20] P:1474.23 E:0.109372 |  yeah
[4477.20 - 4479.20] P:1664.54 E:0.106943 |  he's set up
[4479.20 - 4481.20] P:1437.44 E:0.096893 |  it's just the way
[4481.20 - 4483.20] P:1410.61 E:0.122175 |  that has panned out this particular move
[4483.20 - 4485.20] P:1572.26 E:0.102455 |  he's on the ball now
[4485.20 - 4487.20] P:1690.08 E:0.106116 |  Birkus to Gakpo looking to turn
[4487.20 - 4489.20] P:1639.80 E:0.098517 |  and he's going to go on to the pie behind him
[4489.20 - 4491.20] P:1815.01 E:0.105046 |  Blint with a cross
[4491.20 - 4493.20] P:1888.90 E:0.108970 |  it's a poor, poor cross
[4493.20 - 4495.20] P:1808.79 E:0.116394 |  maybe Blint
[4495.20 - 4497.20] P:1845.71 E:0.119615 |  he's been really ineffective hasn't he
[4499.20 - 4501.20] P:1510.65 E:0.117552 |  he's got the marauding
[4501.20 - 4503.20] P:1568.20 E:0.092656 |  Dumfries on the right-hand side
[4503.20 - 4505.20] P:1617.94 E:0.104332 |  but aging
[4505.20 - 4507.20] P:1656.55 E:0.102814 |  maybe Blint doesn't really have
[4507.20 - 4509.20] P:1690.94 E:0.099771 |  the legs anymore
[4509.20 - 4511.20] P:1633.69 E:0.087581 |  32
[4513.20 - 4515.20] P:1671.31 E:0.112013 |  the dominating the ball at the moment
[4515.20 - 4517.20] P:1525.58 E:0.105380 |  nine minutes into the second half
[4517.20 - 4519.20] P:1596.13 E:0.111824 |  De Jong starting to see a lot more of it
[4519.20 - 4521.20] P:1718.66 E:0.104555 |  there was an off the ball
[4521.20 - 4523.20] P:1527.43 E:0.105927 |  shot there by De Paul
[4523.20 - 4525.20] P:1417.69 E:0.112204 |  Argentina have got everybody back behind the ball
[4525.20 - 4527.20] P:1692.97 E:0.109070 |  they're being urged on
[4527.20 - 4529.20] P:1609.01 E:0.105940 |  by this passionate crowd
[4529.20 - 4531.20] P:1533.07 E:0.114180 |  wherever you look the Argentinian support
[4531.20 - 4533.20] P:1628.68 E:0.109016 |  inside this two-tier
[4533.20 - 4535.20] P:1648.52 E:0.098786 |  Lucille Stadium
[4535.20 - 4537.20] P:1520.65 E:0.105304 |  the pie is very, very deep
[4537.20 - 4539.20] P:1428.21 E:0.096183 |  inside the centre circle
[4539.20 - 4541.20] P:1492.28 E:0.111884 |  Coat miners is deep in between
[4541.20 - 4543.20] P:1496.36 E:0.103210 |  some of the central defenders on that far side
[4543.20 - 4545.20] P:1416.11 E:0.103650 |  now they attack on the right
[4545.20 - 4547.20] P:1477.46 E:0.077426 |  Dumfries is staying out wide
[4547.20 - 4549.20] P:1512.08 E:0.111148 |  there was Alvarez back on defensive duties
[4549.20 - 4551.20] P:1699.38 E:0.105576 |  to break it up for Argentina
[4551.20 - 4553.20] P:1504.56 E:0.103788 |  and Alvarez with a ball in field
[4557.20 - 4559.20] P:1734.64 E:0.116471 |  Blint with the interception
[4559.20 - 4561.20] P:1672.57 E:0.118762 |  well he's your book messy here
[4561.20 - 4563.20] P:1635.60 E:0.108601 |  but
[4563.20 - 4565.20] P:1731.76 E:0.102936 |  the referee but
[4565.20 - 4567.20] P:1792.71 E:0.110707 |  you don't get yellows
[4567.20 - 4569.20] P:1752.30 E:0.098741 |  if you've got do you
[4569.20 - 4571.20] P:1598.31 E:0.116970 |  well I mean that's similar
[4571.20 - 4573.20] P:1667.79 E:0.111641 |  to the Romero one isn't it
[4573.20 - 4575.20] P:1653.49 E:0.103235 |  the first half
[4579.20 - 4581.20] P:1769.35 E:0.121985 |  the mess he's asking him for a free kick
[4583.20 - 4585.20] P:1595.74 E:0.119048 |  is that pushing it
[4587.20 - 4589.20] P:1595.98 E:0.106742 |  where is the consistency
[4589.20 - 4591.20] P:1546.60 E:0.110249 |  and I'm not giving you that in Spanish either
[4591.20 - 4593.20] P:1442.91 E:0.110730 |  10 minutes into the second half here
[4593.20 - 4595.20] P:1511.61 E:0.105705 |  on five live
[4595.20 - 4597.20] P:1497.42 E:0.100790 |  Van Dijk
[4597.20 - 4599.20] P:1440.77 E:0.121059 |  Argentina have dropped off
[4599.20 - 4601.20] P:1603.01 E:0.120157 |  nothing's really changed though
[4601.20 - 4603.20] P:1543.26 E:0.097007 |  the Dutch approach
[4603.20 - 4605.20] P:1535.41 E:0.102270 |  centre half's not brave enough
[4605.20 - 4607.20] P:1607.65 E:0.109967 |  to step in when are they going to gamble
[4609.20 - 4611.20] P:1633.01 E:0.093672 |  Australia
[4611.20 - 4613.20] P:1491.66 E:0.114427 |  put Argentina under real
[4613.20 - 4615.20] P:1605.22 E:0.099750 |  pressure and made it quite uncomfortable
[4615.20 - 4617.20] P:1464.96 E:0.090301 |  we wouldn't have necessarily
[4617.20 - 4619.20] P:1625.86 E:0.115601 |  thought that when Argentina
[4619.20 - 4621.20] P:1386.05 E:0.083819 |  were leading by
[4621.20 - 4623.20] P:1434.07 E:0.106889 |  two goals to nail
[4623.20 - 4625.20] P:1297.55 E:0.089326 |  and then all of a sudden we had
[4625.20 - 4627.20] P:1539.16 E:0.106310 |  a rather dramatic finish that was
[4627.20 - 4629.20] P:1360.48 E:0.106059 |  Saturday here we are on this Friday night
[4629.20 - 4631.20] P:1524.32 E:0.100464 |  1-0 to Argentina
[4631.20 - 4633.20] P:1864.00 E:0.102211 |  so the Dutch at some stage
[4633.20 - 4635.20] P:1816.44 E:0.098110 |  will have to
[4635.20 - 4637.20] P:1665.21 E:0.092651 |  have a concerted effort
[4639.20 - 4641.20] P:1827.41 E:0.122932 |  on the Argentinian back line
[4641.20 - 4643.20] P:1699.47 E:0.110002 |  they are seeing a lot of the ball but by and large
[4643.20 - 4645.20] P:1660.09 E:0.105705 |  they're playing in front of Argentina
[4645.20 - 4647.20] P:1432.99 E:0.092571 |  absolutely right
[4647.20 - 4649.20] P:1504.12 E:0.104049 |  Argentina happy to sit deep
[4649.20 - 4651.20] P:1190.14 E:0.098532 |  they're not really
[4651.20 - 4653.20] P:1536.48 E:0.102555 |  able to get out at this moment in time
[4653.20 - 4655.20] P:1661.21 E:0.086408 |  the Dutch pushing
[4655.20 - 4657.20] P:1656.31 E:0.102600 |  Argentina back
[4657.20 - 4659.20] P:1652.29 E:0.095985 |  De Jong having a bit of an influence now
[4661.20 - 4663.20] P:1540.58 E:0.101430 |  De Jong
[4663.20 - 4665.20] P:1673.26 E:0.099333 |  Berkus holds off the challenge
[4665.20 - 4667.20] P:1557.05 E:0.094935 |  plays it to
[4667.20 - 4669.20] P:1294.17 E:0.103752 |  Cope Miners one or the other
[4669.20 - 4671.20] P:1686.96 E:0.092897 |  substitutes
[4671.20 - 4673.20] P:1521.13 E:0.101440 |  Berkus
[4673.20 - 4675.20] P:1539.88 E:0.101252 |  forward ball to Pie
[4675.20 - 4677.20] P:1640.58 E:0.103010 |  to Gakpo
[4677.20 - 4679.20] P:1709.06 E:0.092749 |  there was De Paul
[4679.20 - 4681.20] P:1570.18 E:0.106060 |  the back pass quickly played away by

[5057.20 - 5059.20] P:1777.40 E:0.110364 |  he knows that was tight
[5061.20 - 5063.20] P:1768.27 E:0.099177 |  it's the free kick left hand side of the box
[5065.20 - 5067.20] P:1784.67 E:0.119225 |  he doesn't go over the ball
[5067.20 - 5069.20] P:1805.12 E:0.093419 |  try and beat Nopper
[5069.20 - 5071.20] P:1760.69 E:0.085810 |  with the biggest gap
[5071.20 - 5073.20] P:1708.96 E:0.099626 |  reverses it onto Nopper
[5073.20 - 5075.20] P:1723.13 E:0.083715 |  side but
[5075.20 - 5077.20] P:1713.11 E:0.109754 |  wasn't far away
[5077.20 - 5079.20] P:1743.59 E:0.102104 |  that was a poor clearance by Otter Mende
[5079.20 - 5081.20] P:1702.21 E:0.095440 |  it was a slip then by Verkus
[5081.20 - 5083.20] P:1872.60 E:0.115694 |  and they've lost the ball
[5083.20 - 5085.20] P:1846.87 E:0.110408 |  Cunha on that far side
[5087.20 - 5089.20] P:1733.03 E:0.107702 |  we've got 50,000 Argentinians
[5089.20 - 5091.20] P:1755.91 E:0.108312 |  who will be looking to extend their stay in Doha
[5091.20 - 5093.20] P:1822.30 E:0.109617 |  until at least next Tuesday
[5093.20 - 5095.20] P:1666.98 E:0.093439 |  might be joined by a few thousand more
[5095.20 - 5097.20] P:1734.65 E:0.107090 |  as well to Paul
[5097.20 - 5099.20] P:1686.02 E:0.097751 |  he's done well bearing in mind
[5099.20 - 5101.20] P:1715.26 E:0.098501 |  there was a fitness doubt coming into the game
[5101.20 - 5103.20] P:1647.28 E:0.097505 |  and then actually staying down
[5103.20 - 5105.20] P:1557.02 E:0.123063 |  he's given the ball away
[5105.20 - 5107.20] P:1701.44 E:0.100364 |  that was the curse of the commentator
[5107.20 - 5109.20] P:1617.24 E:0.113085 |  you can apologise to him after
[5113.20 - 5115.20] P:1526.30 E:0.099607 |  ok
[5115.20 - 5117.20] P:1557.88 E:0.107085 |  it's kind of...
[5117.20 - 5119.20] P:1701.33 E:0.081512 |  Flynn's been told to go down
[5119.20 - 5121.20] P:1682.90 E:0.117237 |  I think he's been really
[5121.20 - 5123.20] P:1581.51 E:0.088179 |  ineffective hasn't he
[5123.20 - 5125.20] P:1741.63 E:0.101083 |  that was Danny as well
[5125.20 - 5127.20] P:1590.83 E:0.107647 |  Danny is the assistant coach down there now
[5127.20 - 5129.20] P:1707.44 E:0.108225 |  they're going to make the change
[5129.20 - 5131.20] P:1709.70 E:0.110003 |  it's going to be an attacking change as well
[5133.20 - 5135.20] P:1753.15 E:0.113200 |  so
[5135.20 - 5137.20] P:1465.69 E:0.123888 |  Daily Blitz
[5137.20 - 5139.20] P:1678.62 E:0.108940 |  has come off
[5139.20 - 5141.20] P:1503.99 E:0.117541 |  he's a 99th appearance
[5141.20 - 5143.20] P:1531.76 E:0.098439 |  and
[5143.20 - 5145.20] P:1374.69 E:0.114601 |  coming on
[5145.20 - 5147.20] P:1290.87 E:0.113655 |  is Lupe Dion
[5147.20 - 5149.20] P:1581.63 E:0.114172 |  for his first appearance
[5149.20 - 5151.20] P:1395.08 E:0.105672 |  at this World Cup
[5151.20 - 5153.20] P:1678.23 E:0.111255 |  the 32 year old striker
[5153.20 - 5155.20] P:1465.16 E:0.085429 |  had that
[5155.20 - 5157.20] P:1780.58 E:0.113442 |  and happy loan experience at Newcastle United
[5157.20 - 5159.20] P:1738.30 E:0.115383 |  about eight years ago
[5159.20 - 5161.20] P:2010.63 E:0.114182 |  he's back with BSV
[5165.20 - 5167.20] P:1739.28 E:0.112308 |  I think
[5167.20 - 5169.20] P:1733.68 E:0.107420 |  Vincent Janssen started the first game of the tournament
[5169.20 - 5171.20] P:1714.72 E:0.093778 |  he did
[5171.20 - 5173.20] P:1697.63 E:0.099232 |  then he came on as a sub against Qatar
[5173.20 - 5175.20] P:1684.86 E:0.104589 |  I mean that suggests
[5175.20 - 5177.20] P:1721.37 E:0.104145 |  that the Dutch may go
[5177.20 - 5179.20] P:1617.36 E:0.106239 |  a bit longer that's his game
[5179.20 - 5181.20] P:1596.55 E:0.098163 |  with Dion
[5181.20 - 5183.20] P:1674.83 E:0.094699 |  Argentina are attacking
[5183.20 - 5185.20] P:1757.65 E:0.107199 |  De Paul left hand side of the penalty area
[5185.20 - 5187.20] P:1752.25 E:0.106595 |  still leading by Golden Hill
[5187.20 - 5189.20] P:1641.09 E:0.104070 |  65 minutes played here on BBC Radio 5 Live
[5189.20 - 5191.20] P:1564.30 E:0.100173 |  also available on BBC

[5193.20 - 5195.20] P:1597.37 E:0.101164 |  and all across Africa
[5195.20 - 5197.20] P:1638.03 E:0.106201 |  on the World Service
[5197.20 - 5199.20] P:1883.09 E:0.107632 |  wherever you're listening however you're listening
[5199.20 - 5201.20] P:1851.14 E:0.113311 |  thank you for your company this Friday night
[5203.20 - 5205.20] P:1650.96 E:0.113835 |  and tomorrow
[5205.20 - 5207.20] P:1811.21 E:0.105243 |  Morocco, Portugal and then England, France
[5207.20 - 5209.20] P:1761.21 E:0.104210 |  at 7
[5209.20 - 5211.20] P:1655.50 E:0.094484 |  Argentina are going to be making
[5211.20 - 5213.20] P:1696.75 E:0.113858 |  another change
[5213.20 - 5215.20] P:1751.01 E:0.109276 |  Paradez is going to be coming off
[5215.20 - 5217.20] P:1603.36 E:0.114267 |  Neanderthal Paradez so he's a midfielder
[5219.20 - 5221.20] P:1537.81 E:0.113281 |  and I would think that might be for De Paul
[5221.20 - 5223.20] P:1670.57 E:0.104575 |  Molina tries to
[5223.20 - 5225.20] P:1474.34 E:0.110988 |  rattle a low one in from the right hand side
[5225.20 - 5227.20] P:1676.73 E:0.096255 |  stopped by Ake
[5227.20 - 5229.20] P:1811.78 E:0.117676 |  so Ake's now gone to left back
[5229.20 - 5231.20] P:1506.75 E:0.091739 |  and they switch to a flat back
[5231.20 - 5233.20] P:1780.12 E:0.117208 |  ball haven't they with Van Dijk and Timbers
[5233.20 - 5235.20] P:1817.82 E:0.112345 |  the two central defenders
[5235.20 - 5237.20] P:1716.29 E:0.104513 |  now that
[5237.20 - 5239.20] P:1629.98 E:0.104098 |  Blint's gone off the field
[5241.20 - 5243.20] P:1712.56 E:0.113125 |  it is going to be De Paul who's going to be coming off
[5243.20 - 5245.20] P:1837.89 E:0.104097 |  so that's going to be a like for like change
[5245.20 - 5247.20] P:1932.24 E:0.098357 |  he has done exceptionally well
[5247.20 - 5249.20] P:1919.59 E:0.108466 |  he has
[5249.20 - 5251.20] P:1897.54 E:0.122690 |  especially early on
[5251.20 - 5253.20] P:1919.20 E:0.109969 |  really nullified
[5253.20 - 5255.20] P:1924.47 E:0.121959 |  thank you to Yong in that first half
[5257.20 - 5259.20] P:1862.99 E:0.116679 |  makes him telling runs
[5259.20 - 5261.20] P:1579.55 E:0.119195 |  going forward
[5261.20 - 5263.20] P:1647.24 E:0.117157 |  like for like swap though
[5267.20 - 5269.20] P:1611.74 E:0.111615 |  tells you everything about how the players themselves
[5269.20 - 5271.20] P:1323.63 E:0.110855 |  feel as if it's a home game here
[5273.20 - 5275.20] P:1480.32 E:0.112653 |  such as the huge
[5275.20 - 5277.20] P:1462.18 E:0.112049 |  numbers of Argentinian support
[5277.20 - 5279.20] P:1658.54 E:0.098515 |  the size inside the stadium
[5279.20 - 5281.20] P:1490.92 E:0.101938 |  because he's able to turn around and apport
[5281.20 - 5283.20] P:1682.40 E:0.088489 |  as if he's
[5283.20 - 5285.20] P:1620.60 E:0.090972 |  a home game
[5285.20 - 5287.20] P:1615.59 E:0.104679 |  in your own little stadium
[5287.20 - 5289.20] P:1717.31 E:0.112164 |  for De Paul as to Yong
[5291.20 - 5293.20] P:1602.07 E:0.109839 |  challenge was made
[5293.20 - 5295.20] P:1762.14 E:0.119202 |  by Alvarez who's been a real
[5295.20 - 5297.20] P:1838.68 E:0.088516 |  tireless
[5297.20 - 5299.20] P:1714.86 E:0.100836 |  running the channels
[5299.20 - 5301.20] P:1677.20 E:0.105900 |  for Argentina
[5301.20 - 5303.20] P:1515.70 E:0.100985 |  we're approaching the midway point
[5303.20 - 5305.20] P:1633.59 E:0.099714 |  to the second half
[5305.20 - 5307.20] P:1564.99 E:0.114873 |  Netherlands 0

[5313.20 - 5315.20] P:1620.88 E:0.110138 |  for the Netherlands now
[5315.20 - 5317.20] P:1685.34 E:0.121815 |  didn't have any joy
[5317.20 - 5319.20] P:1509.68 E:0.108368 |  centrally
[5319.20 - 5321.20] P:1639.57 E:0.112867 |  right hand channel

[5337.20 - 5339.20] P:1768.08 E:0.103548 |  was Colt Minas

[5357.20 - 5359.20] P:1544.14 E:0.105094 |  the Dutch
[5359.20 - 5361.20] P:1683.16 E:0.118203 |  they need to start showing their minerals
[5363.20 - 5365.20] P:1661.89 E:0.087570 |  see what he did there van Dijk

[5375.20 - 5377.20] P:1785.89 E:0.102534 |  was that the referee says no he got the ball

[5379.20 - 5381.20] P:1719.29 E:0.104596 |  and in fact

[5383.20 - 5385.20] P:1745.22 E:0.093730 |  for the earlier foul I think
[5385.20 - 5387.20] P:1699.27 E:0.102291 |  it's a bit strange
[5387.20 - 5389.20] P:1623.95 E:0.089644 |  the referee

[5397.20 - 5399.20] P:1767.26 E:0.115423 |  he could have given the free kick from the wide area there

[5449.20 - 5451.20] P:1724.31 E:0.102280 |  lifted back by Ake
[5451.20 - 5453.20] P:1765.93 E:0.110492 |  and that was a foul off the ball
[5453.20 - 5455.20] P:1783.91 E:0.111229 |  and
[5455.20 - 5457.20] P:1810.33 E:0.116064 |  it was Coat-minus
[5457.20 - 5459.20] P:1539.90 E:0.116709 |  and there's going to be a free kick to
[5459.20 - 5461.20] P:1548.87 E:0.114130 |  Argentina on Romero
[5461.20 - 5463.20] P:1704.43 E:0.110388 |  shake it ahead from Coat-minus

[5485.20 - 5487.20] P:1751.89 E:0.092493 |  Alvarez don't ever so well

[5505.20 - 5507.20] P:1808.15 E:0.108038 |  rapid right back is Molina
[5507.20 - 5509.20] P:1674.08 E:0.097261 |  took his goal ever so well
[5509.20 - 5511.20] P:1817.12 E:0.103977 |  10 minutes before half time and that's still the difference
[5511.20 - 5513.20] P:1460.05 E:0.089859 |  between the two

[5517.20 - 5519.20] P:1776.87 E:0.105474 |  and Molina almost round the back
[5519.20 - 5521.20] P:1766.02 E:0.098806 |  Acay at left back sliding
[5521.20 - 5523.20] P:1897.31 E:0.116638 |  getting up to sit into the path of
[5523.20 - 5525.20] P:1887.63 E:0.102722 |  Van Dyke
[5525.20 - 5527.20] P:1705.12 E:0.112141 |  Acay did really well
[5527.20 - 5529.20] P:1501.19 E:0.109377 |  just to clean up
[5529.20 - 5531.20] P:1630.12 E:0.111830 |  off the Berners on then
[5531.20 - 5533.20] P:1633.53 E:0.104985 |  this is McAllister running forward
[5535.20 - 5537.20] P:1626.52 E:0.113079 |  partially cleared away
[5537.20 - 5539.20] P:1606.25 E:0.098602 |  kickback up by Acunha

[5541.20 - 5543.20] P:1831.63 E:0.116553 |  Acunha goes down is that inside the penalty
[5543.20 - 5545.20] P:1891.61 E:0.112958 |  it is
[5545.20 - 5547.20] P:1871.68 E:0.121152 |  Acunha was brought down
[5547.20 - 5549.20] P:1774.61 E:0.117250 |  and the referee points to the penalty spot
[5549.20 - 5551.20] P:1813.14 E:0.110801 |  and Argentina
[5551.20 - 5553.20] P:1743.28 E:0.113290 |  leading by a goal to Niel
[5553.20 - 5555.20] P:1673.30 E:0.100658 |  have a chance
[5555.20 - 5557.20] P:1759.65 E:0.113046 |  to increase their lead
[5561.20 - 5563.20] P:1678.89 E:0.118332 |  on the left hand side

[5571.20 - 5573.20] P:1552.84 E:0.097754 |  does catch him
[5573.20 - 5575.20] P:1683.58 E:0.110866 |  I think he's quite theatrical
[5575.20 - 5577.20] P:1548.41 E:0.101174 |  Acunha
[5577.20 - 5579.20] P:1580.08 E:0.105195 |  but there was
[5579.20 - 5581.20] P:1632.76 E:0.097619 |  sufficient contact
[5581.20 - 5583.20] P:1626.72 E:0.106387 |  it was a foul
[5585.20 - 5587.20] P:1651.47 E:0.110573 |  no messy

[5593.20 - 5595.20] P:1950.71 E:0.103274 |  yes
[5597.20 - 5599.20] P:1939.17 E:0.118853 |  of his 94 goals
[5601.20 - 5603.20] P:1907.03 E:0.115623 |  that he has scored for Argentina
[5603.20 - 5605.20] P:1803.69 E:0.092664 |  they are all time top scorer
[5605.20 - 5607.20] P:1771.47 E:0.094358 |  26 of them
[5609.20 - 5611.20] P:1662.93 E:0.104691 |  have come from the spot
[5615.20 - 5617.20] P:1637.37 E:0.110782 |  little
[5617.20 - 5619.20] P:1543.73 E:0.112815 |  little lead
[5619.20 - 5621.20] P:1605.44 E:0.108042 |  he's a giant isn't he
[5621.20 - 5623.20] P:1597.47 E:0.099818 |  not bird
[5625.20 - 5627.20] P:1818.57 E:0.120893 |  a giant in the Dutch goal
[5627.20 - 5629.20] P:1580.49 E:0.101208 |  at 6 foot 8
[5629.20 - 5631.20] P:1768.14 E:0.114885 |  the diminutive figure
[5631.20 - 5633.20] P:1649.12 E:0.108570 |  little messy
[5633.20 - 5635.20] P:1837.77 E:0.114281 |  incredible to think that his goal against Australia
[5635.20 - 5637.20] P:1758.60 E:0.106116 |  was his first in the knockout stages
[5637.20 - 5639.20] P:1732.15 E:0.100926 |  of a world cup
[5641.20 - 5643.20] P:1635.73 E:0.099177 |  with 18 minutes remaining
[5643.20 - 5645.20] P:1527.28 E:0.110228 |  this penalty
[5645.20 - 5647.20] P:1704.09 E:0.108792 |  for Argentina
[5647.20 - 5649.20] P:1797.74 E:0.111583 |  and for little messy
[5649.20 - 5651.20] P:1487.21 E:0.092361 |  will surely take them into the last four
[5653.20 - 5655.20] P:1544.06 E:0.113883 |  messy
[5655.20 - 5657.20] P:1518.26 E:0.096011 |  waits patiently
[5657.20 - 5659.20] P:1694.59 E:0.117707 |  messy runs up now
[5659.20 - 5661.20] P:1801.90 E:0.110412 |  and scores
[5661.20 - 5663.20] P:1865.56 E:0.122022 |  the keeper didn't even move
[5663.20 - 5665.20] P:1808.48 E:0.117157 |  left-footed
[5665.20 - 5667.20] P:1914.97 E:0.118105 |  messy takes the claim of the
[5667.20 - 5669.20] P:1813.69 E:0.117541 |  Argentinian support
[5669.20 - 5671.20] P:1822.76 E:0.115600 |  his dream is still alive
[5671.20 - 5673.20] P:1907.99 E:0.120832 |  the Argentinian dream
[5673.20 - 5675.20] P:1739.06 E:0.118997 |  is still alive
[5675.20 - 5677.20] P:1854.91 E:0.118482 |  and surely now they're separate day with Croatia
[5677.20 - 5679.20] P:1815.18 E:0.116755 |  in the semi-finals
[5679.20 - 5681.20] P:1735.88 E:0.126264 |  because they lead the Netherlands
[5681.20 - 5683.20] P:1767.32 E:0.120378 |  by two goals to nil
[5683.20 - 5685.20] P:1570.48 E:0.116588 |  and of course
[5685.20 - 5687.20] P:1692.12 E:0.114591 |  messy is the man who delivers
[5689.20 - 5691.20] P:1805.59 E:0.117992 |  no surprise
[5691.20 - 5693.20] P:1863.10 E:0.129169 |  coolest man
[5693.20 - 5695.20] P:1655.18 E:0.119111 |  in the stadium
[5695.20 - 5697.20] P:1810.78 E:0.119300 |  just
[5697.20 - 5699.20] P:1782.25 E:0.120838 |  strolled up to the ball
[5699.20 - 5701.20] P:1776.66 E:0.124618 |  he watches
[5701.20 - 5703.20] P:1598.99 E:0.120542 |  all the way
[5703.20 - 5705.20] P:1794.99 E:0.112839 |  and the big Dutch goalkeeper
[5705.20 - 5707.20] P:1700.47 E:0.121820 |  just stands up messy
[5707.20 - 5709.20] P:1724.51 E:0.119255 |  whips it across him
[5709.20 - 5711.20] P:1809.18 E:0.123051 |  to Nopperts left-hand side
[5711.20 - 5713.20] P:1593.92 E:0.116947 |  half way up
[5713.20 - 5715.20] P:1768.15 E:0.136333 |  just has a look doesn't he
[5715.20 - 5717.20] P:1669.80 E:0.131872 |  just has a look doesn't he
[5717.20 - 5719.20] P:1658.02 E:0.117221 |  just has a look doesn't he
[5719.20 - 5721.20] P:1783.21 E:0.121434 |  like a stroll in the park
[5721.20 - 5723.20] P:1774.64 E:0.112297 |  finds the side netting
[5725.20 - 5727.20] P:1754.35 E:0.133483 |  I think it's game over now
[5727.20 - 5729.20] P:1742.02 E:0.115259 |  the Dutch
[5729.20 - 5731.20] P:1675.36 E:0.123643 |  have got it all to do but
[5731.20 - 5733.20] P:1864.58 E:0.128605 |  on the big occasion
[5733.20 - 5735.20] P:1845.11 E:0.117861 |  the little fella
[5735.20 - 5737.20] P:1844.26 E:0.108929 |  well he just keeps rocking up doesn't he
[5737.20 - 5739.20] P:1732.32 E:0.098603 |  he's got a great
[5739.20 - 5741.20] P:1499.59 E:0.118066 |  great
[5741.20 - 5743.20] P:1544.38 E:0.121370 |  takes him
[5743.20 - 5745.20] P:1634.97 E:0.109082 |  level with Gabriel Bacistuta
[5745.20 - 5747.20] P:1795.29 E:0.115595 |  the 10 goals
[5747.20 - 5749.20] P:1823.89 E:0.120894 |  in the world cup
[5749.20 - 5751.20] P:1832.10 E:0.123500 |  and in Martinez here
[5751.20 - 5753.20] P:1795.77 E:0.111952 |  we had to angrily
[5753.20 - 5755.20] P:1707.13 E:0.120494 |  to Luke De Jong
[5755.20 - 5757.20] P:1717.96 E:0.122548 |  and all of a sudden the referee
[5757.20 - 5759.20] P:1701.82 E:0.115334 |  has got a sort out
[5759.20 - 5761.20] P:1977.52 E:0.118066 |  the squabbles and the shoving
[5761.20 - 5763.20] P:1897.35 E:0.108970 |  and the pushing inside that penalty area
[5763.20 - 5765.20] P:2082.74 E:0.116812 |  is blowing his whistle
[5765.20 - 5767.20] P:1697.63 E:0.086493 |  five times
[5769.20 - 5771.20] P:1762.01 E:0.102164 |  he'll be taking it all in
[5773.20 - 5775.20] P:1848.35 E:0.116040 |  oh and
[5775.20 - 5777.20] P:1825.62 E:0.117352 |  an Argentinian
[5777.20 - 5779.20] P:1685.45 E:0.110952 |  is that an Argentinian
[5779.20 - 5781.20] P:1673.27 E:0.108713 |  fan
[5783.20 - 5785.20] P:1890.77 E:0.115699 |  well
[5785.20 - 5787.20] P:1904.02 E:0.107548 |  somebody's run on it's hard to tell
[5787.20 - 5789.20] P:1911.19 E:0.104455 |  he's actually been manhandled by
[5789.20 - 5791.20] P:1783.55 E:0.095863 |  four security guards
[5791.20 - 5793.20] P:1854.72 E:0.108743 |  if he's wearing shorts
[5793.20 - 5795.20] P:1769.92 E:0.089571 |  he's got some accreditation there
[5797.20 - 5799.20] P:1823.73 E:0.121312 |  so whether that was
[5799.20 - 5801.20] P:1926.00 E:0.105963 |  an Argentinian fan
[5803.20 - 5805.20] P:1937.93 E:0.106366 |  I think it must be
[5805.20 - 5807.20] P:1916.29 E:0.096400 |  because if it was
[5807.20 - 5809.20] P:1854.19 E:0.094360 |  someone off the bench
[5811.20 - 5813.20] P:1679.78 E:0.094791 |  there's definitely
[5813.20 - 5815.20] P:1758.25 E:0.098694 |  accreditation
[5815.20 - 5817.20] P:1773.97 E:0.087014 |  I mean he's hardly got any clothes left on
[5819.20 - 5821.20] P:1859.91 E:0.108422 |  mind you
[5821.20 - 5823.20] P:1852.99 E:0.107994 |  I think he's taking five or six of them
[5825.20 - 5827.20] P:1766.08 E:0.110881 |  that's the equivalent of Mr Mussel down there
[5827.20 - 5829.20] P:1765.95 E:0.101180 |  there's about six of them
[5829.20 - 5831.20] P:1807.22 E:0.094606 |  the stewards are all in black
[5831.20 - 5833.20] P:1669.32 E:0.098587 |  he's been dragged away
[5835.20 - 5837.20] P:1788.60 E:0.120481 |  the reason is he's wearing shorts
[5837.20 - 5839.20] P:1871.69 E:0.101124 |  by the time they tackle them very very quickly
[5841.20 - 5843.20] P:1853.57 E:0.106452 |  and our eyes have been transfixed on that
[5843.20 - 5845.20] P:1850.42 E:0.114296 |  I've forgotten what had happened with the players
[5845.20 - 5847.20] P:1770.68 E:0.110047 |  it was all happening there for a minute
[5847.20 - 5849.20] P:1673.01 E:0.114036 |  he's being hauled out
[5849.20 - 5851.20] P:1487.97 E:0.113688 |  across from the Dutch
[5851.20 - 5853.20] P:1691.89 E:0.113538 |  right hand side
[5853.20 - 5855.20] P:1648.03 E:0.107265 |  Martinez
[5855.20 - 5857.20] P:1740.97 E:0.103062 |  came and gathered
[5857.20 - 5859.20] P:1737.60 E:0.117241 |  plenty of hide on the cross
[5859.20 - 5861.20] P:1806.05 E:0.120030 |  and I think Lutte Jong just left a little bit on him
[5861.20 - 5863.20] P:1615.87 E:0.107130 |  and then
[5863.20 - 5865.20] P:1554.25 E:0.105941 |  it all kicked off
[5865.20 - 5867.20] P:1740.45 E:0.122396 |  De Pye getting involved
[5867.20 - 5869.20] P:1723.35 E:0.104906 |  the Dutch showing some fight
[5869.20 - 5871.20] P:1819.80 E:0.095630 |  but is it too late
[5871.20 - 5873.20] P:1673.30 E:0.113187 |  De Pye and every Martinez booked
[5873.20 - 5875.20] P:1750.29 E:0.118651 |  gap points is the penalty area
[5875.20 - 5877.20] P:1630.80 E:0.108860 |  what's the contact there
[5877.20 - 5879.20] P:1752.20 E:0.105370 |  the Netherlands are looking for a penalty
[5879.20 - 5881.20] P:1753.64 E:0.092569 |  Gakpo went get down
[5881.20 - 5883.20] P:1757.32 E:0.102622 |  might have been a soft one
[5883.20 - 5885.20] P:1896.19 E:0.112003 |  I'd like to see that again
[5885.20 - 5887.20] P:1710.64 E:0.086442 |  was there contact
[5889.20 - 5891.20] P:1552.01 E:0.123142 |  Cody Gakpo
[5891.20 - 5893.20] P:1426.64 E:0.113122 |  or contact on the ball
[5893.20 - 5895.20] P:1765.04 E:0.117900 |  Valtvec horse is going to be coming on
[5895.20 - 5897.20] P:1600.04 E:0.113526 |  I think the Dutch
[5897.20 - 5899.20] P:1672.89 E:0.112651 |  88,235
[5899.20 - 5901.20] P:1623.75 E:0.110456 |  is the official attendance
[5901.20 - 5903.20] P:1460.69 E:0.115022 |  Valtvec horse is going to be coming on
[5903.20 - 5905.20] P:1561.51 E:0.118714 |  I think they're just going to go
[5905.20 - 5907.20] P:1831.94 E:0.115944 |  route 1 here to Netherlands
[5907.20 - 5909.20] P:1787.07 E:0.118452 |  try and follow what Australia did
[5909.20 - 5911.20] P:1837.26 E:0.111657 |  to try and make it an uncomfortable
[5911.20 - 5913.20] P:1847.76 E:0.108267 |  last
[5913.20 - 5915.20] P:1663.98 E:0.087421 |  what 13 minutes of normal time
[5915.20 - 5917.20] P:1801.95 E:0.112332 |  meanwhile Argentina
[5917.20 - 5919.20] P:1708.12 E:0.101275 |  are going to be making
[5919.20 - 5921.20] P:1651.15 E:0.101052 |  a couple of changes as well
[5923.20 - 5925.20] P:1647.73 E:0.120019 |  Talia Fico
[5925.20 - 5927.20] P:1708.36 E:0.109796 |  the left back will be one of them
[5927.20 - 5929.20] P:1510.10 E:0.110110 |  so he's going to come on for
[5929.20 - 5931.20] P:1632.56 E:0.104906 |  Acuña
[5931.20 - 5933.20] P:1630.22 E:0.103653 |  so that's like for like
[5933.20 - 5935.20] P:1571.70 E:0.114297 |  Acuña
[5935.20 - 5937.20] P:1689.13 E:0.106620 |  will miss of course the semi-final
[5937.20 - 5939.20] P:1468.44 E:0.109044 |  through suspension
[5939.20 - 5941.20] P:1566.05 E:0.116266 |  and then it will be
[5941.20 - 5943.20] P:1769.29 E:0.117055 |  Jameen Passella
[5943.20 - 5945.20] P:1658.60 E:0.108006 |  who will also be coming on
[5945.20 - 5947.20] P:1345.39 E:0.109860 |  who's an essential defender
[5947.20 - 5949.20] P:1608.42 E:0.102012 |  so I think
[5949.20 - 5951.20] P:1686.72 E:0.103450 |  this is Scoloni reacting
[5951.20 - 5953.20] P:1361.65 E:0.110787 |  and getting
[5953.20 - 5955.20] P:1590.35 E:0.099599 |  another body at the back
[5955.20 - 5957.20] P:1486.23 E:0.109556 |  is it Romero
[5957.20 - 5959.20] P:1586.26 E:0.105644 |  coming off
[5959.20 - 5961.20] P:1497.03 E:0.114232 |  Romero's
[5961.20 - 5963.20] P:1857.58 E:0.109184 |  Acuña's gone off the far side
[5965.20 - 5967.20] P:1815.50 E:0.116720 |  Romero coming off here
[5967.20 - 5969.20] P:1779.28 E:0.097453 |  so straight swap
[5969.20 - 5971.20] P:1717.89 E:0.100104 |  Passella into the back line
[5971.20 - 5973.20] P:1727.69 E:0.111251 |  and the Dutch are going ugly
[5973.20 - 5975.20] P:1465.19 E:0.111474 |  De Pye is the one
[5975.20 - 5977.20] P:1544.12 E:0.103657 |  who comes off
[5977.20 - 5979.20] P:1566.04 E:0.112980 |  Valtvec horse
[5979.20 - 5981.20] P:1577.68 E:0.114545 |  comes on
[5981.20 - 5983.20] P:1467.97 E:0.105778 |  the ex-Bernley man
[5983.20 - 5985.20] P:1601.83 E:0.110411 |  now playing his pride
[5985.20 - 5987.20] P:1753.34 E:0.112378 |  Istanbul for Bessik Tash
[5989.20 - 5991.20] P:1474.82 E:0.119898 |  and you're right it was Romero
[5991.20 - 5993.20] P:1336.98 E:0.101969 |  who had gone off for Passella
[5993.20 - 5995.20] P:1503.41 E:0.112308 |  well this is going to be
[5995.20 - 5997.20] P:1386.05 E:0.103641 |  Huffball from the Dutch now isn't it
[5997.20 - 5999.20] P:1579.78 E:0.117319 |  two huge
[5999.20 - 6001.20] P:1155.06 E:0.102250 |  strikers
[6001.20 - 6003.20] P:1146.63 E:0.106478 |  you think
[6003.20 - 6005.20] P:1636.63 E:0.116795 |  it's just going to be
[6005.20 - 6007.20] P:1717.12 E:0.104344 |  direct brutal knock down football
[6007.20 - 6009.20] P:1642.75 E:0.097129 |  runners off
[6009.20 - 6011.20] P:1742.03 E:0.115726 |  Beckhorst and De Jong
[6011.20 - 6015.20] P:1574.56 E:0.113290 |  critics of Louis van Haal will say
[6015.20 - 6017.20] P:1547.88 E:0.111331 |  tonight even hasn't been pretty
[6017.20 - 6019.20] P:1727.63 E:0.113218 |  before they start to do that ugly side of the game
[6019.20 - 6021.20] P:1328.50 E:0.118693 |  that Chris Sutton is referring to
[6021.20 - 6025.20] P:1409.93 E:0.113482 |  trailing by two goals to nil
[6025.20 - 6027.20] P:1376.12 E:0.118320 |  ball played in
[6027.20 - 6029.20] P:1577.68 E:0.114789 |  headed on by Beckhorst towards De Jong
[6029.20 - 6031.20] P:1603.41 E:0.112537 |  and then hooked away by McAllister
[6035.20 - 6037.20] P:1716.49 E:0.113966 |  they are giants aren't they
[6037.20 - 6039.20] P:1593.36 E:0.093619 |  Beckhorst
[6039.20 - 6041.20] P:1404.98 E:0.090104 |  De Jong
[6041.20 - 6043.20] P:1554.55 E:0.106066 |  Stature
[6043.20 - 6045.20] P:1557.07 E:0.117921 |  3 Arjun
[6045.20 - 6047.20] P:1678.71 E:0.104928 |  Tinnian centre halves
[6047.20 - 6049.20] P:1682.11 E:0.114951 |  remember as well that Beckhorst
[6049.20 - 6051.20] P:1640.10 E:0.110472 |  is already on a yellow card
[6051.20 - 6053.20] P:1714.95 E:0.102709 |  having been booked in the first half
[6055.20 - 6057.20] P:1756.46 E:0.114752 |  speaking out of turn when he was on the
[6057.20 - 6059.20] P:1538.29 E:0.110684 |  on the bench so he's got to be careful
[6059.20 - 6061.20] P:1336.56 E:0.110387 |  and straight away he's in the thick of it
[6063.20 - 6065.20] P:1490.90 E:0.118278 |  and Martinis who has also booked
[6065.20 - 6067.20] P:1518.91 E:0.114887 |  catches the ball as it's just
[6067.20 - 6069.20] P:1384.94 E:0.104039 |  tossed to him
[6069.20 - 6071.20] P:1533.83 E:0.091027 |  and in fact
[6071.20 - 6073.20] P:1507.94 E:0.105441 |  there's been a
[6073.20 - 6075.20] P:1651.08 E:0.098828 |  owner we gave it with that yellow card
[6075.20 - 6077.20] P:1599.47 E:0.102989 |  they're just only now saying that Martinis has been
[6081.20 - 6083.20] P:1684.48 E:0.120712 |  it was Sandra Martinis
[6083.20 - 6085.20] P:1625.81 E:0.116846 |  not Emmy Martinis
[6085.20 - 6087.20] P:1513.49 E:0.117758 |  I've lost well
[6087.20 - 6089.20] P:1362.72 E:0.115625 |  I've lost count of everything
[6091.20 - 6093.20] P:1748.28 E:0.107483 |  header four with by van Dijk
[6093.20 - 6095.20] P:1610.16 E:0.106585 |  flick header by Beckhorst
[6095.20 - 6097.20] P:1658.04 E:0.103693 |  and then eventually
[6097.20 - 6099.20] P:1682.94 E:0.110557 |  hammered away by Osamendi
[6099.20 - 6101.20] P:1695.50 E:0.114362 |  to Messi nice ball played forward
[6101.20 - 6103.20] P:1691.83 E:0.116068 |  by Fernandez
[6103.20 - 6105.20] P:1675.16 E:0.115307 |  to McAllister Alvarez he's out wide
[6105.20 - 6107.20] P:1706.63 E:0.112988 |  Alvarez into the penalty area
[6107.20 - 6109.20] P:1654.41 E:0.109698 |  Alvarez with a cut back
[6109.20 - 6111.20] P:1715.33 E:0.107503 |  sat up in the air and caught by
[6111.20 - 6113.20] P:1680.15 E:0.098287 |  the goalkeeper Nopper
[6113.20 - 6115.20] P:1604.38 E:0.109584 |  I just wondered whether
[6115.20 - 6117.20] P:1448.09 E:0.108880 |  Alvarez could have got a shot off
[6117.20 - 6119.20] P:1449.28 E:0.104796 |  quicker decided to
[6119.20 - 6121.20] P:1529.10 E:0.116816 |  drive on the outside of Dumfries
[6121.20 - 6123.20] P:1273.64 E:0.111205 |  crossed the ball Dumfries
[6123.20 - 6125.20] P:1482.06 E:0.099837 |  got a boot on it
[6125.20 - 6127.20] P:1451.12 E:0.089855 |  Nopper gathered
[6127.20 - 6129.20] P:1667.45 E:0.075778 |  gratefully
[6129.20 - 6131.20] P:1808.85 E:0.096966 |  they've gone 4-2 for the Dutch
[6131.20 - 6133.20] P:1668.08 E:0.083088 |  Gakpo is playing wide left
[6133.20 - 6135.20] P:1757.06 E:0.098974 |  Burghus has gone wide right
[6135.20 - 6137.20] P:1631.52 E:0.104013 |  and then Beckhorst and De Jong in the middle
[6137.20 - 6139.20] P:1843.70 E:0.117656 |  that was a thunderous
[6139.20 - 6141.20] P:1761.56 E:0.099894 |  challenge
[6141.20 - 6143.20] P:1814.02 E:0.112679 |  but the referee
[6143.20 - 6145.20] P:1675.75 E:0.096840 |  is actually saying
[6145.20 - 6147.20] P:1844.41 E:0.110696 |  he's given the free kick
[6147.20 - 6149.20] P:1524.37 E:0.109206 |  as Argentina are going to be
[6149.20 - 6151.20] P:1765.59 E:0.096720 |  making another change
[6151.20 - 6153.20] P:1804.18 E:0.119997 |  the radius wasn't up with the challenge
[6153.20 - 6155.20] P:1778.96 E:0.117156 |  we're sitting not far away
[6155.20 - 6157.20] P:1805.42 E:0.114925 |  from Martin Keone
[6157.20 - 6159.20] P:1837.76 E:0.119053 |  who calls that type of challenge
[6159.20 - 6161.20] P:1909.12 E:0.111761 |  a reducer
[6163.20 - 6165.20] P:1808.72 E:0.123811 |  listen to the ovation note
[6165.20 - 6167.20] P:1825.70 E:0.114078 |  for Julian Alvarez
[6167.20 - 6169.20] P:1854.27 E:0.111703 |  the Manchester City player
[6169.20 - 6171.20] P:1687.72 E:0.112280 |  the Argentinian supporters tonight
[6171.20 - 6173.20] P:1782.66 E:0.115662 |  realise
[6173.20 - 6175.20] P:1713.22 E:0.102625 |  and can appreciate
[6175.20 - 6177.20] P:1751.61 E:0.114808 |  how hard he has worked
[6177.20 - 6179.20] P:1783.75 E:0.105186 |  as he's replaced
[6179.20 - 6181.20] P:1697.43 E:0.122758 |  by
[6181.20 - 6183.20] P:1738.88 E:0.120066 |  Artaro Martinez
[6183.20 - 6185.20] P:1682.32 E:0.121408 |  he was first
[6185.20 - 6187.20] P:1648.59 E:0.113142 |  picking the first game
[6187.20 - 6189.20] P:1331.67 E:0.120711 |  against Senegal
[6189.20 - 6191.20] P:1467.76 E:0.116014 |  up alongside
[6191.20 - 6193.20] P:1434.51 E:0.113803 |  so Alvarez now
[6193.20 - 6195.20] P:1604.55 E:0.113419 |  the preferred choice
[6195.20 - 6197.20] P:1414.12 E:0.116817 |  Gakpo
[6197.20 - 6199.20] P:1553.29 E:0.113525 |  with the curling free kick
[6199.20 - 6201.20] P:1553.04 E:0.107762 |  headed away by Fernandez
[6201.20 - 6203.20] P:1721.92 E:0.103591 |  they only need one though to Dutch
[6203.20 - 6205.20] P:1791.99 E:0.091387 |  don't they to cause a bit of panic
[6205.20 - 6207.20] P:1447.96 E:0.085945 |  yeah they do
[6207.20 - 6209.20] P:1647.70 E:0.087002 |  Australia did
[6211.20 - 6213.20] P:1777.53 E:0.111667 |  they were serenely
[6213.20 - 6215.20] P:1867.04 E:0.108270 |  progressing until Australia
[6215.20 - 6217.20] P:1939.12 E:0.101960 |  in fact that late save by
[6219.20 - 6221.20] P:1844.63 E:0.110792 |  Hermione Martinez
[6221.20 - 6223.20] P:1688.15 E:0.072792 |  they've all stayed forward there
[6223.20 - 6225.20] P:1612.30 E:0.084260 |  Van Dyke, Akke
[6225.20 - 6227.20] P:1735.49 E:0.117616 |  Cross comes in from the right
[6227.20 - 6229.20] P:1740.57 E:0.109077 |  headed out by Ottenendig
[6229.20 - 6231.20] P:1597.33 E:0.103057 |  Marshall's defence and walks that line

[6233.20 - 6235.20] P:1838.29 E:0.108950 |  sky blue shirts to push on out
[6235.20 - 6237.20] P:1797.70 E:0.108391 |  towards the right, Berkers
[6237.20 - 6239.20] P:1849.37 E:0.118465 |  and it comes and they've got a goal
[6239.20 - 6241.20] P:1883.50 E:0.117526 |  Veghorst
[6241.20 - 6243.20] P:1790.87 E:0.113362 |  off the bench
[6243.20 - 6245.20] P:1846.15 E:0.115825 |  Vald Veghorst

[6247.20 - 6249.20] P:1782.71 E:0.106103 |  remaining and their gamble
[6249.20 - 6251.20] P:1951.91 E:0.114458 |  has paid off, they've reduced the areas
[6251.20 - 6253.20] P:1937.52 E:0.104506 |  cross from the right, heads it past
[6253.20 - 6255.20] P:1752.57 E:0.097930 |  Demi Martinez
[6255.20 - 6257.20] P:1792.57 E:0.106728 |  and it sets up a dramatic finale
[6257.20 - 6259.20] P:1747.79 E:0.110370 |  what a header this is
[6259.20 - 6261.20] P:1807.43 E:0.112243 |  from Veghorst, the ball whipped in
[6261.20 - 6263.20] P:1725.91 E:0.112965 |  from the right hand side
[6263.20 - 6265.20] P:1544.78 E:0.108869 |  and the left footed
[6265.20 - 6267.20] P:1669.21 E:0.120952 |  they can't play through them
[6267.20 - 6269.20] P:1787.02 E:0.109279 |  the Dutch
[6269.20 - 6271.20] P:1910.62 E:0.111687 |  so they'll just go direct, crosses into the
[6271.20 - 6273.20] P:1892.69 E:0.097350 |  box, got the big guys on
[6275.20 - 6277.20] P:1964.77 E:0.105419 |  and this is going to be a nervy last
[6277.20 - 6279.20] P:1709.82 E:0.087711 |  seven minutes
[6279.20 - 6281.20] P:1492.42 E:0.098945 |  plus whatever
[6281.20 - 6283.20] P:1741.69 E:0.079325 |  for Argentina
[6283.20 - 6285.20] P:1617.32 E:0.109322 |  Messi at the moment
[6285.20 - 6287.20] P:1619.05 E:0.090627 |  is down and he's
[6289.20 - 6291.20] P:1651.73 E:0.115490 |  just turned over onto his back
[6291.20 - 6293.20] P:1756.54 E:0.116979 |  and he's not sure what happened there
[6293.20 - 6295.20] P:1544.71 E:0.113861 |  from the kickoff, it was played back
[6295.20 - 6297.20] P:1553.02 E:0.113202 |  towards Messi
[6297.20 - 6299.20] P:1774.41 E:0.112408 |  and then there was a late challenge
[6299.20 - 6301.20] P:1574.36 E:0.115581 |  and it was from
[6301.20 - 6303.20] P:1438.35 E:0.086901 |  Veghorst, he stands on
[6303.20 - 6305.20] P:1646.03 E:0.107022 |  Veghorst
[6305.20 - 6307.20] P:1477.37 E:0.093819 |  he's on a yellow card remember
[6307.20 - 6309.20] P:1702.09 E:0.121814 |  Veghorst is huge
[6309.20 - 6311.20] P:1581.03 E:0.089885 |  left foot on
[6311.20 - 6313.20] P:1418.04 E:0.092394 |  Lionel's foot
[6313.20 - 6315.20] P:1694.63 E:0.107577 |  must be ten sizes difference
[6315.20 - 6317.20] P:1619.93 E:0.082922 |  yeah
[6317.20 - 6319.20] P:1515.81 E:0.099004 |  giant isn't he
[6319.20 - 6321.20] P:1468.87 E:0.095126 |  Veghorst
[6321.20 - 6323.20] P:1572.85 E:0.108421 |  forget total football

[6329.20 - 6331.20] P:1694.87 E:0.110474 |  Incredible though, isn't it, that it's panning out
[6331.20 - 6333.20] P:1467.43 E:0.099724 |  exactly the same way
[6333.20 - 6335.20] P:1663.93 E:0.103019 |  as it did against Australia
[6335.20 - 6337.20] P:1631.99 E:0.104412 |  because two little up against Australia
[6337.20 - 6339.20] P:1716.53 E:0.108125 |  and there were really some anxious
[6339.20 - 6341.20] P:1571.81 E:0.089389 |  moments for Argentina
[6341.20 - 6343.20] P:1755.65 E:0.109827 |  and they're going to have to maybe go through
[6343.20 - 6345.20] P:1720.17 E:0.095954 |  similar nerve-shredding
[6345.20 - 6347.20] P:1903.93 E:0.113028 |  moments here with six minutes remaining
[6347.20 - 6349.20] P:1695.27 E:0.106328 |  the fact that the Dutch, of all of a sudden
[6349.20 - 6351.20] P:1617.81 E:0.102017 |  crossed from the right
[6351.20 - 6353.20] P:1539.16 E:0.095877 |  header, reduced the areas
[6353.20 - 6355.20] P:1675.30 E:0.116603 |  absolutely and there's been a lot made
[6355.20 - 6357.20] P:1455.83 E:0.107701 |  as a result of the Dutch style
[6357.20 - 6359.20] P:1523.00 E:0.108698 |  in this World Cup competition
[6361.20 - 6363.20] P:1464.85 E:0.113952 |  and they are playing the most basic
[6363.20 - 6365.20] P:1610.11 E:0.097734 |  form of football
[6365.20 - 6367.20] P:1736.46 E:0.103543 |  but it's about being effective
[6367.20 - 6369.20] P:1633.07 E:0.085052 |  and they're back in this
[6369.20 - 6371.20] P:1669.78 E:0.115848 |  Jack Poe with the cross from the left-hand side
[6371.20 - 6373.20] P:1879.82 E:0.110484 |  the young weights down with header
[6373.20 - 6375.20] P:1871.81 E:0.120843 |  oh what a hit that was
[6375.20 - 6377.20] P:1794.86 E:0.112100 |  what it was in for a moment
[6377.20 - 6379.20] P:1981.92 E:0.118756 |  it was Burgos who just struck it
[6379.20 - 6381.20] P:1686.37 E:0.100261 |  left-footed
[6381.20 - 6383.20] P:1847.98 E:0.118451 |  and it was travelling like a bullet
[6383.20 - 6385.20] P:1649.42 E:0.101099 |  into the side of the net
[6385.20 - 6387.20] P:1791.01 E:0.117657 |  the little Argentinians
[6387.20 - 6389.20] P:1791.68 E:0.107878 |  cannot cope
[6389.20 - 6391.20] P:1650.78 E:0.111715 |  with this aerial
[6391.20 - 6393.20] P:1624.33 E:0.114735 |  onslaught from the Dutch
[6393.20 - 6395.20] P:1718.97 E:0.112705 |  terrific knockdown from Veghorst
[6395.20 - 6397.20] P:1836.29 E:0.114935 |  I thought it was in as well
[6397.20 - 6399.20] P:1841.20 E:0.113409 |  somehow it's a corner, what happened
[6399.20 - 6401.20] P:1783.58 E:0.119489 |  corner kick on that far side
[6401.20 - 6403.20] P:1598.07 E:0.114739 |  the Argentinian supporters
[6403.20 - 6405.20] P:1794.31 E:0.119802 |  are trying to do their bit
[6405.20 - 6407.20] P:1611.75 E:0.107209 |  but the Netherlands with another corner
[6407.20 - 6409.20] P:1686.20 E:0.125244 |  from the right-hand side
[6409.20 - 6411.20] P:1809.51 E:0.101927 |  are going to make it a rather uncomfortable
[6411.20 - 6413.20] P:1807.40 E:0.113052 |  last five minutes
[6415.20 - 6417.20] P:1792.57 E:0.120390 |  but they're trying to see them over the line
[6417.20 - 6419.20] P:1591.28 E:0.115411 |  but the way the Argentinian
[6419.20 - 6421.20] P:1704.22 E:0.112611 |  are just dropping back
[6421.20 - 6423.20] P:1723.74 E:0.098926 |  they're inviting the pressure
[6423.20 - 6425.20] P:1768.80 E:0.115581 |  from the Netherlands
[6425.20 - 6427.20] P:1700.44 E:0.111043 |  they're trying to get up the Argentinian backline
[6427.20 - 6429.20] P:1659.18 E:0.107186 |  Van Dijkers stay forward
[6429.20 - 6431.20] P:1591.06 E:0.098347 |  three
[6431.20 - 6433.20] P:1714.48 E:0.107665 |  huge guys up top
[6433.20 - 6435.20] P:1574.27 E:0.100833 |  Veghorst
[6435.20 - 6437.20] P:1798.80 E:0.112314 |  a giant, Van Dijk a giant
[6437.20 - 6439.20] P:1552.50 E:0.096282 |  De Jong a giant
[6439.20 - 6441.20] P:1681.30 E:0.105963 |  they're not the biggest the Argentinian
[6441.20 - 6443.20] P:1800.31 E:0.109396 |  sender halfs are they
[6445.20 - 6447.20] P:1799.86 E:0.123277 |  he said before that it was 4-2-4
[6447.20 - 6449.20] P:1897.91 E:0.114913 |  it's now 3-2-5
[6449.20 - 6451.20] P:1799.85 E:0.106311 |  Van Dijk's up there as well
[6451.20 - 6453.20] P:1614.41 E:0.113616 |  here comes another long ball
[6453.20 - 6455.20] P:1773.99 E:0.117091 |  De Jong with a flick on towards Veghorst
[6455.20 - 6457.20] P:1836.30 E:0.102569 |  before tonight
[6457.20 - 6459.20] P:1778.59 E:0.105932 |  the former Burnley striker
[6459.20 - 6461.20] P:1583.01 E:0.098972 |  had only played 19 minutes
[6461.20 - 6463.20] P:1708.93 E:0.104318 |  of his three appearances
[6463.20 - 6465.20] P:1729.07 E:0.109200 |  at this World Cup
[6465.20 - 6467.20] P:1869.92 E:0.101245 |  but his goal has given a Dutch hope
[6467.20 - 6469.20] P:1793.36 E:0.105424 |  with four minutes remaining
[6469.20 - 6471.20] P:1533.26 E:0.097472 |  five live and BBC sounds
[6471.20 - 6473.20] P:1711.75 E:0.101346 |  live here in Lusail
[6477.20 - 6479.20] P:1659.77 E:0.114293 |  Argentina leading by

[6487.20 - 6489.20] P:1757.90 E:0.107606 |  now with Timber
[6489.20 - 6491.20] P:1602.12 E:0.120488 |  Van Dijk has returned to his more natural position
[6491.20 - 6493.20] P:1680.85 E:0.101287 |  Ake

[6495.20 - 6497.20] P:1724.82 E:0.113946 |  can't take it on the outside of Molina
[6497.20 - 6499.20] P:1686.03 E:0.116807 |  they don't want to drop do they
[6499.20 - 6501.20] P:1760.92 E:0.110743 |  the Argentinian backline every opportunity
[6501.20 - 6503.20] P:1889.54 E:0.116580 |  they're trying to squeeze a yard or two
[6505.20 - 6507.20] P:1713.68 E:0.098180 |  a long searching diagonal ball
[6507.20 - 6509.20] P:1727.73 E:0.106895 |  headed away by Ottermending

[6511.20 - 6513.20] P:1743.75 E:0.105789 |  leaves it for De Jong
[6513.20 - 6515.20] P:1802.34 E:0.116346 |  he's given them all away
[6517.20 - 6519.20] P:1788.07 E:0.109084 |  to

[6525.20 - 6527.20] P:1898.55 E:0.115359 |  oh that was a
[6527.20 - 6529.20] P:1892.88 E:0.109992 |  sliding challenge from
[6529.20 - 6531.20] P:1768.07 E:0.105194 |  Paradez on Ake
[6531.20 - 6533.20] P:1704.77 E:0.100298 |  Messi has stayed down gets the free kick
[6533.20 - 6535.20] P:1799.98 E:0.115432 |  and Verkhoos has just been shown a yellow car
[6537.20 - 6539.20] P:1493.87 E:0.120337 |  I think that must be for
[6539.20 - 6541.20] P:1347.16 E:0.111435 |  descent
[6541.20 - 6543.20] P:1597.39 E:0.118716 |  I've lost track of the yellow car
[6543.20 - 6545.20] P:1623.55 E:0.114003 |  from the referee
[6545.20 - 6547.20] P:1535.31 E:0.119691 |  I've lost track of most things
[6547.20 - 6549.20] P:1423.60 E:0.112075 |  in all honesty
[6549.20 - 6551.20] P:1723.18 E:0.105037 |  Messi took a heavy touch there
[6551.20 - 6553.20] P:1322.38 E:0.096039 |  the worst touches
[6553.20 - 6555.20] P:1603.21 E:0.102289 |  the evening
[6555.20 - 6557.20] P:1680.95 E:0.113811 |  Argentina may be slightly fortunate
[6557.20 - 6559.20] P:1682.98 E:0.100077 |  to be awarded the free kick
[6559.20 - 6561.20] P:1597.23 E:0.100696 |  you just want to try and play in the Dutch half
[6565.20 - 6567.20] P:1730.72 E:0.114158 |  we have
[6567.20 - 6569.20] P:1769.08 E:0.118350 |  two minutes
[6569.20 - 6571.20] P:1740.46 E:0.098159 |  of normal time remaining
[6571.20 - 6573.20] P:1945.92 E:0.103178 |  the additional time
[6573.20 - 6575.20] P:1902.20 E:0.119934 |  will be fascinating
[6575.20 - 6577.20] P:1911.42 E:0.118251 |  as Ake
[6577.20 - 6579.20] P:1779.48 E:0.122024 |  oh that was a poor poor challenge
[6579.20 - 6581.20] P:1794.80 E:0.120394 |  it's all going off
[6581.20 - 6583.20] P:1800.66 E:0.117790 |  it's all going off
[6583.20 - 6585.20] P:1880.53 E:0.122189 |  mayhem absolute bedlam down below
[6585.20 - 6587.20] P:1868.86 E:0.120546 |  it was a poor challenge
[6587.20 - 6589.20] P:1804.20 E:0.111087 |  in the first place
[6589.20 - 6591.20] P:1698.70 E:0.106253 |  and then
[6591.20 - 6593.20] P:1758.73 E:0.119917 |  think it was Paradez
[6593.20 - 6595.20] P:1934.80 E:0.120654 |  he smashed the ball
[6595.20 - 6597.20] P:1770.70 E:0.104175 |  into the Dutch substitutes
[6597.20 - 6599.20] P:1859.54 E:0.118897 |  and it all kicks off
[6599.20 - 6601.20] P:1759.97 E:0.112187 |  what's the more off
[6601.20 - 6603.20] P:1772.11 E:0.107129 |  what is he thinking of
[6603.20 - 6605.20] P:1764.95 E:0.097427 |  what does he expect
[6605.20 - 6607.20] P:1799.27 E:0.088876 |  Paradez
[6607.20 - 6609.20] P:1756.08 E:0.119723 |  just lost it
[6609.20 - 6611.20] P:1497.76 E:0.120390 |  well
[6611.20 - 6613.20] P:1749.24 E:0.127412 |  everybody's involved down there
[6615.20 - 6617.20] P:1839.03 E:0.124201 |  the most portions in the game
[6617.20 - 6619.20] P:1729.03 E:0.122935 |  actually was in Nuremberg
[6619.20 - 6621.20] P:1811.48 E:0.105636 |  I remember I was at the game Portugal Holland
[6621.20 - 6623.20] P:1617.20 E:0.122009 |  and there were 16
[6623.20 - 6625.20] P:1789.24 E:0.113848 |  on that occasion it included four sendings off
[6625.20 - 6627.20] P:1736.12 E:0.104152 |  what are we up to now
[6627.20 - 6629.20] P:1750.94 E:0.107908 |  hold on I'll tell you in a minute
[6631.20 - 6633.20] P:1766.46 E:0.116158 |  I mean the entire Dutch
[6633.20 - 6635.20] P:1689.44 E:0.070691 |  bench
[6635.20 - 6637.20] P:1746.34 E:0.097382 |  quite rightly were
[6637.20 - 6639.20] P:1919.31 E:0.111583 |  Paradez is shown yellow
[6641.20 - 6643.20] P:1889.21 E:0.106994 |  and he's still not finished
[6643.20 - 6645.20] P:1761.63 E:0.085124 |  well
[6645.20 - 6647.20] P:1809.95 E:0.112967 |  I mean the challenge was
[6647.20 - 6649.20] P:1760.11 E:0.096591 |  a terrible one on Ake
[6649.20 - 6651.20] P:1840.24 E:0.109243 |  late lunging
[6651.20 - 6653.20] P:1999.15 E:0.110395 |  but then it was the way that he just kicked the ball
[6653.20 - 6655.20] P:1958.31 E:0.111757 |  into the Dutch substitutes
[6657.20 - 6659.20] P:2013.81 E:0.117554 |  Van Dijk
[6659.20 - 6661.20] P:2005.24 E:0.123415 |  runs into Paradez
[6661.20 - 6663.20] P:2029.81 E:0.108380 |  doesn't he
[6663.20 - 6665.20] P:1991.57 E:0.117099 |  chest on chest Paradez goes down
[6665.20 - 6667.20] P:1964.81 E:0.120607 |  and then all hell broke loose
[6667.20 - 6669.20] P:2003.25 E:0.109125 |  we're up to eight
[6669.20 - 6671.20] P:2020.12 E:0.114267 |  eight yellow cards
[6671.20 - 6673.20] P:1979.99 E:0.113446 |  last 30 seconds remaining
[6673.20 - 6675.20] P:1886.43 E:0.111962 |  Berghaus sends it in
[6675.20 - 6677.20] P:1897.61 E:0.107958 |  on the stretch done free to the far side
[6677.20 - 6679.20] P:1865.67 E:0.118901 |  goes out of play
[6679.20 - 6681.20] P:1887.94 E:0.125106 |  what's the referee signaling here
[6683.20 - 6685.20] P:1867.14 E:0.126446 |  he's got another one out
[6685.20 - 6687.20] P:1832.18 E:0.110671 |  showing it to the yellow card
[6693.20 - 6695.20] P:1757.20 E:0.128788 |  who was that to
[6695.20 - 6697.20] P:1753.47 E:0.107415 |  he just he
[6697.20 - 6699.20] P:1614.47 E:0.117770 |  in the direction
[6701.20 - 6703.20] P:1708.07 E:0.121178 |  of probably ten players and a couple of benches
[6703.20 - 6705.20] P:1633.68 E:0.106413 |  I mean
[6705.20 - 6707.20] P:1365.25 E:0.120278 |  is he saying number
[6707.20 - 6709.20] P:1776.16 E:0.105966 |  I don't know
[6709.20 - 6711.20] P:1841.18 E:0.113160 |  anyway
[6713.20 - 6715.20] P:1727.73 E:0.096164 |  it's chaos
[6715.20 - 6717.20] P:1844.16 E:0.119391 |  by my watch the 90 minutes
[6717.20 - 6719.20] P:1914.66 E:0.114614 |  to run ten minutes about it on time
[6721.20 - 6723.20] P:1906.81 E:0.126561 |  we're into ten additional minutes
[6723.20 - 6725.20] P:1988.29 E:0.113910 |  they're not happy the Argentinian fans
[6727.20 - 6729.20] P:1879.73 E:0.113602 |  the fun
[6729.20 - 6731.20] P:1834.68 E:0.105152 |  can continue
[6731.20 - 6733.20] P:1615.28 E:0.108537 |  for another ten minutes
[6733.20 - 6735.20] P:1625.30 E:0.112892 |  another bombardment they go long
[6735.20 - 6737.20] P:1712.33 E:0.093394 |  on the stretch
[6737.20 - 6739.20] P:1863.29 E:0.113153 |  that's onto it
[6739.20 - 6741.20] P:1705.91 E:0.111344 |  to Berghaus
[6741.20 - 6743.20] P:1800.72 E:0.110447 |  the referee gives a free kick
[6743.20 - 6745.20] P:1945.15 E:0.114119 |  to the Netherlands just outside the D
[6745.20 - 6747.20] P:1717.29 E:0.104258 |  I've got a feel for the fourth official
[6747.20 - 6749.20] P:1723.49 E:0.106471 |  as well
[6749.20 - 6751.20] P:1621.69 E:0.112897 |  because every time a decision goes
[6751.20 - 6753.20] P:1577.08 E:0.116624 |  every man off the Netherlands benches up
[6753.20 - 6755.20] P:1453.82 E:0.114933 |  and asking for a decision
[6755.20 - 6757.20] P:1318.07 E:0.112442 |  to go in their favour
[6757.20 - 6759.20] P:1673.46 E:0.115700 |  they just haven't
[6759.20 - 6761.20] P:1582.71 E:0.110641 |  been able to cope
[6761.20 - 6763.20] P:1554.43 E:0.086511 |  it was Van Dijk by the way
[6763.20 - 6765.20] P:1698.16 E:0.101029 |  I mean it could have been to anybody
[6765.20 - 6767.20] P:1829.23 E:0.109298 |  you just threw it in the air
[6767.20 - 6769.20] P:1711.18 E:0.110024 |  you're better to say possibly
[6769.20 - 6771.20] P:1598.66 E:0.095731 |  who hasn't been booked
[6773.20 - 6775.20] P:1362.77 E:0.119353 |  this is a
[6775.20 - 6777.20] P:1430.39 E:0.112484 |  a great opportunity
[6777.20 - 6779.20] P:1402.81 E:0.113154 |  what 22
[6779.20 - 6781.20] P:1581.61 E:0.114798 |  23 yards out
[6781.20 - 6783.20] P:1527.60 E:0.104013 |  just on the arc of the
[6783.20 - 6785.20] P:1759.71 E:0.096082 |  the D
[6787.20 - 6789.20] P:1663.23 E:0.111819 |  it's 2-1
[6789.20 - 6791.20] P:1819.81 E:0.105166 |  to Argentina
[6791.20 - 6793.20] P:1717.18 E:0.107198 |  to the second minute of ten
[6793.20 - 6795.20] P:1584.55 E:0.108498 |  to be added on
[6795.20 - 6797.20] P:1616.42 E:0.109739 |  it's a free kick to the Netherlands
[6797.20 - 6799.20] P:1797.57 E:0.113483 |  it's fractured left ascent
[6799.20 - 6801.20] P:1499.44 E:0.115884 |  just outside the D
[6801.20 - 6803.20] P:1246.69 E:0.112302 |  Gatpo is there
[6803.20 - 6805.20] P:1738.38 E:0.113399 |  I think it's suit
[6805.20 - 6807.20] P:1523.44 E:0.103682 |  suit to right foot up
[6807.20 - 6809.20] P:1455.74 E:0.111585 |  right foot up
[6809.20 - 6811.20] P:1543.52 E:0.103041 |  over the wall left hand side of the box
[6811.20 - 6813.20] P:1621.64 E:0.106250 |  away from the goalkeeper
[6815.20 - 6817.20] P:1623.07 E:0.111712 |  well Berghaus is
[6817.20 - 6819.20] P:1453.47 E:0.104182 |  looking really interested
[6819.20 - 6821.20] P:1647.73 E:0.084898 |  so I know he's a left footer
[6821.20 - 6823.20] P:1650.04 E:0.110743 |  Argentina have got everybody
[6823.20 - 6825.20] P:1582.48 E:0.092414 |  back
[6825.20 - 6827.20] P:1745.55 E:0.097745 |  I think it's McAllister who's in the
[6827.20 - 6829.20] P:1958.20 E:0.109898 |  the draft excluded position
[6829.20 - 6831.20] P:1945.78 E:0.099146 |  lying down behind the wall
[6831.20 - 6833.20] P:1956.14 E:0.128389 |  Berghaus into the wall
[6833.20 - 6835.20] P:1938.37 E:0.115473 |  it goes
[6835.20 - 6837.20] P:1866.59 E:0.114813 |  and the cheers
[6837.20 - 6839.20] P:1817.29 E:0.123847 |  from the Argentinian supporters
[6839.20 - 6841.20] P:1850.38 E:0.115867 |  will tell you that that ball did its job
[6841.20 - 6843.20] P:1505.97 E:0.096625 |  very very well
[6843.20 - 6845.20] P:1768.21 E:0.117294 |  by the way the nine yellow cars doesn't include
[6845.20 - 6847.20] P:1699.51 E:0.102838 |  one of the coaching staff from Argentina
[6847.20 - 6849.20] P:1601.26 E:0.109137 |  head injury there has been after
[6849.20 - 6851.20] P:1664.23 E:0.100251 |  a stoppage in play it was a long throw
[6851.20 - 6853.20] P:1605.45 E:0.106787 |  and Ottenmendi and
[6853.20 - 6855.20] P:1492.41 E:0.107097 |  Lisandro Martinez both ran
[6855.20 - 6857.20] P:1655.41 E:0.113464 |  into each other the referee is pointing to
[6857.20 - 6859.20] P:1439.59 E:0.098855 |  his watch
[6859.20 - 6861.20] P:1519.18 E:0.110756 |  it's a nasty one
[6863.20 - 6865.20] P:1348.39 E:0.119379 |  Ottenmendi
[6865.20 - 6867.20] P:1645.33 E:0.115687 |  Martinez is backpedaling
[6867.20 - 6869.20] P:1239.47 E:0.114636 |  Ottenmendi
[6869.20 - 6871.20] P:1385.32 E:0.111246 |  going forward
[6871.20 - 6873.20] P:1592.58 E:0.115207 |  in collision
[6873.20 - 6875.20] P:1562.67 E:0.111143 |  just seeing that Berghaus
[6875.20 - 6877.20] P:1586.80 E:0.119463 |  effort which went narrowly
[6877.20 - 6879.20] P:1592.66 E:0.112103 |  wide I think we both thought it was in
[6879.20 - 6881.20] P:1439.77 E:0.114114 |  the knockdown from
[6881.20 - 6883.20] P:1419.05 E:0.106866 |  Veghors
[6883.20 - 6885.20] P:1513.69 E:0.108338 |  I know at times tonight
[6885.20 - 6887.20] P:1575.90 E:0.102771 |  we've had a little bit of wrestling
[6887.20 - 6889.20] P:1626.87 E:0.101509 |  whether it's a pitch invader
[6889.20 - 6891.20] P:1362.79 E:0.090218 |  being taken to the ground
[6891.20 - 6893.20] P:1487.79 E:0.110161 |  and the warring players that were as well
[6893.20 - 6895.20] P:1725.13 E:0.104547 |  but actually on five live tomorrow night

[6915.20 - 6917.20] P:1498.83 E:0.107474 |  line up
[6917.20 - 6919.20] P:1738.21 E:0.111487 |  in about seven minutes time
[6919.20 - 6921.20] P:1809.64 E:0.111501 |  but we can't say for any great deal of certainty
[6921.20 - 6923.20] P:1856.47 E:0.104389 |  that it will be Croatia
[6923.20 - 6925.20] P:1781.72 E:0.090581 |  against Argentina
[6925.20 - 6927.20] P:1669.85 E:0.095951 |  because the Dutch
[6927.20 - 6929.20] P:1830.70 E:0.111566 |  are going down with the fight
[6929.20 - 6931.20] P:1686.51 E:0.104061 |  as they trail by two goals to one
[6931.20 - 6933.20] P:1695.74 E:0.096660 |  and six minutes remain
[6933.20 - 6935.20] P:1692.38 E:0.107828 |  Bandai at the back
[6935.20 - 6937.20] P:1703.48 E:0.111118 |  Timber
[6937.20 - 6939.20] P:1653.34 E:0.110125 |  Argentina want to be brave with that back
[6939.20 - 6941.20] P:1728.80 E:0.107505 |  line, that back five
[6941.20 - 6943.20] P:1645.43 E:0.109751 |  they want to stay high
[6943.20 - 6945.20] P:1604.02 E:0.111545 |  the Dutch trying to push them back
[6945.20 - 6947.20] P:1532.99 E:0.114313 |  Argentina
[6947.20 - 6949.20] P:1750.69 E:0.105409 |  cannot cope with this barrage
[6949.20 - 6951.20] P:1687.19 E:0.107858 |  long balls knocked down football
[6951.20 - 6953.20] P:1784.85 E:0.110013 |  Veghors gets it out towards
[6953.20 - 6955.20] P:1738.28 E:0.108522 |  Gakpo on the near side the left
[6955.20 - 6957.20] P:1893.95 E:0.107885 |  level of the penalty area quickly closed out
[6957.20 - 6959.20] P:1841.21 E:0.103223 |  and it will not be
[6959.20 - 6961.20] P:1833.76 E:0.105237 |  an Argentina throw
[6961.20 - 6963.20] P:1756.21 E:0.093402 |  despite the best efforts of
[6963.20 - 6965.20] P:1644.84 E:0.100589 |  Leandro Paredes
[6965.20 - 6967.20] P:1634.16 E:0.102083 |  instead it's the opposite number five

[6969.20 - 6971.20] P:1512.20 E:0.095788 |  to pick it up

[6973.20 - 6975.20] P:1555.76 E:0.088221 |  the seconds

[7023.20 - 7025.20] P:1576.65 E:0.119436 |  and they respond

[7067.20 - 7069.20] P:1742.18 E:0.111273 |  that the Dutch will create one more
[7069.20 - 7071.20] P:1820.42 E:0.109634 |  opportunity in these next four minutes
[7071.20 - 7073.20] P:1706.40 E:0.099471 |  headed forward by Paredes

[7095.20 - 7097.20] P:1865.18 E:0.121703 |  and it's the header off target
[7097.20 - 7099.20] P:1796.36 E:0.119261 |  and Emi Martinez doesn't bother
[7099.20 - 7101.20] P:1759.91 E:0.124167 |  about picking up the ball

[7113.20 - 7115.20] P:1624.90 E:0.107570 |  and the Argentinian fans

[7161.20 - 7163.20] P:1731.12 E:0.116410 |  and he gets the free kick
[7163.20 - 7165.20] P:1847.37 E:0.119420 |  and he's on his knees
[7165.20 - 7167.20] P:1852.66 E:0.114432 |  and he does the clinch celebration

[7361.20 - 7363.20] P:1718.34 E:0.112732 |  what an impact the Veghorst has had
[7365.20 - 7367.20] P:1904.05 E:0.120194 |  double Dutch from Veghorst
[7367.20 - 7369.20] P:1805.57 E:0.104624 |  that's all right
[7369.20 - 7371.20] P:1852.55 E:0.120931 |  and we talk about how brutal the Dutch have been
[7373.20 - 7375.20] P:1847.13 E:0.116774 |  and they have just played Huffball
[7375.20 - 7377.20] P:1850.57 E:0.099364 |  but a bit of craft
[7377.20 - 7379.20] P:1801.34 E:0.107543 |  from the free kick
[7379.20 - 7381.20] P:1820.37 E:0.126045 |  you normally see players
[7381.20 - 7383.20] P:1826.39 E:0.107432 |  go for glory from this range
[7383.20 - 7385.20] P:1722.54 E:0.108241 |  but it's Berghuis
[7385.20 - 7387.20] P:1778.39 E:0.120906 |  and he just rolls the ball 10 yards along the floor
[7387.20 - 7389.20] P:1725.36 E:0.116894 |  to the giant Veghorst
[7389.20 - 7391.20] P:1873.30 E:0.113144 |  first touch with his right foot
[7391.20 - 7393.20] P:1778.61 E:0.112492 |  and he swivels
[7393.20 - 7395.20] P:1836.12 E:0.108649 |  and with his enormous left foot
[7395.20 - 7397.20] P:1887.70 E:0.117747 |  it's a toe poke
[7397.20 - 7399.20] P:1845.82 E:0.100401 |  past Martinez
[7399.20 - 7401.20] P:1722.66 E:0.112091 |  into the corner
[7401.20 - 7403.20] P:1757.35 E:0.104492 |  Dutch
[7403.20 - 7405.20] P:1885.50 E:0.103793 |  craft from the free kick
[7405.20 - 7407.20] P:1776.99 E:0.107858 |  from two down
[7407.20 - 7409.20] P:1838.77 E:0.097733 |  they're level
[7409.20 - 7411.20] P:1841.84 E:0.129209 |  Ottenbende has been shown
[7411.20 - 7413.20] P:1734.78 E:0.100373 |  a yellow card
[7413.20 - 7415.20] P:1865.23 E:0.113927 |  that takes the tally to
[7415.20 - 7417.20] P:1824.03 E:0.114414 |  11 now
[7417.20 - 7419.20] P:1727.27 E:0.117337 |  if you include the official
[7419.20 - 7421.20] P:1528.92 E:0.119860 |  the goal was timed
[7423.20 - 7425.20] P:1760.25 E:0.124413 |  in the 101st
[7425.20 - 7427.20] P:1764.82 E:0.109874 |  minute from Vout Veghorst
[7429.20 - 7431.20] P:1652.41 E:0.119503 |  it was a minimum
[7431.20 - 7433.20] P:1571.32 E:0.087297 |  added on of 10
[7433.20 - 7435.20] P:1853.74 E:0.108047 |  the Argentinian players
[7435.20 - 7437.20] P:1755.58 E:0.094879 |  were
[7437.20 - 7439.20] P:1819.88 E:0.108371 |  complaining to the referee
[7441.20 - 7443.20] P:1856.74 E:0.111809 |  and by my watch now
[7443.20 - 7445.20] P:1606.32 E:0.096633 |  that is it
[7445.20 - 7447.20] P:1909.91 E:0.115833 |  and that pocket of Dutch support
[7447.20 - 7449.20] P:1778.95 E:0.103329 |  Messi foul
[7449.20 - 7451.20] P:1780.96 E:0.099525 |  carried on
[7451.20 - 7453.20] P:1890.97 E:0.110275 |  De Jong tries to barge him off the ball
[7453.20 - 7455.20] P:1921.21 E:0.110023 |  rolls it now towards the near side towards Molina
[7455.20 - 7457.20] P:1842.94 E:0.095110 |  the Argentinians
[7457.20 - 7459.20] P:1837.75 E:0.104102 |  are shell-shocked
[7459.20 - 7461.20] P:1849.04 E:0.120544 |  and the referee now blows
[7461.20 - 7463.20] P:1907.45 E:0.110271 |  his whistle
[7463.20 - 7465.20] P:1910.75 E:0.115246 |  and the bench down below
[7465.20 - 7467.20] P:1927.04 E:0.119455 |  and they are complaining
[7467.20 - 7469.20] P:1963.87 E:0.109963 |  towards
[7469.20 - 7471.20] P:1977.08 E:0.113163 |  the Spanish referee
[7471.20 - 7473.20] P:1784.76 E:0.101081 |  words are being said
[7473.20 - 7475.20] P:1885.57 E:0.101945 |  the Dutch players are off their bench as well
[7475.20 - 7477.20] P:1912.79 E:0.101003 |  this isn't good
[7477.20 - 7479.20] P:2033.66 E:0.110962 |  we've got a fight there between
[7479.20 - 7481.20] P:1927.00 E:0.098195 |  one of the reserve goalkeepers
[7481.20 - 7483.20] P:1922.76 E:0.102658 |  it's kicking off again
[7483.20 - 7485.20] P:1773.89 E:0.102954 |  objects are being thrown from the crowd
[7485.20 - 7487.20] P:1975.99 E:0.100594 |  there are plastic bottles being thrown
[7487.20 - 7489.20] P:2031.58 E:0.111403 |  from the Argentinian support behind
[7489.20 - 7491.20] P:1934.74 E:0.097578 |  their dugout and not for the first time
[7491.20 - 7493.20] P:1868.22 E:0.091805 |  this match has descended
[7493.20 - 7495.20] P:1891.64 E:0.096017 |  into Mayhem and Chaos
[7497.20 - 7499.20] P:1540.37 E:0.107770 |  I mean there's both benches
[7501.20 - 7503.20] P:1668.56 E:0.115443 |  on the field
[7503.20 - 7505.20] P:1426.86 E:0.111856 |  a lot of bad feeling
[7505.20 - 7507.20] P:1580.78 E:0.109473 |  it must all be down to
[7507.20 - 7509.20] P:1445.17 E:0.104315 |  how long
[7509.20 - 7511.20] P:1565.29 E:0.110285 |  the referee played
[7511.20 - 7513.20] P:1779.36 E:0.117150 |  it was 10 minutes wasn't it initially
[7513.20 - 7515.20] P:1380.77 E:0.103674 |  Ian
[7517.20 - 7519.20] P:1595.47 E:0.119430 |  the referee
[7519.20 - 7521.20] P:1569.99 E:0.107009 |  the Argentinian
[7521.20 - 7523.20] P:1534.10 E:0.108157 |  substitutes surrounding the referee
[7523.20 - 7525.20] P:1460.26 E:0.096752 |  saying come on
[7525.20 - 7527.20] P:1492.24 E:0.105392 |  how why
[7527.20 - 7529.20] P:1605.48 E:0.113713 |  where did the extra time
[7529.20 - 7531.20] P:1806.92 E:0.073957 |  come from
[7533.20 - 7535.20] P:1839.27 E:0.083344 |  well
[7535.20 - 7537.20] P:1819.33 E:0.096800 |  Kelly we've got another 30 minutes of this
[7537.20 - 7539.20] P:1760.49 E:0.099452 |  and do you know what
[7539.20 - 7541.20] P:1744.10 E:0.089682 |  I'm absolutely delighted
[7541.20 - 7543.20] P:1740.13 E:0.102770 |  this game has had absolutely everything
[7543.20 - 7545.20] P:1631.58 E:0.095773 |  Argentina
[7545.20 - 7547.20] P:1588.46 E:0.107213 |  2-0 up Molina and Messi
[7547.20 - 7549.20] P:1506.80 E:0.106286 |  on the scoresheet
[7549.20 - 7551.20] P:1625.59 E:0.101929 |  Messi with the assist for the first goal
[7551.20 - 7553.20] P:1613.75 E:0.102885 |  both bed costs of Burnley
[7553.20 - 7555.20] P:1627.10 E:0.095551 |  formerly of Burnley
[7555.20 - 7557.20] P:1449.58 E:0.108204 |  with both goals for the Netherlands
[7557.20 - 7559.20] P:1607.15 E:0.088178 |  they brought them level after 90 minutes
[7559.20 - 7561.20] P:1454.15 E:0.119032 |  we've had rumbles on the pitch
[7561.20 - 7563.20] P:1692.22 E:0.102826 |  we've had rumbles in the dugout
[7563.20 - 7565.20] P:1678.20 E:0.104177 |  there was even a pitch invader
[7565.20 - 7567.20] P:1501.48 E:0.100582 |  but I think what was written on his chest
[7567.20 - 7569.20] P:1619.50 E:0.101599 |  was the name of a self-styled prankster
[7569.20 - 7571.20] P:1462.36 E:0.106160 |  so I don't know if he was using that attention
[7571.20 - 7573.20] P:1492.16 E:0.108431 |  for anything more worthwhile than just self-promotion
[7573.20 - 7575.20] P:1750.42 E:0.094229 |  however
[7575.20 - 7577.20] P:1815.17 E:0.091845 |  this game has had
[7577.20 - 7579.20] P:1660.49 E:0.101267 |  it all
[7579.20 - 7581.20] P:1689.10 E:0.096882 |  what it hasn't had yet is ascending off
[7581.20 - 7583.20] P:1505.16 E:0.112555 |  but given how many yellow cards
[7583.20 - 7585.20] P:1734.19 E:0.099186 |  they've already been that might be on the cards
[7585.20 - 7587.20] P:1636.83 E:0.106923 |  over the next 30 minutes as well
[7587.20 - 7589.20] P:1552.35 E:0.116502 |  so Chris, Saty and Ian Dennis are here inside the stadium
[7589.20 - 7591.20] P:1788.27 E:0.104455 |  we're also joined by Tim Vickrey
[7591.20 - 7593.20] P:1628.23 E:0.109407 |  and Mario Melchiot
[7593.20 - 7595.20] P:1587.36 E:0.102238 |  Mario what a way
[7595.20 - 7597.20] P:1581.66 E:0.106100 |  to send this one to extra time for the Netherlands
[7597.20 - 7599.20] P:1667.70 E:0.111691 |  I can't believe this
[7599.20 - 7601.20] P:1501.02 E:0.127509 |  you know Kelly look you prepped for the game
[7601.20 - 7603.20] P:1445.27 E:0.115341 |  and I thought like I'll be honest to you
[7603.20 - 7605.20] P:1156.77 E:0.118044 |  when I was watching the game I thought towards the end
[7605.20 - 7607.20] P:1530.78 E:0.116065 |  I was like it's over
[7607.20 - 7609.20] P:1725.71 E:0.096801 |  but then the way they came back
[7609.20 - 7611.20] P:1237.73 E:0.128573 |  it's exactly the same thing we do for years
[7611.20 - 7613.20] P:1494.27 E:0.113233 |  we have the long balls in the game
[7613.20 - 7615.20] P:1668.91 E:0.112109 |  that's plan B coming from the side
[7615.20 - 7617.20] P:1742.15 E:0.114209 |  and the free kick
[7617.20 - 7619.20] P:1694.99 E:0.107366 |  the way he took the free kick
[7619.20 - 7621.20] P:1404.74 E:0.109085 |  you know called minus they have practiced that
[7621.20 - 7623.20] P:1632.24 E:0.113567 |  because that is not the free kick you normally see
[7623.20 - 7625.20] P:1676.09 E:0.108270 |  he pass them the ball
[7625.20 - 7627.20] P:1681.21 E:0.113371 |  he gets on the turn and he puts it in
[7627.20 - 7629.20] P:1729.57 E:0.107904 |  oh my god I'm telling you Kelly I'm still shocked
[7629.20 - 7631.20] P:1740.47 E:0.103410 |  and still raving
[7631.20 - 7633.20] P:1739.83 E:0.097110 |  such a clever free kick
[7633.20 - 7635.20] P:1740.23 E:0.093915 |  Tim Argentina though
[7635.20 - 7637.20] P:1473.57 E:0.101416 |  are not just shell shot they are
[7637.20 - 7639.20] P:1869.45 E:0.095102 |  furious
[7639.20 - 7641.20] P:1804.01 E:0.105539 |  well yeah they look like people who have just been mugged
[7641.20 - 7643.20] P:1833.60 E:0.087659 |  wandering around in a daze
[7643.20 - 7645.20] P:1770.77 E:0.098183 |  the least experienced coach against the most experienced coach
[7645.20 - 7647.20] P:1843.08 E:0.103710 |  and for most of the game the least experienced coach wins
[7647.20 - 7649.20] P:1811.03 E:0.107299 |  doesn't he
[7649.20 - 7651.20] P:1783.57 E:0.088199 |  they turn Dumfries into a liability in the end
[7651.20 - 7653.20] P:1761.94 E:0.088367 |  with the way that he gave away the penalty
[7653.20 - 7655.20] P:1742.33 E:0.116514 |  but then Holland come roaring back
[7655.20 - 7657.20] P:1636.96 E:0.110757 |  first it's kind of route one
[7657.20 - 7659.20] P:1760.51 E:0.114443 |  long balls everyone up front
[7659.20 - 7661.20] P:1666.23 E:0.098220 |  and then the subtlety of that wonderful free kick
[7661.20 - 7663.20] P:1716.18 E:0.113380 |  it's going to be disputed
[7663.20 - 7665.20] P:1727.36 E:0.100439 |  I don't think Argentina are happy at all
[7665.20 - 7667.20] P:1827.74 E:0.097373 |  about the decision
[7667.20 - 7669.20] P:1613.74 E:0.111189 |  but there it is it's in the back of the net
[7669.20 - 7671.20] P:1701.49 E:0.098783 |  you've got to go and win it all over again
[7671.20 - 7673.20] P:1861.62 E:0.077666 |  we've got another 30 minutes to look forward to
[7673.20 - 7675.20] P:1548.34 E:0.101543 |  and we are looking forward to them very much
[7675.20 - 7677.20] P:1736.64 E:0.103322 |  the players are lined up on the pitch
[7677.20 - 7679.20] P:1695.09 E:0.102387 |  they are almost ready to go
[7679.20 - 7681.20] P:1825.28 E:0.094216 |  Ian Dennis is keeping his BDI
[7681.20 - 7683.20] P:1698.61 E:0.106995 |  on any possible substitutions
[7683.20 - 7685.20] P:1647.16 E:0.098511 |  or maybe he's just looking for another rumble
[7685.20 - 7687.20] P:1732.93 E:0.088164 |  because that's the way he rolls
[7687.20 - 7689.20] P:1570.49 E:0.107590 |  whether you've got the first period of extra time
[7689.20 - 7691.20] P:1588.15 E:0.091137 |  first start in any in Dennis
[7691.20 - 7693.20] P:1803.79 E:0.086207 |  thanks Kelly I was just working out actually
[7693.20 - 7695.20] P:1856.63 E:0.107837 |  before tonight
[7695.20 - 7697.20] P:1780.90 E:0.097787 |  Veghorst three appearances
[7697.20 - 7699.20] P:1901.00 E:0.107354 |  19 minutes he scored two
[7699.20 - 7701.20] P:1864.08 E:0.102052 |  in 18 minutes to take us into extra time
[7701.20 - 7703.20] P:1639.17 E:0.100463 |  for what has been an extremely
[7703.20 - 7705.20] P:1841.65 E:0.105870 |  dramatic night
[7705.20 - 7707.20] P:1703.30 E:0.106508 |  and now all of a sudden as Tim quite rightly says
[7709.20 - 7711.20] P:1772.31 E:0.099498 |  we've got just a different game now
[7711.20 - 7713.20] P:1784.34 E:0.096002 |  because what do the Ducks do now
[7713.20 - 7715.20] P:1963.67 E:0.108754 |  do the Dutch continue to play
[7715.20 - 7717.20] P:1674.41 E:0.105877 |  Route 1 knowing that they can
[7717.20 - 7719.20] P:1669.60 E:0.093599 |  unsettle Argentina
[7719.20 - 7721.20] P:1599.02 E:0.097317 |  yeah
[7721.20 - 7723.20] P:1675.54 E:0.097412 |  or to the
[7723.20 - 7725.20] P:1989.02 E:0.106339 |  why change
[7725.20 - 7727.20] P:1664.60 E:0.082498 |  I mean
[7727.20 - 7729.20] P:1780.41 E:0.116098 |  we've heard a lot about the Dutch style
[7729.20 - 7731.20] P:1772.42 E:0.087820 |  of play throughout this World Cup
[7733.20 - 7735.20] P:1797.69 E:0.093217 |  and the Dutch people back home
[7735.20 - 7737.20] P:1714.71 E:0.096529 |  not happy with
[7737.20 - 7739.20] P:1667.95 E:0.091485 |  the brand of football
[7739.20 - 7741.20] P:1806.44 E:0.095535 |  and you can imagine
[7741.20 - 7743.20] P:1599.87 E:0.084957 |  I can imagine
[7743.20 - 7745.20] P:1710.67 E:0.101491 |  Amsterdam de Jong on
[7745.20 - 7747.20] P:1830.04 E:0.096665 |  Veghorst on
[7747.20 - 7749.20] P:1845.77 E:0.107031 |  the Moans and the Growns
[7749.20 - 7751.20] P:1731.12 E:0.092223 |  but it's worked hasn't it
[7751.20 - 7753.20] P:1818.01 E:0.094161 |  just being direct it's brutal football
[7755.20 - 7757.20] P:1766.15 E:0.103059 |  you know you think about the Dutch influence
[7757.20 - 7759.20] P:1644.92 E:0.089566 |  on football and you know let's play
[7759.20 - 7761.20] P:1793.10 E:0.087924 |  the Dutch way
[7761.20 - 7763.20] P:1802.37 E:0.088007 |  I mean this is as ugly
[7763.20 - 7765.20] P:1859.13 E:0.108614 |  as it can get but it's Louis van der Holt
[7765.20 - 7767.20] P:1827.12 E:0.096707 |  coming into the World Cup
[7767.20 - 7769.20] P:1892.05 E:0.099176 |  said we are going to be effective
[7769.20 - 7771.20] P:1798.92 E:0.083988 |  back three
[7771.20 - 7773.20] P:1814.86 E:0.100738 |  and for attack they can't change
[7773.20 - 7775.20] P:1749.41 E:0.104922 |  why change
[7775.20 - 7777.20] P:1856.33 E:0.118595 |  you know earlier on when we said about the Spanish referee
[7777.20 - 7779.20] P:1902.55 E:0.112172 |  just showing a yellow card to
[7779.20 - 7781.20] P:1683.95 E:0.100096 |  just put it in the air
[7781.20 - 7783.20] P:1713.60 E:0.106063 |  the monitor and the screen here
[7783.20 - 7785.20] P:1775.76 E:0.107032 |  said it was van Dijk that had been booked
[7785.20 - 7787.20] P:1748.11 E:0.096297 |  but then they since changed it
[7787.20 - 7789.20] P:1703.22 E:0.108681 |  but van Dijk during that end of period
[7789.20 - 7791.20] P:1693.43 E:0.094203 |  has now been shown
[7791.20 - 7793.20] P:1751.79 E:0.109143 |  a yellow card so the
[7793.20 - 7795.20] P:1721.92 E:0.104726 |  the yellow card count now I think
[7795.20 - 7797.20] P:1601.45 E:0.102050 |  stands at 12
[7797.20 - 7799.20] P:1369.64 E:0.108800 |  as we're underway
[7799.20 - 7801.20] P:1553.12 E:0.113602 |  I know what you said I think
[7803.20 - 7805.20] P:1676.60 E:0.113125 |  have you seen my notes by the way
[7805.20 - 7807.20] P:1538.50 E:0.121702 |  the first period of extra time
[7807.20 - 7809.20] P:1732.51 E:0.118370 |  you're listening to BBC Radio
[7809.20 - 7811.20] P:1408.65 E:0.102800 |  5 Live and BBC
[7811.20 - 7813.20] P:1649.75 E:0.086344 |  sounds
[7813.20 - 7815.20] P:1542.62 E:0.103886 |  and it was a penalty shootout
[7815.20 - 7817.20] P:1791.43 E:0.106531 |  in Sao Paulo
[7817.20 - 7819.20] P:1554.12 E:0.100650 |  eight years ago
[7819.20 - 7821.20] P:1778.97 E:0.103513 |  we still have the possibility
[7821.20 - 7823.20] P:1765.46 E:0.108800 |  of another shootout as these
[7823.20 - 7825.20] P:1672.22 E:0.103391 |  two sides meet
[7825.20 - 7827.20] P:1813.68 E:0.116575 |  for what is their sixth World Cup meeting
[7829.20 - 7831.20] P:1892.78 E:0.122774 |  and I would think that the Argentinian supporters inside
[7831.20 - 7833.20] P:1855.78 E:0.107173 |  this Lucille Stadium
[7833.20 - 7835.20] P:1814.81 E:0.102571 |  will be emotionally drained
[7835.20 - 7837.20] P:1786.41 E:0.107357 |  they've given it everything
[7837.20 - 7839.20] P:1803.76 E:0.103461 |  the way that they've cheered and danced
[7839.20 - 7841.20] P:1806.53 E:0.099989 |  and bellowed
[7841.20 - 7843.20] P:1760.28 E:0.103554 |  and then to have the agony
[7843.20 - 7845.20] P:1663.51 E:0.087520 |  of a 101st minute equaliser
[7845.20 - 7847.20] P:1713.83 E:0.102543 |  they'll be absolutely shot
[7847.20 - 7849.20] P:1687.34 E:0.092118 |  but
[7849.20 - 7851.20] P:1468.51 E:0.100857 |  Argentina in their blue and white
[7851.20 - 7853.20] P:1675.30 E:0.082835 |  striked shirts
[7853.20 - 7855.20] P:1740.84 E:0.097562 |  playing from right to left as we look
[7855.20 - 7857.20] P:1601.19 E:0.090796 |  against the Netherlands
[7857.20 - 7859.20] P:1405.19 E:0.085786 |  all in orange
[7859.20 - 7861.20] P:1609.08 E:0.110352 |  Argentina
[7861.20 - 7863.20] P:1568.69 E:0.091245 |  in possession
[7863.20 - 7865.20] P:1630.16 E:0.103648 |  and now out to this
[7865.20 - 7867.20] P:1485.53 E:0.102844 |  near side
[7867.20 - 7869.20] P:1532.42 E:0.093310 |  for
[7869.20 - 7871.20] P:1657.93 E:0.108662 |  Cassandra Martinez, Talia Fico
[7871.20 - 7873.20] P:1598.31 E:0.100890 |  forward, McAllister
[7873.20 - 7875.20] P:1613.65 E:0.107461 |  so we've got
[7875.20 - 7877.20] P:1605.95 E:0.121856 |  Emi Martinez, we've got Molina
[7877.20 - 7879.20] P:1508.39 E:0.104557 |  Hermaine Pesella
[7879.20 - 7881.20] P:1584.70 E:0.097064 |  Nicolás Otamendi
[7881.20 - 7883.20] P:1671.59 E:0.098059 |  Cassandra Martinez
[7883.20 - 7885.20] P:1689.38 E:0.108272 |  and Talia Fico in the field of
[7885.20 - 7887.20] P:1683.19 E:0.097385 |  Fernandez and Paredes, Messi
[7887.20 - 7889.20] P:1677.92 E:0.105990 |  and Artarón Martinez for
[7889.20 - 7891.20] P:1547.29 E:0.086130 |  Argentina
[7891.20 - 7893.20] P:1826.43 E:0.107538 |  for the Dutch who are now playing a flatback
[7893.20 - 7895.20] P:1585.08 E:0.097976 |  for, Nopper is in goal
[7895.20 - 7897.20] P:1594.01 E:0.112333 |  it's Timber as the right back
[7897.20 - 7899.20] P:1564.30 E:0.087929 |  sorry, Dumfries is the right back
[7899.20 - 7901.20] P:1659.63 E:0.102507 |  Timber and Van Dijk in the centre
[7901.20 - 7903.20] P:1567.97 E:0.091510 |  Ake at left back
[7903.20 - 7905.20] P:1430.96 E:0.103828 |  you've then got Frankie Dion
[7905.20 - 7907.20] P:1663.69 E:0.094460 |  and Cube Minas
[7907.20 - 7909.20] P:1850.56 E:0.108365 |  with Gatpo Burghus and Begg Horst
[7909.20 - 7911.20] P:1402.23 E:0.086365 |  and Luke Dion
[7911.20 - 7913.20] P:1576.03 E:0.105637 |  and just incredible drama
[7913.20 - 7915.20] P:1640.36 E:0.101339 |  incredible drama
[7915.20 - 7917.20] P:1407.83 E:0.101088 |  oh it isn't
[7917.20 - 7919.20] P:1619.70 E:0.115734 |  now I think Argentina
[7919.20 - 7921.20] P:1620.42 E:0.105040 |  just trying to make some passes
[7921.20 - 7923.20] P:1371.09 E:0.105348 |  try and get a foothold
[7923.20 - 7925.20] P:1568.52 E:0.095880 |  back in this game
[7925.20 - 7927.20] P:1568.26 E:0.099175 |  the players
[7927.20 - 7929.20] P:1619.05 E:0.099196 |  I think pretty much shell
[7929.20 - 7931.20] P:1616.11 E:0.101362 |  shocked with the Dutch equaliser
[7931.20 - 7933.20] P:1612.89 E:0.100214 |  you think all
[7933.20 - 7935.20] P:1844.95 E:0.114118 |  throughout extra time
[7935.20 - 7937.20] P:1736.64 E:0.112585 |  every free kick which was awarded
[7937.20 - 7939.20] P:1777.03 E:0.111836 |  every time the ball went out of play
[7939.20 - 7941.20] P:1782.89 E:0.101974 |  the Argentinian players
[7941.20 - 7943.20] P:1728.44 E:0.083068 |  the crowd up
[7943.20 - 7945.20] P:1757.76 E:0.109035 |  it took a leaf
[7945.20 - 7947.20] P:1575.86 E:0.102835 |  after the men from down under
[7947.20 - 7949.20] P:1519.21 E:0.094295 |  went up and under
[7949.20 - 7951.20] P:1746.44 E:0.107664 |  and it paid off for them
[7951.20 - 7953.20] P:1779.91 E:0.095920 |  Australia came close
[7953.20 - 7955.20] P:1786.39 E:0.092939 |  but Begg Horst
[7955.20 - 7957.20] P:1690.62 E:0.112349 |  I wonder if there was
[7957.20 - 7959.20] P:1417.50 E:0.096992 |  somebody in
[7959.20 - 7961.20] P:1732.61 E:0.103358 |  Lancashire tonight a Burnley supporter
[7961.20 - 7963.20] P:1701.00 E:0.094158 |  thinking he never did that for us
[7965.20 - 7967.20] P:1603.80 E:0.121052 |  I've got to say I thought the
[7967.20 - 7969.20] P:1745.78 E:0.096345 |  free kick was beautifully worked
[7969.20 - 7971.20] P:1806.44 E:0.099924 |  but the award of the free kick was the right
[7971.20 - 7973.20] P:1394.90 E:0.072806 |  decision
[7973.20 - 7975.20] P:1589.13 E:0.107604 |  I think some of the Argentinian players
[7975.20 - 7977.20] P:1457.43 E:0.077459 |  simply
[7977.20 - 7979.20] P:1893.72 E:0.110911 |  were over aggressive weren't they
[7979.20 - 7981.20] P:1582.26 E:0.087416 |  in the last 10-15 minutes
[7981.20 - 7983.20] P:1545.47 E:0.094137 |  Paredes
[7983.20 - 7985.20] P:1345.83 E:0.100405 |  on the ball now being one of them
[7985.20 - 7987.20] P:1440.49 E:0.096567 |  Paredes plays it in low
[7987.20 - 7989.20] P:1824.51 E:0.113638 |  Fernandez able to turn
[7989.20 - 7991.20] P:1756.55 E:0.109301 |  Lattaro Martinez was ahead of him
[7991.20 - 7993.20] P:1782.44 E:0.101285 |  instead he opts to give it right
[7993.20 - 7995.20] P:1790.03 E:0.105212 |  towards Messi
[7995.20 - 7997.20] P:1861.46 E:0.102311 |  Messi kills over the cross tell you Fico
[7997.20 - 7999.20] P:1955.81 E:0.110448 |  he's off his chest it's need forward
[7999.20 - 8001.20] P:1909.81 E:0.112033 |  and then the header back by De Jong
[8001.20 - 8003.20] P:1903.39 E:0.106184 |  was superb because there was a certain figure
[8003.20 - 8005.20] P:1712.69 E:0.116241 |  wouldn't say he was looming
[8005.20 - 8007.20] P:1762.08 E:0.105421 |  not to sure that he can loom
[8007.20 - 8009.20] P:1767.31 E:0.109782 |  Messi in terms of the size difference
[8009.20 - 8011.20] P:1917.29 E:0.107830 |  between the two but he was just thinking
[8011.20 - 8013.20] P:1832.75 E:0.095638 |  of an acrobatic effort was little Messi
[8013.20 - 8015.20] P:1719.10 E:0.109279 |  yes he was he was loitering
[8015.20 - 8017.20] P:1717.60 E:0.092976 |  wasn't he Messi as the ball
[8017.20 - 8019.20] P:1708.11 E:0.101949 |  Martinez is right
[8019.20 - 8021.20] P:1622.35 E:0.106422 |  there he just helps the ball
[8021.20 - 8023.20] P:1438.88 E:0.096972 |  on and
[8023.20 - 8025.20] P:1540.96 E:0.113825 |  thank you De Jong
[8025.20 - 8027.20] P:1931.24 E:0.107771 |  as you like coolest head in the stadium
[8027.20 - 8029.20] P:1572.93 E:0.098352 |  it's it back to Nopper
[8029.20 - 8031.20] P:1750.99 E:0.098228 |  I'll be surprised if we
[8031.20 - 8033.20] P:1724.29 E:0.100607 |  if we don't see red in this game tonight
[8033.20 - 8035.20] P:1261.41 E:0.109529 |  won't you
[8035.20 - 8037.20] P:1430.89 E:0.115948 |  yeah absolutely
[8037.20 - 8039.20] P:1492.92 E:0.100209 |  I'll be surprised if we didn't see another
[8041.20 - 8043.20] P:1238.39 E:0.117439 |  two three four
[8043.20 - 8045.20] P:1352.39 E:0.087033 |  guards in this
[8045.20 - 8047.20] P:1457.88 E:0.066943 |  extra time
[8047.20 - 8049.20] P:1420.09 E:0.080125 |  just
[8049.20 - 8051.20] P:1551.02 E:0.097648 |  it's gonna be interesting
[8051.20 - 8053.20] P:1709.58 E:0.095542 |  fascinated will the Dutch
[8053.20 - 8055.20] P:1638.49 E:0.085181 |  change the way that they play
[8055.20 - 8057.20] P:1480.83 E:0.098684 |  what worked was getting
[8057.20 - 8059.20] P:1767.42 E:0.093040 |  crosses in the box wasn't it
[8059.20 - 8061.20] P:1761.51 E:0.091208 |  being direct
[8061.20 - 8063.20] P:1727.65 E:0.099851 |  wasn't that the question I posed for you at the start
[8063.20 - 8065.20] P:1791.47 E:0.107105 |  in comes the cross from Gakpo
[8065.20 - 8067.20] P:1768.30 E:0.114743 |  I mean Martinez
[8067.20 - 8069.20] P:1680.47 E:0.103709 |  dropping back to his goal line
[8069.20 - 8071.20] P:1847.99 E:0.109120 |  safely watched it over onto the roof of the net
[8071.20 - 8073.20] P:1794.61 E:0.099236 |  now for a goal kick to two
[8073.20 - 8075.20] P:1620.22 E:0.099075 |  you got Gakpo
[8075.20 - 8077.20] P:1712.66 E:0.110089 |  off that left hand side
[8077.20 - 8079.20] P:1612.95 E:0.082386 |  for the Dutch

[8235.20 - 8237.20] P:1838.40 E:0.110236 |  what I would say
[8237.20 - 8239.20] P:1786.54 E:0.115788 |  is that if Argentina do go home
[8239.20 - 8241.20] P:1596.41 E:0.084523 |  tonight
[8241.20 - 8243.20] P:1823.63 E:0.105539 |  this World Cup

[8247.20 - 8249.20] P:1729.70 E:0.091819 |  here in Qatar
[8249.20 - 8251.20] P:1651.54 E:0.098655 |  absolutely
[8251.20 - 8253.20] P:1624.79 E:0.088677 |  I think the neutral
[8253.20 - 8255.20] P:1569.70 E:0.087389 |  would like
[8255.20 - 8257.20] P:1518.55 E:0.088450 |  Argentina
[8257.20 - 8259.20] P:1543.72 E:0.083109 |  to stay in the competition

[8263.20 - 8265.20] P:1750.76 E:0.108426 |  Fernandez plays it out towards Molina
[8265.20 - 8267.20] P:1608.47 E:0.088139 |  comes in off that right hand side
[8267.20 - 8269.20] P:1797.44 E:0.113985 |  Argentina are attacking right to left
[8269.20 - 8271.20] P:1898.61 E:0.114042 |  back towards Messi

[8273.20 - 8275.20] P:1856.01 E:0.114717 |  Berg who plays it forward
[8275.20 - 8277.20] P:1788.34 E:0.110745 |  Luftiong makes the run
[8277.20 - 8279.20] P:1893.08 E:0.101700 |  right hand side
[8279.20 - 8281.20] P:1897.79 E:0.104692 |  Luong needs some support
[8281.20 - 8283.20] P:2098.92 E:0.117397 |  comes in the shape of Berg
[8283.20 - 8285.20] P:2109.64 E:0.114851 |  who's inside now towards
[8285.20 - 8287.20] P:2037.22 E:0.094343 |  Luong
[8289.20 - 8291.20] P:1744.64 E:0.111169 |  to Luftiong
[8291.20 - 8293.20] P:1804.41 E:0.114261 |  and there is a foul on Luftiong
[8293.20 - 8295.20] P:1784.74 E:0.107728 |  and this means
[8295.20 - 8297.20] P:1708.21 E:0.104773 |  that the Netherlands have a free kick
[8297.20 - 8299.20] P:1749.89 E:0.091072 |  and once again
[8299.20 - 8301.20] P:1810.05 E:0.102140 |  they will be a threat at this set piece
[8301.20 - 8303.20] P:1619.43 E:0.097030 |  with their aerial threat
[8303.20 - 8305.20] P:1438.59 E:0.113526 |  absolutely

[8319.20 - 8321.20] P:1429.99 E:0.104327 |  so what happened
[8321.20 - 8323.20] P:1622.89 E:0.113363 |  of the last free kick and they worked something special
[8323.20 - 8325.20] P:1583.68 E:0.104289 |  clever with this one
[8325.20 - 8327.20] P:1656.98 E:0.099384 |  Berg who's to take it

[8333.20 - 8335.20] P:1759.32 E:0.102544 |  and there's a foul
[8335.20 - 8337.20] P:1728.73 E:0.106611 |  there was a collision
[8337.20 - 8339.20] P:1567.99 E:0.109851 |  and it was
[8339.20 - 8341.20] P:1676.27 E:0.102993 |  that was fouled by Dumfries
[8341.20 - 8343.20] P:1611.09 E:0.094105 |  it will be a free kick to Argentina
[8343.20 - 8345.20] P:1603.38 E:0.108571 |  about Berghorst at Burnley
[8345.20 - 8347.20] P:1604.28 E:0.093707 |  in the Premier League
[8347.20 - 8349.20] P:1826.19 E:0.106880 |  1457 minutes

[8357.20 - 8359.20] P:1722.72 E:0.112953 |  not that that would make anybody
[8359.20 - 8361.20] P:1808.44 E:0.105848 |  who supports Burnley feel any better
[8361.20 - 8363.20] P:1836.42 E:0.098668 |  so Tony Livese if you're listening
[8367.20 - 8369.20] P:1755.85 E:0.104893 |  Dumfries
[8369.20 - 8371.20] P:1680.92 E:0.103577 |  with the back pass
[8371.20 - 8373.20] P:1821.93 E:0.098152 |  actually since he's gone to Besiktas
[8373.20 - 8375.20] P:1795.36 E:0.114088 |  he scored six goals in 14 appearances
[8375.20 - 8377.20] P:1692.14 E:0.099129 |  for the
[8377.20 - 8379.20] P:1765.84 E:0.097593 |  Turkish side
[8379.20 - 8381.20] P:1770.50 E:0.103767 |  as there's a little bit of off the ball
[8381.20 - 8383.20] P:1854.39 E:0.125396 |  it was nothing, oh that was something sinister though
[8383.20 - 8385.20] P:1858.12 E:0.118512 |  because all of a sudden
[8385.20 - 8387.20] P:1933.90 E:0.109520 |  that was Timber
[8387.20 - 8389.20] P:1869.21 E:0.120894 |  it was involved and the referee has blown his whistle
[8389.20 - 8391.20] P:1937.64 E:0.111790 |  despite Argentina
[8391.20 - 8393.20] P:1848.29 E:0.112097 |  attacking
[8393.20 - 8395.20] P:1882.51 E:0.105662 |  now Timber is on a yellow car
[8395.20 - 8397.20] P:1933.55 E:0.114774 |  and Messi was the one
[8397.20 - 8399.20] P:1915.30 E:0.108045 |  who went to ground and the referee
[8401.20 - 8403.20] P:1882.14 E:0.118284 |  has given a free kick
[8403.20 - 8405.20] P:1777.94 E:0.085926 |  VAL will be having a look at it
[8405.20 - 8407.20] P:1706.61 E:0.108288 |  yeah it's uh
[8407.20 - 8409.20] P:1712.17 E:0.100211 |  Messi turns to make a run and it's an accidental collision
[8409.20 - 8411.20] P:1656.06 E:0.083400 |  I think
[8411.20 - 8413.20] P:1632.25 E:0.083975 |  just really
[8413.20 - 8415.20] P:1740.81 E:0.104242 |  cute with his movement Messi
[8415.20 - 8417.20] P:1576.13 E:0.073827 |  shapes out like he's
[8417.20 - 8419.20] P:1728.92 E:0.101489 |  shapes out like he's
[8419.20 - 8421.20] P:1714.12 E:0.107145 |  moving towards the ball
[8421.20 - 8423.20] P:1694.38 E:0.093954 |  turns and runs into
[8423.20 - 8425.20] P:1839.41 E:0.116835 |  to Timber
[8425.20 - 8427.20] P:1941.87 E:0.121426 |  Timber fails
[8427.20 - 8429.20] P:1955.15 E:0.123305 |  Messi
[8429.20 - 8431.20] P:2020.90 E:0.117544 |  you can hear what the Argentinian fans think of it
[8431.20 - 8433.20] P:2035.21 E:0.112677 |  that decision not to award a yellow card
[8435.20 - 8437.20] P:1984.12 E:0.109459 |  four and a half minutes of this first period of extra time
[8441.20 - 8443.20] P:1914.12 E:0.114268 |  live on five live to go
[8443.20 - 8445.20] P:1758.25 E:0.086313 |  Messi to take a free kick
[8445.20 - 8447.20] P:1817.31 E:0.107841 |  not quite midway through the Netherlands
[8447.20 - 8449.20] P:1852.31 E:0.095941 |  half
[8449.20 - 8451.20] P:1701.25 E:0.094699 |  left footed doesn't be the first man
[8451.20 - 8453.20] P:1781.99 E:0.096038 |  headed out by Timber but the Dutch had everybody back
[8453.20 - 8455.20] P:1756.29 E:0.108981 |  every orange shirt was in and around their own penalty area there
[8455.20 - 8457.20] P:1657.11 E:0.088688 |  back towards Messi
[8457.20 - 8459.20] P:1721.33 E:0.094934 |  goes long again
[8459.20 - 8461.20] P:1693.47 E:0.101027 |  and over the head of Arcade
[8461.20 - 8463.20] P:1929.66 E:0.110030 |  and it's that support
[8463.20 - 8465.20] P:1729.56 E:0.090402 |  that cheered up because it'll be a goal kick
[8465.20 - 8467.20] P:1717.70 E:0.077784 |  and we have
[8467.20 - 8469.20] P:1685.62 E:0.100854 |  the chance to get another breather
[8469.20 - 8471.20] P:1597.46 E:0.093507 |  a little bit surprised at that
[8471.20 - 8473.20] P:1474.09 E:0.104140 |  Messi
[8473.20 - 8475.20] P:1349.60 E:0.079309 |  whipping the ball in from the free kick
[8475.20 - 8477.20] P:1707.11 E:0.101170 |  and Argentina
[8477.20 - 8479.20] P:1658.41 E:0.082070 |  trying to
[8479.20 - 8481.20] P:1462.59 E:0.108926 |  to work something
[8481.20 - 8483.20] P:1573.05 E:0.078224 |  try and play down the side
[8483.20 - 8485.20] P:1550.90 E:0.096044 |  of the Dutch defence
[8485.20 - 8487.20] P:1540.59 E:0.093395 |  looks like they've just run out of ideas
[8487.20 - 8489.20] P:1660.81 E:0.111572 |  Argentina
[8493.20 - 8495.20] P:1642.80 E:0.115266 |  we have Son and Frolix on five live this Friday night
[8499.20 - 8501.20] P:1841.18 E:0.114168 |  and we could still have a penalty shootout
[8501.20 - 8503.20] P:1663.45 E:0.090675 |  as well
[8503.20 - 8505.20] P:1917.56 E:0.116627 |  in 2014 it was Argentina
[8505.20 - 8507.20] P:1786.65 E:0.108620 |  in that semi-final in Sao Paulo
[8507.20 - 8509.20] P:1518.15 E:0.097499 |  that went through
[8509.20 - 8511.20] P:1478.84 E:0.082899 |  four to
[8511.20 - 8513.20] P:1501.87 E:0.098323 |  the Dutch
[8513.20 - 8515.20] P:1826.38 E:0.124587 |  have a dreadful record
[8515.20 - 8517.20] P:1874.88 E:0.114136 |  when it comes to penalties
[8517.20 - 8519.20] P:1797.02 E:0.079031 |  they've won only two of seven
[8519.20 - 8521.20] P:1864.46 E:0.099392 |  shootouts at major tournaments
[8521.20 - 8523.20] P:1805.24 E:0.097597 |  cleared away
[8523.20 - 8525.20] P:1443.27 E:0.085683 |  mind you
[8525.20 - 8527.20] P:1785.96 E:0.104336 |  they've got Noffer at six for eight
[8527.20 - 8529.20] P:1739.27 E:0.097602 |  for the Messi penalty did he
[8529.20 - 8531.20] P:1824.03 E:0.110808 |  put Argentina to the look
[8531.20 - 8533.20] P:1714.79 E:0.094258 |  and at that stage
[8533.20 - 8535.20] P:1763.23 E:0.094990 |  you really did think that they were set for that date
[8535.20 - 8537.20] P:1777.47 E:0.099970 |  with Croatia
[8537.20 - 8539.20] P:1880.30 E:0.104475 |  Paulo on the callister
[8539.20 - 8541.20] P:1867.02 E:0.102493 |  by Dumfries free kick to Argentina
[8541.20 - 8543.20] P:1682.28 E:0.089442 |  on the half way line
[8543.20 - 8545.20] P:1764.83 E:0.105004 |  you still sense this could
[8545.20 - 8547.20] P:1651.04 E:0.089413 |  really bubble over
[8547.20 - 8549.20] P:1648.28 E:0.076421 |  an extra time
[8551.20 - 8553.20] P:1716.21 E:0.098317 |  so 2014 was
[8553.20 - 8555.20] P:1604.71 E:0.098291 |  Tim Kruel came on
[8555.20 - 8557.20] P:1716.76 E:0.093642 |  the previous
[8557.20 - 8559.20] P:1708.87 E:0.102005 |  round
[8559.20 - 8561.20] P:1671.05 E:0.094652 |  another free kick to Argentina
[8561.20 - 8563.20] P:1636.05 E:0.107788 |  and then he didn't
[8563.20 - 8565.20] P:1676.72 E:0.105475 |  hold Tim Kruel off
[8565.20 - 8567.20] P:1803.98 E:0.096702 |  he wanted to take a quick free kick
[8567.20 - 8569.20] P:1881.61 E:0.110950 |  sorry I thought they were going to do
[8569.20 - 8571.20] P:1853.72 E:0.110502 |  what I would say is that
[8571.20 - 8573.20] P:1889.48 E:0.104453 |  Alexander Arnold would take a quick one
[8573.20 - 8575.20] P:1874.45 E:0.113602 |  but the referee had blown his whistle
[8575.20 - 8577.20] P:1893.43 E:0.107294 |  and he wanted it on the whistle
[8577.20 - 8579.20] P:1839.19 E:0.102545 |  Tim has got to be careful because this is
[8579.20 - 8581.20] P:1727.45 E:0.083271 |  persistent fouling
[8581.20 - 8583.20] P:1724.91 E:0.104518 |  Tim Valens another yellow
[8583.20 - 8585.20] P:1746.05 E:0.100289 |  of course
[8587.20 - 8589.20] P:1713.42 E:0.102671 |  he's seeing red
[8589.20 - 8591.20] P:1803.65 E:0.109788 |  it's a free kick to Argentina
[8591.20 - 8593.20] P:1723.22 E:0.098174 |  it's a central position
[8593.20 - 8595.20] P:1761.46 E:0.112971 |  we have under two minutes of this first period of extra time
[8599.20 - 8601.20] P:1672.07 E:0.093848 |  Messi
[8601.20 - 8603.20] P:1802.10 E:0.115168 |  left-footed clips it on the stretch
[8603.20 - 8605.20] P:1959.83 E:0.112553 |  unable just to get on the end was Otten Mendy
[8605.20 - 8607.20] P:1872.21 E:0.099767 |  he threw himself at it
[8607.20 - 8609.20] P:1854.86 E:0.091617 |  with a trailing right leg
[8609.20 - 8611.20] P:1707.14 E:0.084000 |  and out of play it goes for a goal kick
[8611.20 - 8613.20] P:1588.98 E:0.096030 |  not far away
[8613.20 - 8615.20] P:1624.93 E:0.089638 |  Otten Mendy you normally see
[8617.20 - 8619.20] P:1740.52 E:0.114209 |  Tim's trying to create more of an angle
[8619.20 - 8621.20] P:1758.92 E:0.080613 |  but from a fairly central position
[8623.20 - 8625.20] P:1659.99 E:0.113244 |  just slightly right hand side of centre
[8625.20 - 8627.20] P:1699.08 E:0.100608 |  Messi left-footed curls the ball
[8627.20 - 8629.20] P:1751.62 E:0.090996 |  over the
[8629.20 - 8631.20] P:1635.18 E:0.089110 |  Dutch backline
[8631.20 - 8633.20] P:1691.93 E:0.095200 |  Otten Mendy at full stretch
[8633.20 - 8635.20] P:1668.29 E:0.097112 |  wouldn't quite get that big right boot to it
[8635.20 - 8637.20] P:1702.39 E:0.100326 |  still two-two
[8637.20 - 8639.20] P:1891.98 E:0.096495 |  a little bit of hesitation eventually the ball is picked up
[8639.20 - 8641.20] P:1717.63 E:0.109671 |  by Emi Martinez all in red
[8641.20 - 8643.20] P:1648.78 E:0.086621 |  away towards our right hand side
[8643.20 - 8645.20] P:1635.97 E:0.109537 |  the Tim Kruel Heroics
[8645.20 - 8647.20] P:1764.95 E:0.095364 |  was against Costa Rica
[8647.20 - 8649.20] P:1694.97 E:0.113069 |  in the quarter-final
[8649.20 - 8651.20] P:1768.39 E:0.097477 |  they actually came here with a very
[8651.20 - 8653.20] P:1680.66 E:0.097144 |  inexperienced
[8653.20 - 8655.20] P:1806.54 E:0.093845 |  set of goalkeepers really
[8655.20 - 8657.20] P:1660.35 E:0.095345 |  because before this tournament
[8657.20 - 8659.20] P:1679.71 E:0.101208 |  Nopper was on caps
[8659.20 - 8661.20] P:1582.43 E:0.089444 |  and you had
[8661.20 - 8663.20] P:1765.57 E:0.093899 |  Passfield with two caps
[8663.20 - 8665.20] P:1469.00 E:0.094535 |  and the other one
[8665.20 - 8667.20] P:1716.61 E:0.109679 |  play out with only six
[8669.20 - 8671.20] P:1634.97 E:0.109247 |  Nopper now at 28 years of age
[8671.20 - 8673.20] P:1723.47 E:0.094975 |  keeper of Helen Vane
[8673.20 - 8675.20] P:1659.03 E:0.100454 |  looking to establish himself
[8675.20 - 8677.20] P:1659.20 E:0.086084 |  as the number one
[8677.20 - 8679.20] P:1794.37 E:0.103451 |  after forcing out Silicen
[8679.20 - 8681.20] P:1737.29 E:0.093711 |  the Dutch turn
[8681.20 - 8683.20] P:1740.15 E:0.087204 |  through to Yong
[8683.20 - 8685.20] P:1810.99 E:0.108622 |  all in orange playing from left to right
[8685.20 - 8687.20] P:1892.25 E:0.103926 |  and the first period of extra time
[8687.20 - 8689.20] P:1720.20 E:0.094929 |  is now over
[8689.20 - 8691.20] P:1876.55 E:0.112292 |  it's still Netherlands two
[8691.20 - 8693.20] P:1892.25 E:0.097338 |  Argentina two
[8693.20 - 8695.20] P:1700.16 E:0.107657 |  Chris
[8695.20 - 8697.20] P:1807.13 E:0.107819 |  Yeah I mean that first period of extra time
[8697.20 - 8699.20] P:1834.10 E:0.108975 |  with the drama we had
[8699.20 - 8701.20] P:1677.01 E:0.104026 |  during the 90 minutes was
[8701.20 - 8703.20] P:1743.90 E:0.109794 |  a pretty tepid affair
[8703.20 - 8705.20] P:1846.13 E:0.105646 |  I've got to say I'm a little bit surprised
[8705.20 - 8707.20] P:1915.56 E:0.103656 |  in that the Dutch who finished the game
[8707.20 - 8709.20] P:1880.69 E:0.092584 |  so strongly
[8709.20 - 8711.20] P:1621.96 E:0.110086 |  blood and thunder balls into the box
[8711.20 - 8713.20] P:1669.09 E:0.102825 |  didn't really trouble
[8713.20 - 8715.20] P:1484.67 E:0.099674 |  Argentina but
[8715.20 - 8717.20] P:1219.72 E:0.112373 |  Argentina seemed to have
[8717.20 - 8719.20] P:1547.95 E:0.098789 |  maybe just lost the nerve
[8721.20 - 8723.20] P:1430.72 E:0.119806 |  really create anything of note
[8723.20 - 8725.20] P:1560.73 E:0.112476 |  Will one of these
[8725.20 - 8727.20] P:1717.61 E:0.104724 |  well who's going to be bravest
[8727.20 - 8729.20] P:1749.20 E:0.111047 |  in the second half of extra time
[8729.20 - 8731.20] P:1755.49 E:0.089009 |  or are they already thinking both teams
[8731.20 - 8733.20] P:1814.06 E:0.077766 |  about penalties
[8733.20 - 8735.20] P:1846.25 E:0.092363 |  Kelly
[8735.20 - 8737.20] P:1502.49 E:0.110318 |  Mario Melchiot is also with us Mario
[8737.20 - 8739.20] P:1672.77 E:0.106926 |  do they look to you like the Netherlands
[8739.20 - 8741.20] P:1836.30 E:0.081822 |  are already thinking of penalties
[8741.20 - 8743.20] P:1476.39 E:0.127663 |  Yeah definitely I think this game is going to come
[8743.20 - 8745.20] P:1726.37 E:0.110954 |  through that moment because you know if it stays
[8745.20 - 8747.20] P:1503.99 E:0.120527 |  like this of course and you know what the key
[8747.20 - 8749.20] P:1662.03 E:0.112253 |  things what I'm worried about is like
[8749.20 - 8751.20] P:1608.03 E:0.116752 |  what the guys already mentioned I don't want
[8751.20 - 8753.20] P:1412.33 E:0.113648 |  any of us to get another card because
[8753.20 - 8755.20] P:1681.17 E:0.109507 |  for example Timber
[8755.20 - 8757.20] P:1762.38 E:0.125136 |  he's looking really dangerous
[8757.20 - 8759.20] P:1562.01 E:0.115052 |  I don't want anything to happen because
[8759.20 - 8761.20] P:1795.01 E:0.101007 |  if this game gets to penalties
[8761.20 - 8763.20] P:1760.53 E:0.104604 |  hopefully we practice enough
[8763.20 - 8765.20] P:1631.27 E:0.114528 |  so we can get it going because
[8765.20 - 8767.20] P:1774.77 E:0.103366 |  normally
[8767.20 - 8769.20] P:1712.71 E:0.102952 |  what Argentina has is that
[8769.20 - 8771.20] P:1565.68 E:0.109383 |  when the battle goes on
[8771.20 - 8773.20] P:1307.27 E:0.124301 |  it's a normality for them they know how to battle
[8773.20 - 8775.20] P:1708.50 E:0.103242 |  and that is sometimes
[8775.20 - 8777.20] P:1660.00 E:0.107252 |  we as Dutchies don't always know how to do it
[8777.20 - 8779.20] P:1565.18 E:0.113315 |  but now I think they're holding firm
[8779.20 - 8781.20] P:1455.45 E:0.122097 |  and they're doing well so let's see if they can pull this one out
[8783.20 - 8785.20] P:1905.28 E:0.115286 |  Mario it's been really good talking to you
[8785.20 - 8787.20] P:1736.26 E:0.111827 |  thank you very much for joining us this evening
[8787.20 - 8789.20] P:1647.33 E:0.105684 |  what a game to be part of for us
[8789.20 - 8791.20] P:1854.09 E:0.086462 |  so thank you
[8791.20 - 8793.20] P:1890.52 E:0.095779 |  Thank you
[8793.20 - 8795.20] P:1656.13 E:0.108292 |  So thank you very much to Mario Melchiot
[8795.20 - 8799.20] P:1610.27 E:0.108355 |  Ian Deniz and Chris Sutton are going to be taking you through this second period of extra time
[8799.20 - 8801.20] P:1579.10 E:0.103007 |  You do wonder a bit Chris
[8801.20 - 8803.20] P:1698.76 E:0.110642 |  why Holland with all the momentum
[8803.20 - 8805.20] P:1575.29 E:0.098972 |  from that late late equalizer
[8805.20 - 8809.20] P:1677.36 E:0.104347 |  didn't maybe ride that energy for a little while
[8809.20 - 8811.20] P:1779.45 E:0.101591 |  Yeah absolutely
[8811.20 - 8813.20] P:1841.75 E:0.113691 |  it was working for them
[8813.20 - 8815.20] P:1804.14 E:0.115206 |  you know it was brutal
[8815.20 - 8817.20] P:1836.12 E:0.106156 |  they were effective they got themselves back into the game
[8817.20 - 8819.20] P:1637.50 E:0.105189 |  playing group 1 football
[8819.20 - 8821.20] P:1724.67 E:0.112773 |  but they got level
[8821.20 - 8823.20] P:1850.21 E:0.113432 |  and now they
[8823.20 - 8825.20] P:1811.55 E:0.098116 |  they're just a little bit fearful
[8825.20 - 8827.20] P:1843.41 E:0.113226 |  in that first half of extra time
[8827.20 - 8831.20] P:1834.58 E:0.108109 |  I don't think any of the players really wanted to go to penalties
[8831.20 - 8835.20] P:1775.08 E:0.105681 |  but that's the way they both played in that first period of extra time
[8835.20 - 8839.20] P:1833.94 E:0.101115 |  I'd like to see them be braver

[8877.20 - 8879.20] P:1460.81 E:0.117570 |  and it's 2-2
[8879.20 - 8881.20] P:1552.37 E:0.119384 |  but they've taken the free kick too quickly
[8881.20 - 8883.20] P:1765.68 E:0.110162 |  and the bench are up in arms again

[8897.20 - 8899.20] P:1687.82 E:0.111829 |  runs it behind for a corner kick
[8899.20 - 8903.20] P:1589.34 E:0.107694 |  it was actually a dreadful pass from Messi
[8903.20 - 8907.20] P:1614.24 E:0.111154 |  that's a pot of all 15 yards into Montiel
[8907.20 - 8909.20] P:1645.29 E:0.106743 |  but too close to Gacpo
[8909.20 - 8911.20] P:1643.35 E:0.096469 |  Montiel slipped

[8961.20 - 8963.20] P:1731.52 E:0.094833 |  or do they hold on to what they've got
[8963.20 - 8965.20] P:1847.05 E:0.102679 |  and think they'll take it to penalties
[8965.20 - 8967.20] P:1755.29 E:0.109250 |  knowing that they've got a dreadful record

[8969.20 - 8971.20] P:1672.49 E:0.097755 |  that's the risk

[8975.20 - 8977.20] P:1674.39 E:0.112647 |  but if the Dutch
[8977.20 - 8979.20] P:1700.73 E:0.120557 |  end up losing on penalties
[8979.20 - 8981.20] P:1842.23 E:0.111977 |  they'll be saying well why didn't we play

[9003.20 - 9005.20] P:1845.00 E:0.104300 |  a lot of the supporters around us certainly did at 2-0
[9005.20 - 9007.20] P:1658.45 E:0.099440 |  but it's now 2-2
[9007.20 - 9009.20] P:1825.54 E:0.105895 |  just a third minute of extra time
[9009.20 - 9011.20] P:1542.42 E:0.074850 |  here in Luscia

[9017.20 - 9019.20] P:1525.41 E:0.106435 |  that he's the magic man
[9021.20 - 9023.20] P:1588.03 E:0.115462 |  who can make things happen for Argentina
[9023.20 - 9025.20] P:1799.11 E:0.107522 |  he's just hanging out on this right-hand side
[9027.20 - 9029.20] P:1343.85 E:0.097901 |  you can see Frankie de Jong
[9029.20 - 9031.20] P:1333.80 E:0.111158 |  his eyes all the time on him
[9033.20 - 9035.20] P:1646.45 E:0.113934 |  we've already seen the back of Neymar
[9035.20 - 9037.20] P:1772.23 E:0.116526 |  today
[9037.20 - 9039.20] P:1871.26 E:0.122088 |  a little bit of hesitation
[9039.20 - 9041.20] P:1861.25 E:0.115684 |  from Nopper
[9041.20 - 9043.20] P:1794.32 E:0.111513 |  he thought the ball would bounce into the penalty area
[9043.20 - 9045.20] P:1699.55 E:0.104720 |  and in the end he had to concede a throw
[9045.20 - 9047.20] P:1450.54 E:0.111362 |  up to safety first
[9049.20 - 9051.20] P:1720.70 E:0.122151 |  Al Cristiano Ronaldo fair tomorrow

[9055.20 - 9057.20] P:1801.48 E:0.111376 |  could this be Messi's final ever appearance
[9057.20 - 9059.20] P:1742.18 E:0.106605 |  at a World Cup
[9059.20 - 9061.20] P:1776.88 E:0.111148 |  as he's just been brought to ground
[9061.20 - 9063.20] P:1730.75 E:0.114300 |  and it's a free kick in a good position for Argentina
[9063.20 - 9065.20] P:1744.44 E:0.106247 |  just in from the right touch-line
[9065.20 - 9067.20] P:1576.08 E:0.105127 |  probably about 25 yards out
[9067.20 - 9069.20] P:1668.47 E:0.113859 |  somebody's spoken out a turn again down there
[9071.20 - 9073.20] P:1792.20 E:0.114612 |  and that was Gonzalo Montiel
[9073.20 - 9075.20] P:1762.12 E:0.112309 |  who's been showing yellow card
[9075.20 - 9077.20] P:1631.29 E:0.110562 |  and that now means
[9077.20 - 9079.20] P:1627.58 E:0.110083 |  that he is suspended
[9079.20 - 9081.20] P:1786.67 E:0.110049 |  he will miss the semi-final
[9081.20 - 9083.20] P:1694.68 E:0.104736 |  that's just foolish, just he sent
[9083.20 - 9085.20] P:1692.44 E:0.105001 |  so Montiel is showing yellow card
[9085.20 - 9087.20] P:1851.49 E:0.111424 |  he like a cunier will be suspended now
[9087.20 - 9089.20] P:1761.84 E:0.104822 |  should they go on to play Croatia
[9089.20 - 9091.20] P:1648.67 E:0.109850 |  he's only been on the field for a matter of minutes
[9091.20 - 9093.20] P:1562.01 E:0.101664 |  free kick
[9093.20 - 9095.20] P:1539.67 E:0.086038 |  Paredes touches it
[9095.20 - 9097.20] P:1731.52 E:0.100997 |  to Messi, runs forward

[9099.20 - 9101.20] P:1831.73 E:0.119538 |  onto his left foot, Messi no curl
[9101.20 - 9103.20] P:1964.58 E:0.105417 |  and it was always on the rise
[9103.20 - 9105.20] P:1819.23 E:0.110259 |  goal kick 2-2
[9105.20 - 9107.20] P:1710.96 E:0.099932 |  they played it short out on the right hand side
[9107.20 - 9109.20] P:1471.81 E:0.098910 |  and Messi driving in
[9109.20 - 9111.20] P:1253.03 E:0.113800 |  to the box on his left foot

[9117.20 - 9119.20] P:1487.96 E:0.114232 |  Messi decides to go inside
[9119.20 - 9121.20] P:1632.88 E:0.101438 |  on that wonderful left foot of his
[9121.20 - 9123.20] P:1772.95 E:0.105114 |  but high and wide with the effort
[9127.20 - 9129.20] P:1684.38 E:0.094272 |  so when Portugal played
[9129.20 - 9131.20] P:1590.72 E:0.095362 |  the Netherlands in Nuremberg
[9131.20 - 9133.20] P:1798.90 E:0.106665 |  in 2006 it was 9 yellow cards

[9145.20 - 9147.20] P:1825.63 E:0.117647 |  5 minutes played

[9149.20 - 9151.20] P:1730.39 E:0.110293 |  and the way that this Spanish referee
[9151.20 - 9153.20] P:1867.79 E:0.108241 |  is going
[9153.20 - 9155.20] P:1787.14 E:0.106740 |  we could easily have a few more
[9157.20 - 9159.20] P:1679.95 E:0.108307 |  he loves it doesn't he
[9159.20 - 9161.20] P:1600.69 E:0.104779 |  did say, did or not
[9161.20 - 9163.20] P:1703.86 E:0.097677 |  he did, yeah
[9165.20 - 9167.20] P:1801.84 E:0.111257 |  he's Di Maria
[9167.20 - 9169.20] P:1793.03 E:0.103608 |  coming on

[9173.20 - 9175.20] P:1783.31 E:0.114235 |  can he
[9175.20 - 9177.20] P:1775.37 E:0.118088 |  can he
[9177.20 - 9179.20] P:1778.98 E:0.110442 |  can he

[9197.20 - 9199.20] P:1707.65 E:0.104677 |  say with Louis Van Hal

[9233.20 - 9235.20] P:1769.70 E:0.100490 |  I thought
[9235.20 - 9237.20] P:1844.06 E:0.105080 |  it was a good challenge
[9237.20 - 9239.20] P:1797.98 E:0.099936 |  on gap boat, maybe he got
[9239.20 - 9241.20] P:1754.33 E:0.100178 |  gap boat for a long way back here
[9241.20 - 9243.20] P:1843.92 E:0.087876 |  before the ball

[9275.20 - 9277.20] P:1998.34 E:0.111396 |  Luc D'Yong has two bites at that
[9277.20 - 9279.20] P:1814.53 E:0.111103 |  and eventually it is cleared away
[9279.20 - 9281.20] P:1864.32 E:0.111228 |  the referee blows his whistle
[9281.20 - 9283.20] P:1775.05 E:0.090920 |  beautifully worked

[9285.20 - 9287.20] P:1767.95 E:0.119394 |  D'Yong all the way around the back
[9287.20 - 9289.20] P:1640.87 E:0.093086 |  as the ball floated

[9295.20 - 9297.20] P:1525.80 E:0.101108 |  so Fernandez gets the block on it
[9297.20 - 9299.20] P:1827.92 E:0.099400 |  D'Yong follows through
[9299.20 - 9301.20] P:1829.65 E:0.097035 |  to either foul

[9309.20 - 9311.20] P:1603.30 E:0.118386 |  of course has already made his impact

[9313.20 - 9315.20] P:1769.56 E:0.105646 |  striker to do exactly that
[9315.20 - 9317.20] P:1165.86 E:0.096117 |  and it's
[9317.20 - 9319.20] P:1406.78 E:0.110933 |  Noah Lang
[9319.20 - 9321.20] P:1605.51 E:0.113356 |  who plays for Bruges

[9327.20 - 9329.20] P:1802.77 E:0.101732 |  he might see him
[9329.20 - 9331.20] P:1744.82 E:0.100719 |  in the Premier League
[9331.20 - 9333.20] P:1804.43 E:0.098845 |  in the not too distant future

[9359.20 - 9361.20] P:1719.90 E:0.113012 |  the clearance isn't properly away
[9361.20 - 9363.20] P:1728.81 E:0.101728 |  by the Netherlands
[9363.20 - 9365.20] P:1721.12 E:0.091082 |  De Maria picks it up
[9365.20 - 9367.20] P:1723.58 E:0.118139 |  Fernandez comes forward
[9367.20 - 9369.20] P:1967.57 E:0.112872 |  by Hansaid
[9369.20 - 9371.20] P:1818.34 E:0.114916 |  all that took a wicked defection
[9371.20 - 9373.20] P:1819.62 E:0.112875 |  what a blow that was
[9373.20 - 9375.20] P:1965.32 E:0.113854 |  Loctano Martinez with a right footed shot
[9375.20 - 9377.20] P:1712.17 E:0.101330 |  it looked goal bound
[9377.20 - 9379.20] P:1840.10 E:0.111746 |  and it calmed away
[9379.20 - 9381.20] P:1908.41 E:0.108399 |  and it's gone behind for a corner kick
[9381.20 - 9383.20] P:1682.70 E:0.111864 |  and it was off the chest of Van Dijk
[9383.20 - 9385.20] P:1712.30 E:0.105906 |  yes it was brilliant from Fernandez
[9385.20 - 9387.20] P:1673.93 E:0.111637 |  little jink down that right hand side
[9387.20 - 9389.20] P:1831.35 E:0.113240 |  works himself a yard
[9389.20 - 9391.20] P:1768.42 E:0.115275 |  fizzes the ball across Martinez
[9391.20 - 9393.20] P:1853.18 E:0.114709 |  hammers the ball

[9399.20 - 9401.20] P:2021.49 E:0.116156 |  they wanted a VAR check
[9401.20 - 9403.20] P:1963.52 E:0.102644 |  it has been taken in towards the near post
[9403.20 - 9405.20] P:1885.12 E:0.106921 |  Coop miners with the first one into the air
[9405.20 - 9407.20] P:1994.13 E:0.111501 |  and then volled away by Van Dijk

[9409.20 - 9411.20] P:1645.80 E:0.080699 |  otherwise

[9419.20 - 9421.20] P:1792.00 E:0.105553 |  Montiel will win a corner kick
[9421.20 - 9423.20] P:1948.33 E:0.122780 |  getting forward at every opportunity
[9423.20 - 9425.20] P:1884.60 E:0.112134 |  from right back
[9425.20 - 9427.20] P:1854.18 E:0.120900 |  they're jumping up and down behind that goal
[9427.20 - 9429.20] P:1941.79 E:0.116740 |  there's urgency now for Argentina
[9429.20 - 9431.20] P:1613.83 E:0.109254 |  Roll short

[9435.20 - 9437.20] P:2012.84 E:0.118458 |  actually Fletcher loops over the crossbar
[9437.20 - 9439.20] P:1900.09 E:0.117879 |  and for a corner kick he goes
[9439.20 - 9441.20] P:1847.14 E:0.111357 |  that could have gone anywhere
[9441.20 - 9443.20] P:1869.14 E:0.106588 |  it was off Beckhorst I think
[9443.20 - 9445.20] P:1919.52 E:0.109159 |  and the keeper was already going to ground
[9445.20 - 9447.20] P:1778.67 E:0.113444 |  it was agonising
[9447.20 - 9449.20] P:1633.67 E:0.101580 |  absolutely spot on
[9449.20 - 9451.20] P:1728.05 E:0.122403 |  Noppert has gone down
[9451.20 - 9453.20] P:1766.83 E:0.103770 |  Nessie just feeds the ball to Fernandez
[9453.20 - 9455.20] P:1849.57 E:0.114577 |  let's the ball run across his body
[9455.20 - 9457.20] P:1706.47 E:0.109144 |  left footed
[9457.20 - 9459.20] P:1544.63 E:0.095099 |  Hammer's a shot
[9459.20 - 9461.20] P:1731.91 E:0.111096 |  takes the deflection into the floor
[9461.20 - 9463.20] P:1726.55 E:0.112951 |  Noppert had gone but agonising me over the bar
[9463.20 - 9465.20] P:1759.90 E:0.104847 |  for Argentina
[9465.20 - 9467.20] P:1687.34 E:0.091087 |  Argentina now looking
[9467.20 - 9469.20] P:1771.29 E:0.100064 |  for another their turn to try and get a
[9469.20 - 9471.20] P:1771.27 E:0.093132 |  knockout blow
[9471.20 - 9473.20] P:1722.01 E:0.101704 |  after they bounce pocket back off the canvas
[9473.20 - 9475.20] P:1807.76 E:0.104160 |  from that late Dutch goal
[9475.20 - 9477.20] P:1940.77 E:0.113338 |  that forces into extra time
[9477.20 - 9479.20] P:1979.72 E:0.114788 |  because now the Dutch are being forced back
[9479.20 - 9481.20] P:1946.83 E:0.112607 |  cross comes in from the left behind
[9481.20 - 9483.20] P:1757.60 E:0.104357 |  for another corner kick

[9495.20 - 9497.20] P:1660.06 E:0.106082 |  and the header
[9497.20 - 9499.20] P:1735.02 E:0.095397 |  from the defender
[9499.20 - 9501.20] P:1781.16 E:0.105824 |  which was Pacella
[9501.20 - 9503.20] P:1607.20 E:0.085352 |  was over the top
[9503.20 - 9505.20] P:1862.91 E:0.104873 |  and it's a goal kick
[9505.20 - 9507.20] P:1903.89 E:0.095707 |  to the Dutch and another minute he's been a tick by
[9507.20 - 9509.20] P:1691.24 E:0.104535 |  Christian
[9509.20 - 9511.20] P:1613.67 E:0.099651 |  yes poor defending from Virgil van Dijk

[9525.20 - 9527.20] P:1784.95 E:0.108931 |  for the Dutch against Costa Rica
[9527.20 - 9529.20] P:1624.73 E:0.108662 |  was their only win

[9547.20 - 9549.20] P:1857.87 E:0.115365 |  and they could be set for another one here on 5 live

[9555.20 - 9557.20] P:1939.64 E:0.114631 |  forward ball towards Lutley on

[9565.20 - 9567.20] P:1931.19 E:0.105436 |  with a cross from the left
[9567.20 - 9569.20] P:1926.20 E:0.118477 |  and it was Burpus who was making the run
[9569.20 - 9571.20] P:2050.04 E:0.108852 |  through the middle but that was assured handling
[9571.20 - 9573.20] P:1712.32 E:0.082335 |  by Emi Martinez
[9573.20 - 9575.20] P:1481.81 E:0.119344 |  I'm going to slightly disagree
[9575.20 - 9577.20] P:1691.89 E:0.093351 |  with you about assured handling
[9577.20 - 9579.20] P:1717.61 E:0.089410 |  he dropped it
[9579.20 - 9581.20] P:1714.86 E:0.104196 |  it was a good decision to come
[9581.20 - 9583.20] P:1763.46 E:0.096889 |  and try and claim it
[9583.20 - 9585.20] P:1779.61 E:0.110511 |  but a bit lucky there
[9587.20 - 9589.20] P:1727.90 E:0.124525 |  maybe your definition
[9589.20 - 9591.20] P:1691.86 E:0.099387 |  of assured is different to most people
[9591.20 - 9593.20] P:1855.94 E:0.098773 |  I've had a nightmare

[9737.20 - 9739.20] P:1656.07 E:0.097742 |  on his goal line

[9743.20 - 9745.20] P:1682.81 E:0.098373 |  De Maria but that big Dutch hand

[9805.20 - 9807.20] P:1969.64 E:0.118564 |  and if you thought
[9807.20 - 9809.20] P:1977.25 E:0.121195 |  the last I'm going to say two hours
[9809.20 - 9811.20] P:1973.67 E:0.108863 |  but it was two hours and 11 minutes
[9811.20 - 9813.20] P:1936.71 E:0.109734 |  have been nerve wracking
[9813.20 - 9815.20] P:1847.09 E:0.110912 |  and filled with tension and drama
[9815.20 - 9817.20] P:1765.64 E:0.110540 |  we've got a penalty shoot out now
[9817.20 - 9819.20] P:1657.25 E:0.098455 |  to prepare here in Lusail

[9825.20 - 9827.20] P:1208.92 E:0.096964 |  from the Lusail stadium
[9827.20 - 9829.20] P:1267.96 E:0.112337 |  where the atmosphere feels like an elastic
[9829.20 - 9831.20] P:1346.75 E:0.104089 |  band that is getting pulled tighter
[9831.20 - 9833.20] P:1484.62 E:0.104790 |  and tighter and any
[9833.20 - 9835.20] P:1474.50 E:0.105092 |  second the penalties are going to come
[9835.20 - 9837.20] P:1528.28 E:0.104178 |  and it is going to snap
[9837.20 - 9839.20] P:1403.33 E:0.106259 |  Tim Vickery our South American football
[9839.20 - 9841.20] P:1857.74 E:0.079491 |  expert is with us
[9841.20 - 9843.20] P:1764.42 E:0.108173 |  Tim there were chances for Argentina
[9843.20 - 9845.20] P:1665.18 E:0.105096 |  at the end they came so close
[9845.20 - 9847.20] P:1738.64 E:0.096087 |  to wrapping that up inside the
[9847.20 - 9849.20] P:1428.11 E:0.087110 |  120 minutes
[9849.20 - 9851.20] P:1506.72 E:0.094107 |  but there's going to penalties
[9851.20 - 9853.20] P:1772.00 E:0.098993 |  it's a scandal really isn't it
[9853.20 - 9855.20] P:1573.19 E:0.109093 |  but it's one of the lessons that we've seen
[9855.20 - 9857.20] P:1669.30 E:0.089375 |  from this World Cup
[9857.20 - 9859.20] P:1700.48 E:0.097502 |  pattern of the game Schmatton
[9859.20 - 9861.20] P:1691.93 E:0.106845 |  you can win it in little
[9861.20 - 9863.20] P:1809.17 E:0.108405 |  hang in there in little bursts
[9863.20 - 9865.20] P:1721.60 E:0.108302 |  how did Japan beat
[9865.20 - 9867.20] P:1759.83 E:0.097073 |  Spain and Germany
[9867.20 - 9869.20] P:1755.29 E:0.113590 |  little bursts five minutes here
[9869.20 - 9871.20] P:1852.33 E:0.100300 |  ten minutes there and Holland
[9871.20 - 9873.20] P:1713.09 E:0.109417 |  have done it saving themselves with a kind of
[9873.20 - 9875.20] P:1806.28 E:0.095665 |  15 minute burst
[9875.20 - 9877.20] P:1736.51 E:0.117133 |  against Argentina didn't do a great deal
[9877.20 - 9879.20] P:1679.76 E:0.111949 |  else for the rest of this marathon encounter
[9879.20 - 9881.20] P:1770.53 E:0.105254 |  but they did enough in that
[9881.20 - 9883.20] P:1797.91 E:0.111008 |  little burst to be hanging in there
[9883.20 - 9885.20] P:1642.22 E:0.095150 |  and taking this game to penalties
[9887.20 - 9889.20] P:1616.92 E:0.111693 |  Do you think that the Netherlands approach this
[9889.20 - 9891.20] P:1710.73 E:0.097540 |  thinking penalties are our best way
[9891.20 - 9893.20] P:1655.44 E:0.082378 |  of progressing to the next round
[9893.20 - 9895.20] P:1458.14 E:0.101685 |  even if it was just something at the back of the heads
[9895.20 - 9897.20] P:1625.56 E:0.086843 |  I don't think so from the start
[9897.20 - 9899.20] P:1541.40 E:0.106205 |  but remember how they
[9899.20 - 9901.20] P:1303.74 E:0.090031 |  beat the states and how important
[9901.20 - 9903.20] P:1434.85 E:0.103452 |  the right wing back
[9903.20 - 9905.20] P:1620.25 E:0.095225 |  Dumfries was for that performance
[9905.20 - 9907.20] P:1884.60 E:0.111569 |  and Argentina changed their
[9907.20 - 9909.20] P:1462.62 E:0.108413 |  formation and they came up with a system
[9909.20 - 9911.20] P:1478.49 E:0.080275 |  that neutralised him
[9911.20 - 9913.20] P:1498.26 E:0.114306 |  and they ended up making him do
[9913.20 - 9915.20] P:1591.54 E:0.107422 |  what he doesn't want to do so much which is defend
[9915.20 - 9917.20] P:1637.96 E:0.109438 |  and he gave away a rather soft penalty
[9917.20 - 9919.20] P:1483.86 E:0.097945 |  but then Argentina went 2-0 up
[9919.20 - 9921.20] P:1504.88 E:0.088615 |  and you thought
[9921.20 - 9923.20] P:1481.40 E:0.103875 |  then that it was all over
[9923.20 - 9925.20] P:1723.14 E:0.076757 |  once the Dutch had hauled
[9925.20 - 9927.20] P:1465.87 E:0.099686 |  their way back into the game
[9927.20 - 9929.20] P:1492.56 E:0.108416 |  you sent there an extra time
[9929.20 - 9931.20] P:1347.87 E:0.094773 |  that they knew
[9931.20 - 9933.20] P:1577.23 E:0.111272 |  that they may perhaps just get
[9933.20 - 9935.20] P:1449.68 E:0.109985 |  something on the break but from that point
[9935.20 - 9937.20] P:1628.72 E:0.109752 |  the main task was hanging on
[9937.20 - 9939.20] P:1671.85 E:0.100660 |  for the penalty shootout
[9939.20 - 9941.20] P:1658.18 E:0.096596 |  which of course they lost
[9941.20 - 9943.20] P:1639.12 E:0.109060 |  in the semi-final against Argentina
[9943.20 - 9945.20] P:1707.52 E:0.105911 |  8 years ago
[9945.20 - 9947.20] P:1630.05 E:0.098440 |  maybe they'll have a little bit better luck this time
[9947.20 - 9949.20] P:1630.29 E:0.115085 |  that wonderful free kick goal
[9949.20 - 9951.20] P:1854.86 E:0.089725 |  though from the Dutch
[9951.20 - 9953.20] P:1608.89 E:0.139859 |  it does remind you of the one that Argentina
[9953.20 - 9955.20] P:1618.16 E:0.112824 |  worked against England in 98
[9955.20 - 9957.20] P:1750.41 E:0.110508 |  do you remember that goal Kelly
[9957.20 - 9959.20] P:1758.16 E:0.117317 |  free kick on the edge of the area
[9959.20 - 9961.20] P:1428.57 E:0.121907 |  a cute one to the edge of the wall
[9961.20 - 9963.20] P:1644.25 E:0.107138 |  and Zanetti bangs it in
[9963.20 - 9965.20] P:1740.70 E:0.111793 |  on the turn
[9965.20 - 9967.20] P:1504.66 E:0.107745 |  the Holland one was similarly cute
[9967.20 - 9969.20] P:1502.08 E:0.103370 |  and even more important because it was then or never
[9969.20 - 9971.20] P:1583.59 E:0.116199 |  that game went to penalties
[9971.20 - 9973.20] P:1472.86 E:0.093809 |  Argentina came through that one
[9973.20 - 9975.20] P:1564.35 E:0.097559 |  let's see what happens now
[9975.20 - 9977.20] P:1372.68 E:0.093855 |  Tim Vickery for now thank you very much
[9977.20 - 9979.20] P:1217.47 E:0.102754 |  both sets of players now making their way
[9979.20 - 9981.20] P:1458.01 E:0.099761 |  over to the centre circle
[9981.20 - 9983.20] P:1561.46 E:0.094217 |  Argentina have been ready to go for quite a while
[9983.20 - 9985.20] P:1392.04 E:0.097493 |  Netherlands just been huddled up
[9985.20 - 9987.20] P:1624.11 E:0.105299 |  a bit longer with their substitutes
[9987.20 - 9989.20] P:1602.26 E:0.117103 |  with their manager Louis van Haal
[9989.20 - 9991.20] P:1743.28 E:0.094218 |  they're in the centre circle
[9991.20 - 9993.20] P:1732.02 E:0.106459 |  the captains are tossing the coin
[9993.20 - 9995.20] P:1628.86 E:0.099191 |  to make sure that they know which end
[9995.20 - 9997.20] P:1448.93 E:0.098766 |  they're going to go
[9997.20 - 9999.20] P:1435.96 E:0.101245 |  which end they're going to take the penalties at
[9999.20 - 10001.20] P:1393.54 E:0.104042 |  and which side is going to go first
[10001.20 - 10003.20] P:1500.73 E:0.092488 |  it doesn't really matter for Argentina
[10003.20 - 10005.20] P:1292.20 E:0.098388 |  which side they take the penalties at
[10005.20 - 10007.20] P:1679.55 E:0.092298 |  their supporters are well represented
[10007.20 - 10009.20] P:1469.70 E:0.101243 |  all the way around this stadium
[10009.20 - 10011.20] P:1653.82 E:0.089626 |  but there is a little pocket
[10011.20 - 10013.20] P:1549.60 E:0.100631 |  and maybe at most a couple of hundred
[10013.20 - 10015.20] P:1674.78 E:0.103854 |  to the right of the goal over to our left
[10015.20 - 10017.20] P:1698.10 E:0.104522 |  so presumably
[10017.20 - 10019.20] P:1642.42 E:0.104382 |  that's where they would prefer to go
[10019.20 - 10021.20] P:1634.92 E:0.109614 |  and it looks like that's where Virgil van Dijk
[10021.20 - 10023.20] P:1811.60 E:0.095769 |  is taking the ball
[10023.20 - 10025.20] P:1762.28 E:0.096265 |  to take the first penalty of this
[10025.20 - 10027.20] P:1676.53 E:0.100167 |  shootout for a place in the
[10027.20 - 10029.20] P:1715.86 E:0.103502 |  semi-finals of this World Cup
[10029.20 - 10031.20] P:1673.46 E:0.102251 |  it's Netherlands against Argentina
[10031.20 - 10033.20] P:1742.46 E:0.103214 |  2-2 after 120 minutes
[10033.20 - 10035.20] P:1679.64 E:0.102236 |  for Sutton and Ian Dennis
[10035.20 - 10037.20] P:1914.16 E:0.090088 |  thank you Kelly
[10037.20 - 10039.20] P:1779.89 E:0.095309 |  well earlier today
[10039.20 - 10041.20] P:1788.43 E:0.091439 |  when Brazil went out on penalties
[10041.20 - 10043.20] P:1916.79 E:0.105349 |  that was the first time in
[10043.20 - 10045.20] P:1962.07 E:0.100921 |  eight World Cup shootouts
[10045.20 - 10047.20] P:1841.15 E:0.088711 |  at the side that went second
[10047.20 - 10049.20] P:1881.05 E:0.094129 |  actually lost
[10049.20 - 10051.20] P:2003.40 E:0.114124 |  and now it's van Dijk up against
[10051.20 - 10053.20] P:1995.53 E:0.106772 |  Emi Martinez
[10053.20 - 10055.20] P:2067.78 E:0.112336 |  who saved three penalties
[10055.20 - 10057.20] P:2074.37 E:0.110726 |  against Colombia
[10057.20 - 10059.20] P:2047.48 E:0.122393 |  in the Copa America semi-final
[10059.20 - 10061.20] P:2081.36 E:0.120911 |  we're looking away
[10061.20 - 10063.20] P:2126.22 E:0.115036 |  towards our left hand side
[10065.20 - 10067.20] P:2121.25 E:0.115241 |  van Dijk short run up
[10067.20 - 10069.20] P:2114.55 E:0.118891 |  against Emi Martinez all in red
[10069.20 - 10071.20] P:2061.80 E:0.104583 |  van Dijk
[10071.20 - 10073.20] P:2064.51 E:0.118849 |  to the Netherlands
[10073.20 - 10075.20] P:2063.00 E:0.121724 |  saved by Martinez
[10075.20 - 10077.20] P:2036.39 E:0.118881 |  he's done it again
[10077.20 - 10079.20] P:2063.36 E:0.119594 |  more heroics
[10079.20 - 10081.20] P:2010.53 E:0.118223 |  and the Juts have not made a very good start
[10083.20 - 10085.20] P:1826.17 E:0.119586 |  gotta say this is a magnificent save
[10085.20 - 10087.20] P:1946.91 E:0.111081 |  two steps
[10087.20 - 10089.20] P:1868.02 E:0.110241 |  van Dijk gets
[10089.20 - 10091.20] P:1873.45 E:0.117978 |  good pace on the ball
[10091.20 - 10093.20] P:1902.36 E:0.118477 |  whips it across Martinez
[10093.20 - 10095.20] P:1907.40 E:0.114179 |  you can say it's a good hide
[10095.20 - 10097.20] P:1837.80 E:0.105814 |  but flies
[10097.20 - 10099.20] P:1772.58 E:0.114327 |  and blinks himself
[10099.20 - 10101.20] P:1789.06 E:0.106501 |  to his right hand side
[10101.20 - 10103.20] P:1940.11 E:0.119259 |  Franky De Jong sang
[10103.20 - 10105.20] P:1714.05 E:0.112290 |  the goalkeeper's gone early there
[10105.20 - 10107.20] P:1727.67 E:0.101562 |  the Argentinian players now
[10107.20 - 10109.20] P:1735.82 E:0.090888 |  ushering

[10111.20 - 10113.20] P:1824.77 E:0.110446 |  I think he
[10113.20 - 10115.20] P:1783.95 E:0.098777 |  my gut instinct there was
[10115.20 - 10117.20] P:1773.98 E:0.114706 |  he's said again
[10117.20 - 10119.20] P:1712.59 E:0.093140 |  he may have gone early there
[10119.20 - 10121.20] P:1731.19 E:0.102201 |  good to see that again
[10121.20 - 10123.20] P:1820.72 E:0.097083 |  Messi now
[10123.20 - 10125.20] P:1803.67 E:0.106122 |  steps forward
[10125.20 - 10127.20] P:1828.85 E:0.106761 |  to get it himself on the board
[10127.20 - 10129.20] P:2012.27 E:0.111354 |  he's fluctuating fortunes from the spot
[10129.20 - 10131.20] P:2012.25 E:0.118516 |  so far at this World Cup
[10131.20 - 10133.20] P:2026.33 E:0.117360 |  oh how cool is that
[10133.20 - 10135.20] P:1981.51 E:0.112370 |  oh how cool is that
[10135.20 - 10137.20] P:2028.72 E:0.126502 |  he just rolled it
[10137.20 - 10139.20] P:1983.71 E:0.114085 |  left footed
[10139.20 - 10141.20] P:2004.62 E:0.111823 |  not put a dime to his left
[10141.20 - 10143.20] P:1880.33 E:0.120285 |  and then he stood there
[10143.20 - 10145.20] P:1896.58 E:0.107027 |  you've referred to him as
[10145.20 - 10147.20] P:1925.15 E:0.114183 |  like God
[10147.20 - 10149.20] P:1843.13 E:0.108506 |  he just took it in arms out wide
[10149.20 - 10151.20] P:1829.40 E:0.111546 |  that was brilliant
[10151.20 - 10153.20] P:1881.80 E:0.110624 |  it was the penalty he scored in
[10153.20 - 10155.20] P:1905.08 E:0.115934 |  real time
[10155.20 - 10157.20] P:1973.72 E:0.111811 |  whipped across Nopper

[10167.20 - 10169.20] P:2095.08 E:0.118843 |  sorry it's one 0 to Argentina in the shoot
[10169.20 - 10171.20] P:2103.30 E:0.121866 |  this is Steven Berkus

[10173.20 - 10175.20] P:2086.26 E:0.118421 |  goes for power

[10177.20 - 10179.20] P:2049.02 E:0.124726 |  and Martinez

[10325.20 - 10327.20] P:1985.94 E:0.113570 |  placed it perfect

[10387.20 - 10389.20] P:1714.26 E:0.095030 |  Dmeria
[10389.20 - 10391.20] P:1831.65 E:0.083925 |  but he wrapped his foot around that

[10407.20 - 10409.20] P:1950.92 E:0.117099 |  it would be the same score line in the penalty shootout

[10411.20 - 10413.20] P:1928.06 E:0.096621 |  if Enzo Fernandez
[10413.20 - 10415.20] P:1918.18 E:0.096096 |  who hit the post right at the end
[10415.20 - 10417.20] P:1751.39 E:0.072077 |  can score here for Argentina

[10433.20 - 10435.20] P:1927.93 E:0.104698 |  advantage Argentina
[10435.20 - 10437.20] P:1916.24 E:0.083204 |  three to
[10437.20 - 10439.20] P:1742.38 E:0.108964 |  I don't think I could take much more of this

[10453.20 - 10455.20] P:2062.06 E:0.105939 |  Luke De Jong

[10457.20 - 10459.20] P:2057.80 E:0.121390 |  so experienced
[10461.20 - 10463.20] P:2120.07 E:0.106591 |  pass to score
[10463.20 - 10465.20] P:2093.71 E:0.106334 |  for the Netherlands

[10469.20 - 10471.20] P:2060.88 E:0.118089 |  and Martínez moved to his left
[10471.20 - 10473.20] P:2038.92 E:0.108493 |  and De Jong rolled it in the other way
[10473.20 - 10475.20] P:1927.81 E:0.088931 |  and that's their third penalty
[10475.20 - 10477.20] P:2081.18 E:0.095750 |  that they've scored out of their five
[10477.20 - 10479.20] P:2065.37 E:0.112001 |  and now all of us are, oh look at this
[10479.20 - 10481.20] P:1890.80 E:0.079650 |  Lattaro Martínez steps forward
[10481.20 - 10483.20] P:2104.77 E:0.099207 |  and he's faced by four
[10483.20 - 10485.20] P:2112.11 E:0.096854 |  Dutch players who break away
[10485.20 - 10487.20] P:2111.45 E:0.107711 |  from the centre circle
[10487.20 - 10489.20] P:1925.40 E:0.090599 |  to try and put him under some pressure
[10489.20 - 10491.20] P:1979.80 E:0.100624 |  with the verbals
[10491.20 - 10493.20] P:2005.39 E:0.091903 |  and the card has been shown
[10493.20 - 10495.20] P:1825.46 E:0.076734 |  of course it has to
[10497.20 - 10499.20] P:1800.24 E:0.100765 |  the big balls from Luke De Jong there
[10499.20 - 10501.20] P:1718.73 E:0.089836 |  sits Martínez down
[10503.20 - 10505.20] P:1687.20 E:0.110595 |  but the pressure on this penalty
[10505.20 - 10507.20] P:1727.18 E:0.090174 |  Ian
[10507.20 - 10509.20] P:1624.80 E:0.103859 |  I don't think I can watch
[10509.20 - 10511.20] P:1778.45 E:0.087585 |  and now you've got
[10511.20 - 10513.20] P:1773.02 E:0.096820 |  a little bit of gamesmanship here
[10513.20 - 10515.20] P:1809.85 E:0.098506 |  from Andreas Nopper
[10515.20 - 10517.20] P:1866.70 E:0.097971 |  who's come up his goal line
[10517.20 - 10519.20] P:1908.66 E:0.105376 |  and had a word there with Lattaro Martínez
[10519.20 - 10521.20] P:1716.40 E:0.070086 |  seven goals
[10521.20 - 10523.20] P:1843.68 E:0.094119 |  in qualifying
[10523.20 - 10525.20] P:1864.75 E:0.089761 |  if he scores this
[10525.20 - 10527.20] P:1963.06 E:0.083993 |  Argentina withdrew
[10527.20 - 10529.20] P:1863.33 E:0.083884 |  Lattaro Martínez
[10529.20 - 10531.20] P:2127.99 E:0.106011 |  just scored
[10531.20 - 10533.20] P:2090.39 E:0.121826 |  the keeper went to his left
[10533.20 - 10535.20] P:2022.47 E:0.113522 |  Argentina celebrate
[10535.20 - 10537.20] P:2039.01 E:0.110525 |  the dreadful record
[10537.20 - 10539.20] P:2066.30 E:0.115459 |  for the Dutch continues
[10539.20 - 10541.20] P:1977.85 E:0.109676 |  and Argentina
[10541.20 - 10543.20] P:2059.57 E:0.117756 |  just like in 2014
[10543.20 - 10545.20] P:1925.12 E:0.111444 |  triumph on penalties
[10545.20 - 10547.20] P:1976.87 E:0.115220 |  and they will play Croatia
[10547.20 - 10549.20] P:1956.99 E:0.108940 |  in Tuesday's semi-finals
[10549.20 - 10551.20] P:1960.65 E:0.105675 |  but the bad blood continues
[10551.20 - 10553.20] P:1958.44 E:0.111975 |  between the two nations
[10553.20 - 10555.20] P:1926.13 E:0.111112 |  oh as it all
[10555.20 - 10557.20] P:1948.02 E:0.113115 |  is kicking off once again down below
[10557.20 - 10559.20] P:1913.63 E:0.095588 |  from those Dutch players
[10559.20 - 10561.20] P:1945.70 E:0.106666 |  and now we've got a fight
[10563.20 - 10565.20] P:1925.63 E:0.115845 |  and once again the referee
[10565.20 - 10567.20] P:1957.97 E:0.088167 |  and his assistants
[10567.20 - 10569.20] P:1841.43 E:0.093545 |  and the coaching staff
[10569.20 - 10571.20] P:1990.79 E:0.111341 |  have got to try and sort out the squabbles
[10571.20 - 10573.20] P:1987.30 E:0.107912 |  for those who are either not shell-shocked
[10573.20 - 10575.20] P:1959.03 E:0.101350 |  and have dropped to their knees in orange
[10575.20 - 10577.20] P:1917.61 E:0.102378 |  in the centre-circle
[10577.20 - 10579.20] P:1939.63 E:0.105857 |  or those who have formed a huddle
[10579.20 - 10581.20] P:1931.14 E:0.093363 |  in the blue and white
[10581.20 - 10583.20] P:1932.80 E:0.092322 |  and what has been a fratious
[10583.20 - 10585.20] P:1936.45 E:0.100070 |  night on Five Live
[10585.20 - 10587.20] P:1818.72 E:0.081629 |  but it's Argentina
[10587.20 - 10589.20] P:1888.27 E:0.106847 |  and expect the exodus from Argentina
[10589.20 - 10591.20] P:1935.57 E:0.101074 |  to continue
[10591.20 - 10593.20] P:1848.57 E:0.105822 |  there's 50,000 now
[10593.20 - 10595.20] P:1840.70 E:0.082413 |  there could be a few more on their way
[10595.20 - 10597.20] P:1810.84 E:0.110828 |  what a night Kelly
[10597.20 - 10599.20] P:1710.20 E:0.104197 |  and for those tens of thousands of Argentina fans
[10599.20 - 10601.20] P:1812.35 E:0.105956 |  who have made this world cup
[10601.20 - 10603.20] P:1749.40 E:0.109304 |  every single game that Argentina have played in
[10603.20 - 10605.20] P:1750.99 E:0.107648 |  such a joy to be a part of
[10605.20 - 10607.20] P:1782.18 E:0.103299 |  you have to feel delighted for them
[10607.20 - 10609.20] P:1571.31 E:0.110852 |  they're waving their shirts above their heads
[10609.20 - 10611.20] P:1713.91 E:0.097734 |  in the crowd
[10611.20 - 10613.20] P:1820.98 E:0.109310 |  it is a sea of sky blue
[10613.20 - 10615.20] P:1788.70 E:0.104687 |  and white as they celebrate
[10615.20 - 10617.20] P:1942.13 E:0.099084 |  with the Dutch players
[10617.20 - 10619.20] P:1856.00 E:0.115076 |  devastated on the pitch in front of us
[10619.20 - 10621.20] P:1651.55 E:0.112428 |  Argentina still in a huddle
[10621.20 - 10623.20] P:1728.10 E:0.095625 |  still gathered around them each other
[10623.20 - 10625.20] P:1875.97 E:0.097014 |  the whole bench
[10625.20 - 10627.20] P:1580.14 E:0.102762 |  the whole backroom staff are out on the pitch
[10627.20 - 10629.20] P:1731.95 E:0.100424 |  they're all embracing
[10629.20 - 10631.20] P:1709.96 E:0.103935 |  and Chris Sutton we will try and analyse this
[10631.20 - 10633.20] P:1690.50 E:0.093599 |  at some stage
[10633.20 - 10635.20] P:1617.03 E:0.101197 |  but some games are just
[10635.20 - 10637.20] P:1602.18 E:0.105953 |  all about the emotion
[10637.20 - 10639.20] P:1730.49 E:0.097052 |  there isn't any real
[10639.20 - 10641.20] P:1532.53 E:0.102449 |  sensible explanation as to what we've just seen
[10641.20 - 10643.20] P:1670.67 E:0.098326 |  over 120
[10643.20 - 10645.20] P:1643.21 E:0.099939 |  plus whatever minutes
[10645.20 - 10647.20] P:1749.19 E:0.086011 |  and the penalties
[10647.20 - 10649.20] P:1746.60 E:0.104119 |  it was just
[10649.20 - 10651.20] P:1745.79 E:0.108540 |  mental it was bonkers the game was
[10651.20 - 10653.20] P:1760.67 E:0.097131 |  how the Dutch got
[10653.20 - 10655.20] P:1844.41 E:0.110930 |  back into it with a brutal
[10655.20 - 10657.20] P:1758.05 E:0.091870 |  brand of football and effective
[10657.20 - 10659.20] P:1852.19 E:0.099795 |  brand of football then it goes into
[10659.20 - 10661.20] P:1864.14 E:0.104570 |  the extra time and the Dutch have got themselves
[10661.20 - 10663.20] P:1773.25 E:0.104672 |  back into the game by being
[10663.20 - 10665.20] P:1811.37 E:0.095447 |  really direct
[10665.20 - 10667.20] P:1663.44 E:0.099137 |  stop being direct and possibly
[10667.20 - 10669.20] P:1826.56 E:0.111108 |  played for penalties I can't believe they were actually
[10669.20 - 10671.20] P:1744.88 E:0.095120 |  thinking that playing the extra time
[10671.20 - 10673.20] P:1702.64 E:0.087870 |  but
[10673.20 - 10675.20] P:1761.65 E:0.105210 |  they actually stopped playing that way
[10675.20 - 10677.20] P:1782.90 E:0.104405 |  I didn't understand that then Argentina hit the post
[10677.20 - 10679.20] P:1833.86 E:0.107814 |  in the last seconds
[10679.20 - 10681.20] P:1766.83 E:0.094663 |  Fernandez with a ferocious strike
[10681.20 - 10683.20] P:1881.80 E:0.106197 |  is it going to be their night
[10683.20 - 10685.20] P:1820.00 E:0.099156 |  or is it going to be another South American side
[10685.20 - 10687.20] P:1747.52 E:0.093290 |  out of the competition
[10687.20 - 10689.20] P:1754.55 E:0.093647 |  after Brazil but
[10689.20 - 10691.20] P:1778.19 E:0.088899 |  I mean the penalties
[10691.20 - 10693.20] P:1883.21 E:0.112252 |  Argentina were up and then it looked like
[10693.20 - 10695.20] P:1790.00 E:0.097665 |  the Dutch had gotten themselves back in it but
[10695.20 - 10697.20] P:1686.97 E:0.097495 |  Lossero
[10697.20 - 10699.20] P:1864.42 E:0.103173 |  Martínez is penalty the last one
[10699.20 - 10701.20] P:1848.04 E:0.075878 |  what
[10701.20 - 10703.20] P:1878.77 E:0.105485 |  what nerves of steel what composure
[10703.20 - 10705.20] P:1587.11 E:0.097618 |  when the pressure
[10705.20 - 10707.20] P:1787.83 E:0.102961 |  was really on
[10707.20 - 10709.20] P:1814.79 E:0.114221 |  I'm delighted Argentina are through
[10709.20 - 10711.20] P:1876.41 E:0.102442 |  for their fans I mean
[10711.20 - 10713.20] P:1600.54 E:0.103303 |  I absolutely am they have
[10713.20 - 10715.20] P:1803.50 E:0.111538 |  in many ways made this
[10715.20 - 10717.20] P:1878.60 E:0.110872 |  world cup they've brought so much
[10717.20 - 10719.20] P:1942.59 E:0.102587 |  to this world cup I feel for the
[10719.20 - 10721.20] P:1909.49 E:0.107752 |  Dutch but I've got to say I just wonder
[10721.20 - 10723.20] P:1805.96 E:0.098537 |  whether there will be that sense
[10723.20 - 10725.20] P:1791.62 E:0.105734 |  from back in the Netherlands
[10725.20 - 10727.20] P:1833.77 E:0.103368 |  why didn't we continue with that same
[10727.20 - 10729.20] P:1799.09 E:0.090614 |  plan in extra time
[10729.20 - 10731.20] P:1592.64 E:0.101955 |  that's exactly the question I'm going to ask
[10731.20 - 10733.20] P:1598.93 E:0.104371 |  in one second but I just wanted to ask
[10733.20 - 10735.20] P:1684.99 E:0.096602 |  you about the penalty shoot up because
[10735.20 - 10737.20] P:1391.05 E:0.110772 |  when Brazil went out earlier today
[10737.20 - 10739.20] P:1749.17 E:0.096168 |  Neymar
[10739.20 - 10741.20] P:1671.91 E:0.087403 |  was up to take the fifth penalty this time
[10741.20 - 10743.20] P:1632.69 E:0.104307 |  around for Argentina
[10743.20 - 10745.20] P:1723.82 E:0.097058 |  little Messi takes the first
[10745.20 - 10747.20] P:1617.77 E:0.101152 |  and he scores Neymar didn't even get to take
[10747.20 - 10749.20] P:1700.40 E:0.079937 |  his is that
[10749.20 - 10751.20] P:1637.06 E:0.103377 |  something that Argentina were
[10751.20 - 10753.20] P:1657.62 E:0.101602 |  able to build on throughout their penalty
[10753.20 - 10755.20] P:1711.01 E:0.098328 |  shootout you're looking at me like I'm talking
[10755.20 - 10757.20] P:1794.32 E:0.121988 |  nonsense what's the weather Chris
[10757.20 - 10759.20] P:1826.00 E:0.100804 |  no no I'm looking at you I'm really trying to
[10759.20 - 10761.20] P:1836.82 E:0.100056 |  work this one out I think that the justification
[10761.20 - 10763.20] P:1742.25 E:0.096070 |  is on penalties it doesn't matter
[10763.20 - 10765.20] P:1842.92 E:0.110886 |  no matter what order you go in
[10765.20 - 10767.20] P:1776.30 E:0.087953 |  as long as you as long as you win
[10767.20 - 10769.20] P:1851.16 E:0.094762 |  I mean
[10769.20 - 10771.20] P:1867.71 E:0.108003 |  Messi's penalty was beautiful the
[10771.20 - 10773.20] P:1914.52 E:0.106645 |  way that he actually sat Nopper down because
[10773.20 - 10775.20] P:1873.47 E:0.105670 |  you know in the game he went to cross Nopper
[10775.20 - 10777.20] P:1819.11 E:0.098027 |  but he's shaped up to go the same
[10777.20 - 10779.20] P:1791.49 E:0.089236 |  way but I mean he's
[10779.20 - 10781.20] P:1839.27 E:0.096039 |  he's super clever but
[10781.20 - 10783.20] P:1811.23 E:0.104751 |  other than Fernandez all the Argentinian
[10783.20 - 10785.20] P:1726.52 E:0.104869 |  penalties we've seen some really rubbish penalties
[10785.20 - 10787.20] P:1817.14 E:0.092188 |  in this competition haven't we
[10787.20 - 10789.20] P:1774.37 E:0.115586 |  but a lot of conviction
[10789.20 - 10791.20] P:1819.96 E:0.090150 |  one from Lionel Messi in the earlier rounds
[10791.20 - 10793.20] P:1838.26 E:0.101742 |  yeah by the way what you're talking about
[10793.20 - 10795.20] P:1775.30 E:0.100525 |  Neymar that's happened before with Cristiano
[10795.20 - 10797.20] P:1832.84 E:0.106675 |  Ronaldo at a tournament he waited
[10797.20 - 10799.20] P:1815.86 E:0.094123 |  to try and get the the glory
[10799.20 - 10801.20] P:1761.09 E:0.093850 |  moment didn't get chance to take the penalty
[10801.20 - 10803.20] P:1798.01 E:0.104399 |  and so the last time that
[10803.20 - 10805.20] P:1925.71 E:0.109760 |  Portugal were involved in a shootout
[10805.20 - 10807.20] P:1844.66 E:0.091463 |  he thought I tell you what I'm going to take the first
[10807.20 - 10809.20] P:1858.15 E:0.106264 |  time this one so is that not the biggest
[10809.20 - 10811.20] P:1784.52 E:0.094408 |  pressure penalty the fifth one you know
[10811.20 - 10813.20] P:1803.21 E:0.105071 |  so I mean there's that it's an
[10813.20 - 10815.20] P:1822.68 E:0.089040 |  interesting debate isn't it
[10815.20 - 10817.20] P:1964.61 E:0.111440 |  it is but we know we know why they're
[10817.20 - 10819.20] P:1918.92 E:0.083010 |  doing the last one they want they want the
[10819.20 - 10821.20] P:1724.46 E:0.099835 |  the glory moment don't they
[10821.20 - 10823.20] P:1907.00 E:0.112288 |  maybe it's that there's more for the
[10823.20 - 10825.20] P:1779.18 E:0.097210 |  biggest moment and maybe it's that there's more
[10825.20 - 10827.20] P:1765.39 E:0.102419 |  pressure on the last one and so the highest
[10827.20 - 10829.20] P:1840.50 E:0.111323 |  level player is better able there are
[10829.20 - 10831.20] P:1846.41 E:0.105837 |  lots of reasons elsewhere but look we
[10831.20 - 10833.20] P:1772.03 E:0.113200 |  are going to get the Netherlands
[10833.20 - 10835.20] P:1669.27 E:0.115093 |  perspective on this in a second but the
[10835.20 - 10837.20] P:1755.30 E:0.102764 |  Argentina players have got their arms
[10837.20 - 10839.20] P:1706.29 E:0.096653 |  around each other they are bouncing
[10839.20 - 10841.20] P:1696.57 E:0.100637 |  leaping
[10841.20 - 10843.20] P:1609.60 E:0.110574 |  towards the Argentina fans who are over
[10843.20 - 10845.20] P:1821.50 E:0.092879 |  behind the goal to our right
[10845.20 - 10847.20] P:1697.26 E:0.109610 |  there are tens of thousands of them
[10847.20 - 10849.20] P:1708.81 E:0.105679 |  every single one it looks like has got
[10849.20 - 10851.20] P:1701.18 E:0.108666 |  their shirt over their head including
[10851.20 - 10853.20] P:1728.27 E:0.098543 |  the players they're swinging around
[10853.20 - 10855.20] P:1659.48 E:0.103577 |  they are dancing to the goal music that
[10855.20 - 10857.20] P:1574.50 E:0.089146 |  is what's been picked
[10857.20 - 10859.20] P:1675.62 E:0.101365 |  by the Argentina squad to be played
[10859.20 - 10861.20] P:1611.41 E:0.104113 |  every single match every time a goal is
[10861.20 - 10863.20] P:1774.23 E:0.101004 |  scored and every time the final whistle
[10863.20 - 10865.20] P:1728.81 E:0.100019 |  goes all in this case the winning penalty
[10865.20 - 10867.20] P:1693.74 E:0.108979 |  is scored they are celebrating
[10867.20 - 10869.20] P:1687.96 E:0.095231 |  they're absolutely harnessed
[10869.20 - 10871.20] P:1773.07 E:0.109098 |  all that emotion that those Argentina
[10871.20 - 10873.20] P:1555.53 E:0.094026 |  fans are able to bring and they are
[10873.20 - 10875.20] P:1705.68 E:0.105588 |  fantastic scenes as there are every time
[10875.20 - 10877.20] P:1806.89 E:0.091340 |  Argentina play in this
[10877.20 - 10879.20] P:1868.31 E:0.090378 |  tournament but for the Netherlands
[10879.20 - 10881.20] P:1692.25 E:0.110567 |  the other end of the pitch
[10881.20 - 10883.20] P:1782.04 E:0.090443 |  they're in a circle
[10883.20 - 10885.20] P:1828.38 E:0.101556 |  they are in a huddle
[10885.20 - 10887.20] P:1732.16 E:0.101009 |  Louis van Halen is in there with them
[10887.20 - 10889.20] P:1786.82 E:0.101266 |  they are just taking some time out quietly
[10889.20 - 10891.20] P:1819.07 E:0.094629 |  to reflect on what happened
[10891.20 - 10893.20] P:1874.96 E:0.089010 |  Marcel van der Kren
[10893.20 - 10895.20] P:1897.37 E:0.093858 |  can you put anything
[10895.20 - 10897.20] P:1873.90 E:0.090146 |  logical on what just happened
[10899.20 - 10901.20] P:1849.05 E:0.115240 |  well it was a cracking match
[10901.20 - 10903.20] P:1742.69 E:0.107483 |  actually the match we were waiting for
[10903.20 - 10905.20] P:1883.20 E:0.103739 |  and we knew
[10905.20 - 10907.20] P:1776.24 E:0.116473 |  they needed to raise that game
[10907.20 - 10909.20] P:1908.04 E:0.099434 |  but how long did we have
[10909.20 - 10911.20] P:1921.36 E:0.090202 |  to wait for it you know
[10911.20 - 10913.20] P:1847.14 E:0.118374 |  it was too long in the game
[10913.20 - 10915.20] P:1965.42 E:0.102864 |  and it was like
[10915.20 - 10917.20] P:1825.40 E:0.102451 |  Christus said it was a bonkers game
[10917.20 - 10919.20] P:1926.31 E:0.094916 |  at the end it was
[10919.20 - 10921.20] P:1725.33 E:0.106494 |  a miraculous sort of escape
[10921.20 - 10923.20] P:1789.02 E:0.106690 |  was it going to work that was all
[10923.20 - 10925.20] P:1925.88 E:0.087030 |  it was like a lottery but
[10925.20 - 10927.20] P:1847.47 E:0.105467 |  again you know we
[10927.20 - 10929.20] P:1764.12 E:0.105710 |  saw that what we've said all through
[10929.20 - 10931.20] P:1857.83 E:0.098506 |  this tournament and what I've said
[10931.20 - 10933.20] P:1860.51 E:0.104729 |  it's not enough you can't go in the world
[10933.20 - 10935.20] P:1788.17 E:0.102461 |  with such defensive football
[10935.20 - 10937.20] P:1853.92 E:0.091054 |  you need to attack the minute
[10937.20 - 10939.20] P:1980.95 E:0.095794 |  we played Dutch football
[10939.20 - 10941.20] P:1870.32 E:0.108384 |  big strike rope, wingers, gagpou on one side
[10941.20 - 10943.20] P:1849.62 E:0.097015 |  burgers on the right
[10943.20 - 10945.20] P:1955.79 E:0.099576 |  wow it was happening
[10945.20 - 10947.20] P:1714.21 E:0.106982 |  it was happening but this is what we wanted to see
[10947.20 - 10949.20] P:1882.52 E:0.108697 |  all through the tournament
[10949.20 - 10951.20] P:1897.44 E:0.093729 |  this is what van Halen should have done
[10951.20 - 10953.20] P:1913.81 E:0.103532 |  you know because we can't play like Italians
[10953.20 - 10955.20] P:1869.37 E:0.091988 |  Katzenaarche
[10955.20 - 10957.20] P:1953.06 E:0.099528 |  but then when you've done that
[10957.20 - 10959.20] P:1988.44 E:0.097727 |  then they stop doing it in extra time
[10959.20 - 10961.20] P:1911.70 E:0.105405 |  well and this is why
[10961.20 - 10963.20] P:2025.19 E:0.097098 |  Louis van Halen wanted to
[10963.20 - 10965.20] P:1696.52 E:0.107103 |  steal the show with his system
[10965.20 - 10967.20] P:1944.92 E:0.097977 |  he claimed that he wanted to
[10967.20 - 10969.20] P:1994.56 E:0.105368 |  improve the world that
[10969.20 - 10971.20] P:1978.29 E:0.098389 |  the gamers
[10971.20 - 10973.20] P:1981.44 E:0.116318 |  what did he say he valued it
[10973.20 - 10975.20] P:1850.27 E:0.106319 |  it's changed and you can't play like
[10975.20 - 10977.20] P:1978.05 E:0.096945 |  we used to anymore
[10977.20 - 10979.20] P:2001.98 E:0.100838 |  wow rubbish
[10979.20 - 10981.20] P:1880.26 E:0.110544 |  I keep it neat
[10981.20 - 10983.20] P:1878.84 E:0.110657 |  well he'd get the blame for this Marcel
[10983.20 - 10985.20] P:1872.83 E:0.102014 |  what is this on Louis van Halen's head
[10985.20 - 10987.20] P:1927.87 E:0.102538 |  absolutely I mean
[10987.20 - 10989.20] P:2007.94 E:0.108845 |  well he couldn't have told the players
[10989.20 - 10991.20] P:1947.82 E:0.108510 |  I don't believe in extra time
[10991.20 - 10993.20] P:1891.92 E:0.093515 |  he couldn't have told the players
[10993.20 - 10995.20] P:1920.79 E:0.093242 |  to stop playing
[10995.20 - 10997.20] P:1866.19 E:0.112847 |  in that way they didn't the last 15 minutes
[10997.20 - 10999.20] P:1855.29 E:0.100294 |  that's got to be on the
[10999.20 - 11001.20] P:1929.84 E:0.109684 |  players I can't for the life
[11001.20 - 11003.20] P:1916.42 E:0.100095 |  of me work out why
[11003.20 - 11005.20] P:1900.37 E:0.105467 |  he would do that stop doing what was
[11005.20 - 11007.20] P:1882.49 E:0.108866 |  been effective right well what I couldn't believe
[11007.20 - 11009.20] P:1941.10 E:0.099911 |  is that the energy level of the
[11009.20 - 11011.20] P:1946.28 E:0.093707 |  Dutch it first it went up
[11011.20 - 11013.20] P:1934.24 E:0.098329 |  of course they get adrenaline boost at the
[11013.20 - 11015.20] P:1920.86 E:0.096025 |  end of the game and then
[11015.20 - 11017.20] P:1880.02 E:0.104682 |  in the final part of that extra time
[11017.20 - 11019.20] P:1849.68 E:0.094405 |  we see that Argentina had
[11019.20 - 11021.20] P:1840.72 E:0.100204 |  more energy and I expected that
[11021.20 - 11023.20] P:1816.08 E:0.098612 |  Argentina would have you know it would
[11023.20 - 11025.20] P:1848.27 E:0.103213 |  was one and a half years ago I checked
[11025.20 - 11027.20] P:1897.93 E:0.108491 |  I think that he played under 20 minutes
[11027.20 - 11029.20] P:1926.29 E:0.093652 |  you think that that team
[11029.20 - 11031.20] P:1799.42 E:0.109118 |  hasn't got the energy but they did and I think
[11031.20 - 11033.20] P:1963.75 E:0.098256 |  that's also why the Dutch
[11033.20 - 11035.20] P:1961.09 E:0.109926 |  were in limbo
[11035.20 - 11037.20] P:1971.66 E:0.121995 |  Tim Vickery our South American football expert
[11037.20 - 11039.20] P:1871.92 E:0.113068 |  also joins us
[11039.20 - 11041.20] P:1855.84 E:0.113278 |  Tim you can hear the noise
[11041.20 - 11043.20] P:1826.55 E:0.113083 |  inside this stadium the Argentina
[11043.20 - 11045.20] P:1802.28 E:0.101678 |  players are making their way again
[11045.20 - 11047.20] P:1726.71 E:0.100857 |  back to their fans all the
[11047.20 - 11049.20] P:1707.34 E:0.109956 |  Argentina players are on the pitch including the
[11049.20 - 11051.20] P:1870.43 E:0.101942 |  substitutes all the back room
[11051.20 - 11053.20] P:1825.24 E:0.105939 |  staffer on the pitch Emi Martinez
[11053.20 - 11055.20] P:1649.64 E:0.109779 |  is back on again he's heading down to
[11055.20 - 11057.20] P:1857.41 E:0.099624 |  sing with all the supporters
[11057.20 - 11059.20] P:1612.31 E:0.112641 |  Sergio Aguero has made his way on to the pitch
[11059.20 - 11061.20] P:1752.90 E:0.102218 |  to celebrate with them they're not going
[11061.20 - 11063.20] P:1674.85 E:0.104569 |  anywhere the only place I think that might
[11063.20 - 11065.20] P:1842.64 E:0.098861 |  be better than the LaSalle stadium
[11065.20 - 11067.20] P:1785.45 E:0.102160 |  to be Argentinian tonight is Buenos Aires
[11067.20 - 11069.20] P:1893.96 E:0.088580 |  itself what will this do for
[11069.20 - 11071.20] P:1746.43 E:0.103819 |  Argentina in this tournament
[11071.20 - 11073.20] P:1982.63 E:0.072939 |  well let's reflect
[11073.20 - 11075.20] P:1834.42 E:0.099302 |  we have just seen
[11075.20 - 11077.20] P:1870.88 E:0.085339 |  and this isn't hyperbole one of the all-time
[11077.20 - 11079.20] P:1802.91 E:0.105494 |  great penalties
[11079.20 - 11081.20] P:1932.75 E:0.091740 |  Lautaro Martinez
[11081.20 - 11083.20] P:1824.51 E:0.097782 |  goes into the campaign as Argentina's
[11083.20 - 11085.20] P:1889.83 E:0.087711 |  first-choice centre-fool
[11085.20 - 11087.20] P:1892.35 E:0.111465 |  he has two goals chalked off against
[11087.20 - 11089.20] P:1833.99 E:0.115214 |  Saudis in the first game for
[11089.20 - 11091.20] P:1954.40 E:0.108341 |  very very narrow
[11091.20 - 11093.20] P:1972.55 E:0.106398 |  VAR off sides
[11093.20 - 11095.20] P:1873.24 E:0.113524 |  after that his confidence is completely
[11095.20 - 11097.20] P:1846.26 E:0.122418 |  gone he can't buy a goal in the
[11097.20 - 11099.20] P:1870.78 E:0.082328 |  previous two games they brought him on
[11099.20 - 11101.20] P:1960.46 E:0.023200 |  at the end and he's looked
