[0.00 - 4.64] P:1816.51 E:0.050986 |  CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
[4.64 - 6.68] P:1891.66 E:0.110161 |  Just slightly disorganised that,
[6.68 - 9.80] P:1867.42 E:0.101785 |  because the players were gathered together by the referee
[9.80 - 12.16] P:1929.55 E:0.097058 |  while Arsenal's players were still in their huddle
[12.16 - 13.92] P:1832.87 E:0.106036 |  and were unaware of what was happening,
[13.92 - 16.76] P:1839.96 E:0.106337 |  so that was the reason that that was a little elongated
[16.76 - 19.52] P:1787.33 E:0.101367 |  and there were a couple of referees' whistles.
[19.52 - 24.60] P:1579.70 E:0.109485 |  That a man of justice and peace is what was written
[24.60 - 29.56] P:1727.51 E:0.090497 |  on the black-and-white photograph on the big screens of Pope Francis.
[29.56 - 31.40] P:1813.64 E:0.108743 |  So we're ready to go.
[31.40 - 37.64] P:1733.99 E:0.095955 |  Both teams, both managers yesterday talking about making history.
[37.64 - 43.40] P:1786.22 E:0.096351 |  I think that's what makes this semi-final all the more interesting
[43.40 - 46.52] P:1804.63 E:0.105013 |  and intriguing the fact it's between these two clubs,
[46.52 - 48.64] P:1547.49 E:0.101071 |  Arsenal and Paris-Angeman,
[48.64 - 53.40] P:1725.50 E:0.106029 |  who have never won the famous trophy with the big handles.
[53.40 - 56.68] P:1778.52 E:0.116682 |  The referee blows his whistle and the first leg of this semi-final
[56.68 - 58.32] P:1815.92 E:0.117431 |  begins with PSG kicking off
[58.32 - 60.76] P:1812.28 E:0.102299 |  and the ball hit long-downfield by the team,
[60.76 - 63.88] P:1626.55 E:0.089202 |  and out of play for a throw-in to Arsenal.
[63.88 - 66.64] P:1692.69 E:0.108267 |  So neither club has won this trophy.
[66.64 - 71.48] P:1678.67 E:0.097949 |  One of them will be in Munich next month for the final,
[71.48 - 74.88] P:1704.20 E:0.104298 |  and there will be great disappointment for the other.
[74.88 - 77.84] P:1607.49 E:0.110973 |  Throw-in to Arsenal, up towards Bukajor, Saka,
[77.84 - 82.56] P:1633.40 E:0.089534 |  pivotal figure in that victory over the record winners,
[82.56 - 85.24] P:1648.08 E:0.104926 |  the holders, Real Madrid and the quarter-finals.
[85.32 - 88.68] P:1730.52 E:0.100986 |  Saka again, still inside his own half, tries to thread it forward.
[88.68 - 91.60] P:1686.91 E:0.095934 |  Fabian Ruiz wins it back from Saka.
[91.60 - 94.92] P:1596.14 E:0.109190 |  Here is Dempéle, the dangerous PSG number 10,
[94.92 - 96.92] P:1630.84 E:0.115864 |  a chorus of booze for Dempéle.
[96.92 - 101.56] P:1893.89 E:0.105193 |  Remember, he didn't play here in October when Arsenal won 2-0
[101.56 - 105.36] P:1825.38 E:0.101862 |  in the league phase of the competition after a breach of discipline.
[105.36 - 107.72] P:1717.57 E:0.104964 |  Luis Enrique left him out that night.
[107.72 - 109.80] P:1758.38 E:0.122605 |  Arsenal won by two goals to Niel.
[109.80 - 113.48] P:1811.80 E:0.114384 |  And then Bukajor-Saka just gets a touch on that
[113.56 - 117.24] P:1700.53 E:0.101265 |  against Nuno Mendes and the ball runs out of play near the halfway line.
[117.24 - 121.16] P:1751.30 E:0.117114 |  I don't think you can underestimate how big a call that was from Luis Enrique.
[121.16 - 124.84] P:1725.96 E:0.114567 |  That might either, because that sent a message to his group of players, hasn't it?
[124.84 - 127.76] P:1691.53 E:0.116685 |  The discipline, what he expects, you can be the star player,
[127.76 - 129.76] P:1541.46 E:0.118122 |  you can be the big player,
[129.76 - 133.64] P:1748.89 E:0.108637 |  but if you don't work hard for each other or you're not quite filling in
[133.64 - 137.04] P:1768.73 E:0.116142 |  in where you need to be in his mind, you won't play.
[137.04 - 141.68] P:1685.31 E:0.115215 |  And I think that there's no coincidence this PSG team has just grown
[141.72 - 145.48] P:1811.83 E:0.112246 |  since that moment, and now they're a pretty efficient, hard-working team
[145.48 - 148.40] P:1822.94 E:0.107169 |  that get about the pitch and try and make life difficult.
[148.40 - 150.40] P:1764.08 E:0.098855 |  Let's see how Arsenal cope without the season.
[150.40 - 153.16] P:1800.35 E:0.117700 |  Arsenal pressing them while PSG have possession,
[153.16 - 155.92] P:1881.50 E:0.106915 |  and Hikimi is forced to play the ball long downfield,
[155.92 - 158.12] P:1902.04 E:0.095979 |  and that just gives possession back to Arsenal,
[158.12 - 160.96] P:1801.18 E:0.096197 |  and Miles Lewis-Skelly knocks it across for Raya,
[160.96 - 163.04] P:1870.46 E:0.086959 |  who passes it out through the middle,
[163.04 - 165.88] P:1823.76 E:0.106489 |  and Merino was put under pressure.
[165.88 - 170.72] P:1777.25 E:0.092999 |  His pass was a little short out there to the far side,
[170.72 - 176.04] P:1803.10 E:0.091406 |  and the challenge came in, and that has resulted in a free kick to PSG
[176.04 - 180.52] P:1799.72 E:0.089849 |  for the challenge on Hikimi, ten yards inside the Arsenal half.
[180.52 - 184.64] P:1795.62 E:0.093296 |  So PSG take it short, back into the centre-circle.
[184.64 - 187.48] P:1716.06 E:0.102993 |  Beautiful night after what's been a beautiful day in London.
[187.48 - 192.44] P:1772.37 E:0.094815 |  The sun has shone, it's been warm, and it is dry here tonight,
[192.44 - 195.88] P:1854.95 E:0.105525 |  and the PSG supporters with a massive banner, which reads,
[195.88 - 200.60] P:1860.58 E:0.089896 |  Ultra has been stayed in position right at the front of their section.
[200.60 - 203.04] P:1754.90 E:0.103770 |  Many of them are bare-chested in there as well,
[203.04 - 206.60] P:1737.57 E:0.105862 |  familiar area for the away fans at the Emirates Stadium.
[206.60 - 209.24] P:1734.44 E:0.110716 |  Vettiniya, the former Wolves midfielder,
[209.24 - 212.68] P:1763.82 E:0.110130 |  who has really grown in this Luis Enrique team.
[212.68 - 214.56] P:1830.48 E:0.103508 |  Here he is with a curly black hair.
[214.56 - 218.00] P:1754.45 E:0.096113 |  He's quite a short midfield.
[218.00 - 219.72] P:1751.62 E:0.099700 |  Chvau Neves and Vettiniya,
[219.72 - 222.80] P:1808.49 E:0.099815 |  Fabian Ruiz, the Spanish-European championship winner,
[222.80 - 225.40] P:1794.68 E:0.083610 |  is the tallest of the three of them.
[225.44 - 229.60] P:1820.56 E:0.101716 |  Ball out towards the right-hand side, and PSG now enjoying a feel of the ball.
[229.60 - 232.32] P:1709.19 E:0.097287 |  This is no problem for Arsenal in that sense.
[232.32 - 235.08] P:1701.78 E:0.107888 |  They're quite happy for PSG to have the ball in and here.
[235.08 - 237.72] P:1776.18 E:0.102023 |  Martyn Odegaard leading the press for Arsenal.
[237.72 - 240.88] P:1845.85 E:0.108216 |  Dembele has dropped deep and he's received it in the centre-circle,
[240.88 - 242.92] P:1814.21 E:0.098734 |  and Dembele is off on a run through the middle.
[242.92 - 245.40] P:1931.24 E:0.096963 |  He gives it out to Cavarra-Tecalier on the left-hand side.
[245.40 - 247.92] P:1853.75 E:0.102131 |  Cavarra-Tecalier against Timber, stabs it back to the edge of the air.
[247.92 - 249.72] P:1986.61 E:0.098694 |  Dembele with a shot, it's in!
[249.72 - 252.76] P:1930.64 E:0.103259 |  Through a crowd of players, enough opposed!
[252.76 - 254.84] P:1953.40 E:0.110015 |  PSG have an early lead!
[254.88 - 258.76] P:1733.43 E:0.113051 |  And it's their danger man, the big danger man, the top scorer,
[258.76 - 262.56] P:1823.63 E:0.110508 |  Dembele with his 33rd of the season,
[262.56 - 266.72] P:1823.66 E:0.107207 |  who has struck Arsenal-Neal, Paris-Anchorman won,
[266.72 - 269.64] P:1832.96 E:0.090581 |  less than four minutes played at the Emirates.
[269.64 - 274.36] P:1675.16 E:0.102205 |  Wow, it's the purpose and the speed of Cavarra-Tecalier.
[274.36 - 278.44] P:1610.25 E:0.107103 |  That was just absolutely blistering, I have to say.
[278.44 - 284.24] P:1692.63 E:0.101606 |  They play through the lines really well, PSG into midfield, it goes wide,
[284.28 - 288.00] P:1645.79 E:0.104864 |  and the distance that Timber has, he just can't make it up.
[288.00 - 291.32] P:1693.70 E:0.115782 |  And the speed that Cavarra-Tecalier gets on the ball,
[291.32 - 294.16] P:1702.23 E:0.110392 |  and his first touch is just to drive into the box,
[294.16 - 296.64] P:1772.82 E:0.093366 |  he's so aggressive with his decision-making,
[296.64 - 299.12] P:1757.57 E:0.094120 |  he draws the midfield plays towards him,
[299.12 - 302.28] P:1710.86 E:0.094214 |  and Dembele's just pulled out on the edge,
[302.28 - 304.60] P:1676.09 E:0.104284 |  he flicks the ball to the outside of his right boot,
[304.60 - 305.92] P:1738.86 E:0.097740 |  and it's bouncing towards him,
[305.92 - 309.56] P:1672.84 E:0.113721 |  it's actually a really well-controlled effort with his left foot,
[309.56 - 312.04] P:1663.81 E:0.113911 |  right on the 18-yard box line,
[312.08 - 315.20] P:1789.61 E:0.115747 |  and he just bounces the ball towards that far post,
[315.20 - 319.40] P:1725.92 E:0.108792 |  strikes it into the ground, and it bubbles in off the post,
[319.40 - 322.36] P:1746.58 E:0.098844 |  and in the back of the net, what a start for PSG.
[322.36 - 326.84] P:1739.02 E:0.087824 |  Super goal, Lewis Enrique couldn't have asked for anything more there.
[326.84 - 330.96] P:1832.32 E:0.098023 |  I'm sure that there's a lot of that in that move, in that goal,
[330.96 - 332.72] P:1765.92 E:0.101177 |  that he has preached to them.
[332.72 - 336.20] P:1900.23 E:0.098599 |  Dembele dropping deep, so deep into his own half,
[336.20 - 338.12] P:1813.54 E:0.095237 |  to receive possession in the centre-circle,
[338.12 - 340.64] P:1749.44 E:0.110103 |  Arsenal didn't deal with him, there were nowhere near him,
[340.64 - 342.52] P:1685.27 E:0.089789 |  he was able to take the ball on through the middle,
[342.52 - 344.48] P:1759.50 E:0.092215 |  then the man that was signed in January,
[344.48 - 347.16] P:1795.64 E:0.094053 |  the dangerous Georgian, Kavaric-Kalia on the left-hand side,
[347.16 - 350.28] P:1682.29 E:0.096784 |  running at Kimber, and then Dembele finding a position,
[350.28 - 352.48] P:1613.49 E:0.101931 |  edge of the area, bang, 1-0.
[352.48 - 356.24] P:1541.88 E:0.104484 |  He was powerful, wasn't he? Kavaric-Kalia, the way he went at it,
[356.24 - 358.84] P:1675.52 E:0.085628 |  I mean, the speed, his touch, it was just...
[358.84 - 360.12] P:1605.36 E:0.111563 |  It was medicine, wouldn't it?
[360.12 - 363.40] P:1751.16 E:0.101823 |  It had a real feel of purpose, and the little off-load,
[363.40 - 366.80] P:1741.14 E:0.092160 |  the flick with the outside of his right boot to the edge of the box,
[366.80 - 368.76] P:1681.79 E:0.117229 |  and like you said, Dembele just pulled in there,
[368.80 - 371.60] P:1669.63 E:0.108944 |  pulled the trigger first time, and it's on target,
[371.60 - 373.44] P:1547.29 E:0.104254 |  it's actually a tough ball to score from,
[373.44 - 375.52] P:1710.06 E:0.100198 |  but it does so well to hit the target,
[375.52 - 378.64] P:1822.97 E:0.092391 |  it's a cracking start from the Paris team.
[378.64 - 382.08] P:1771.88 E:0.107459 |  Well, Dembele, as I say, 33 goals now this season,
[382.08 - 383.96] P:1711.69 E:0.099597 |  8 in the Champions League,
[383.96 - 387.60] P:1727.36 E:0.098914 |  he'd not scored in his last five appearances,
[387.60 - 390.24] P:1669.75 E:0.098217 |  he's kept one for the big occasion tonight,
[390.24 - 393.64] P:1559.41 E:0.099957 |  and PSG 1-0 up early on.
[393.64 - 397.32] P:1637.94 E:0.094888 |  It's not going to be Real Madrid all over again, is it?
[397.36 - 402.80] P:1755.71 E:0.091495 |  Clearly not, but Arsenal has plenty of time left in this tie,
[402.80 - 405.40] P:1740.29 E:0.099621 |  and they have to just gather themselves together.
[405.40 - 407.92] P:1765.61 E:0.099825 |  I mean, it's given PSG a massive boost,
[407.92 - 410.96] P:1689.21 E:0.103059 |  and I was saying that Arsenal won't be too disappointed
[410.96 - 414.24] P:1864.14 E:0.105396 |  at the ball. Long throw to the near post, flicked on by Martyn Alley,
[414.24 - 416.40] P:1805.00 E:0.090916 |  the big Don Miro-Romo is there to catch it now.
[416.40 - 419.16] P:1679.32 E:0.103520 |  Yeah, they're not too bothered if they don't have the ball,
[419.16 - 421.16] P:1598.37 E:0.097842 |  because they're set up so well defensively,
[421.16 - 424.76] P:1747.09 E:0.107592 |  but PSG did play through them really nicely there
[424.76 - 425.88] P:1632.77 E:0.095537 |  with a couple of passes,
[425.92 - 428.48] P:1803.53 E:0.102525 |  and that's something that will just maybe keep Arsenal
[428.48 - 430.08] P:1781.02 E:0.118542 |  on the back foot a little bit.
[430.08 - 433.56] P:1741.82 E:0.103844 |  Handball given against Timber, who dispossessed Nuno Mendes,
[433.56 - 434.84] P:1539.06 E:0.092600 |  but the assistant quickening flag,
[434.84 - 437.56] P:1712.41 E:0.093577 |  with a free kick to PSG in their own left-back position.
[437.56 - 439.72] P:1663.19 E:0.106533 |  So this is BBC Radio 5 Live,
[439.72 - 444.76] P:1809.45 E:0.095529 |  the atmosphere already punctured by that early goal for PSG
[444.76 - 447.20] P:1773.56 E:0.087127 |  in the fourth minute.
[447.20 - 451.00] P:1685.06 E:0.095462 |  So Paris Saint-Germain, who did reach the final,
[451.00 - 453.84] P:1675.46 E:0.105383 |  if you remember, Thomas Tuchel's Paris Saint-Germain,
[453.88 - 457.24] P:1872.35 E:0.112071 |  their only Champions League final, the Covid season,
[457.24 - 458.44] P:1945.28 E:0.110630 |  when they lost to Bayern Munich,
[458.44 - 461.68] P:1891.49 E:0.101362 |  when the Parisian Kingsley Coleman scored the goal against them,
[461.68 - 463.52] P:1749.96 E:0.084635 |  against Thomas Tuchel's side.
[463.52 - 467.68] P:1666.66 E:0.077212 |  But they are, as we've said,
[467.68 - 470.48] P:1764.32 E:0.096970 |  over the course of the second half of this season,
[470.48 - 475.16] P:1673.18 E:0.094119 |  this is the best side of Paris Saint-Germain that we've seen,
[475.16 - 478.00] P:1709.70 E:0.105897 |  as they go all the way back to Don Miro-Romo on the edge of his area.
[478.00 - 481.00] P:1639.20 E:0.104293 |  Yeah, I'm just looking at Arsenal's midfield as well.
[481.00 - 483.84] P:1681.96 E:0.100583 |  I think Marino is actually playing really deep,
[483.84 - 487.00] P:1765.34 E:0.105071 |  and Ryerson and Oda Garda getting higher up the pitch.
[487.00 - 490.60] P:1696.83 E:0.101905 |  If anything, Marino is the deepest midfield player in Arsenal's trio.
[490.60 - 494.72] P:1801.92 E:0.094650 |  Quite the early setback for Miquel Arterto and his team,
[494.72 - 496.92] P:1621.95 E:0.086742 |  but as Matt Upson rightly says,
[496.92 - 499.44] P:1594.87 E:0.101385 |  there's a long, long way to go.
[499.44 - 504.52] P:1619.07 E:0.096297 |  Fabian Ruiz, second leg is next Wednesday, so week tomorrow.
[504.52 - 506.16] P:1656.41 E:0.104103 |  You'll hear that with us on 5 Live.
[506.16 - 508.72] P:1533.73 E:0.103855 |  We'll be live in the park de France.
[508.76 - 512.48] P:1620.56 E:0.115010 |  But right now, PSG with the edge, and here's Hikimi.
[512.48 - 514.72] P:1747.77 E:0.106327 |  Do it, do it at the edge of the area.
[514.72 - 516.52] P:1615.72 E:0.076291 |  Brilliant little run from him.
[516.52 - 518.00] P:1862.77 E:0.102041 |  Such quick footwork there.
[518.00 - 520.96] P:1675.44 E:0.084952 |  Found a bit of space on the edge of the penalty area,
[520.96 - 522.08] P:1337.54 E:0.093231 |  but it was blocked away.
[522.08 - 524.24] P:1669.03 E:0.100426 |  Comes out now as the ball is lifted over the top,
[524.24 - 526.52] P:1793.88 E:0.108756 |  but all the way through by Dembele.
[526.52 - 533.36] P:1796.12 E:0.095385 |  For Ryert to catch the ball as it bounced up in front of his body.
[533.36 - 535.44] P:1692.35 E:0.097194 |  Saliba playing the ball across the back,
[535.44 - 537.60] P:1775.13 E:0.100734 |  and Rice on the edge of the area.
[537.60 - 539.68] P:1678.23 E:0.096507 |  And then Saliba again,
[539.68 - 541.84] P:1713.03 E:0.105318 |  playing it back into the box to Ryert,
[541.84 - 546.72] P:1803.39 E:0.099014 |  who very carefully passes it out to Declan Rice.
[546.72 - 550.68] P:1576.48 E:0.091870 |  And then Arsenal begin to move forward, Timbac.
[550.68 - 554.36] P:1656.61 E:0.089672 |  The Arsenal right back with the PSG left back
[554.36 - 556.96] P:1643.02 E:0.105730 |  putting pressure on him, so Arsenal have to play around him,
[556.96 - 557.92] P:1786.60 E:0.085863 |  but they do.
[557.92 - 562.52] P:1799.87 E:0.117016 |  Rice, man of the match in both legs against Real Madrid to Marino.
[562.52 - 565.24] P:1846.01 E:0.103262 |  Now here's Martinelli into the match for the first time.
[565.24 - 567.44] P:1830.70 E:0.111973 |  Martinelli beats his man, goes for the byline,
[567.44 - 569.36] P:1837.35 E:0.115746 |  and then there's a deflection there,
[569.36 - 571.76] P:1891.00 E:0.110673 |  which takes it behind Grasnor's first corner.
[571.76 - 574.00] P:1855.13 E:0.115013 |  Yeah, it's exactly what Arsenal want.
[574.00 - 576.24] P:1845.75 E:0.115368 |  They're delighted with a set piece of corner.
[576.24 - 580.68] P:1756.94 E:0.108680 |  Martinelli, you just feel whenever he squares up Hakimi on that far side,
[580.68 - 582.84] P:1760.42 E:0.113031 |  he's just going to want to go for the outside of him.
[582.84 - 585.08] P:1771.64 E:0.110704 |  And even if he doesn't get the cross into the box,
[585.08 - 587.48] P:1844.80 E:0.103276 |  Hakimi's going to block it out for a corner.
[587.48 - 590.68] P:1912.16 E:0.100213 |  Arsenal can get set up, and this is something that PSG
[590.68 - 591.96] P:1747.75 E:0.097783 |  they must have worked on, John,
[591.96 - 594.92] P:1884.56 E:0.099351 |  because it's such a key weapon that Arsenal have,
[594.92 - 598.16] P:1918.11 E:0.100414 |  but it hasn't been as strengthened there this season, PSG.
[598.16 - 600.48] P:1927.09 E:0.105291 |  So it's a corner. I see someone's got a laser.
[600.48 - 602.12] P:1829.78 E:0.102912 |  You can see the laser pen, can't you?
[602.12 - 606.08] P:1974.00 E:0.108739 |  That green light is darting around, trying to put PSG off.
[606.08 - 609.92] P:1927.80 E:0.100958 |  So, you know, could do without that, obviously.
[609.92 - 612.92] P:2007.57 E:0.100998 |  So it's a corner. Declan Rice to take it from the left-hand side.
[612.92 - 616.52] P:1965.70 E:0.092936 |  Arsenal so potent as, I'm sure you know, with set pieces.
[616.52 - 622.88] P:1898.80 E:0.092548 |  Rice is a deep one there, and it's headed across goal by Marino,
[622.92 - 626.08] P:1790.13 E:0.112974 |  and then PSG get it away, and Hakimi on the chase.
[626.08 - 629.20] P:1700.41 E:0.116956 |  Trossard with a challenge. Hakimi goes down,
[629.20 - 633.88] P:1711.43 E:0.103957 |  and referee Vincic is straight across with the yellow card for Trossard.
[633.88 - 637.76] P:1739.02 E:0.098408 |  He tried with his body language there, Trossard,
[637.76 - 640.72] P:1766.58 E:0.096669 |  to suggest there was nothing in that, but the referee's seen that
[640.72 - 644.08] P:1830.63 E:0.093427 |  as a foul that broke up the PSG counterattack.
[644.08 - 646.88] P:1778.91 E:0.085611 |  Free kick, Paris Saint-Germain, yellow card, Trossard.
[646.88 - 649.72] P:1591.18 E:0.086203 |  Yeah, I mean, Hakimi's got a bit of pace, isn't he?
[649.72 - 653.88] P:1792.95 E:0.107226 |  Wow, he really put the burners on Trossard, running back to the halfway line,
[653.88 - 655.28] P:1697.35 E:0.099177 |  and I'm just looking at the replay.
[655.28 - 658.76] P:1730.94 E:0.100587 |  There probably is enough contact from Trossard.
[658.76 - 661.48] P:1786.45 E:0.107040 |  You're running at that speed, you can't put your arms all over a player,
[661.48 - 664.36] P:1728.13 E:0.100883 |  and he goes down, you're going to pick up a yellow card,
[664.36 - 669.32] P:1691.01 E:0.091023 |  and I think the referee probably is justified to dish that one out.
[669.32 - 672.68] P:1721.87 E:0.107404 |  That reminds me as well, Matt, to mention that all of the yellow cards,
[672.68 - 675.04] P:1729.01 E:0.091676 |  players who were on yellow cards and inverted commas,
[675.04 - 677.32] P:1813.44 E:0.101507 |  they were all wiped after the quarter-finals.
[677.32 - 680.44] P:1660.54 E:0.095129 |  So, part is suspended for this, but all yellow cards wiped.
[680.44 - 683.64] P:1721.55 E:0.092381 |  So, it's a clean slate to begin the semi-finals.
[683.64 - 685.72] P:1693.03 E:0.097177 |  Dembele now out to the right-hand side.
[685.72 - 690.04] P:1836.36 E:0.093505 |  Here is Douay, Douay with that blonde highlights, shoots low,
[690.04 - 692.00] P:1763.27 E:0.087446 |  but Raya's able to go down to his left.
[692.00 - 694.32] P:1742.32 E:0.118365 |  I think it might even have been going wide anyway,
[694.32 - 698.32] P:1782.28 E:0.094451 |  but he misshated, and it was a comfortable one for Raya to go down to his left.
[698.32 - 702.04] P:1740.96 E:0.094687 |  Sharp start, John, isn't it, from Paris, I have to say.
[702.04 - 702.64] P:1626.94 E:0.100229 |  Again.
[702.64 - 706.92] P:1668.74 E:0.099571 |  Again, I mean, we're talking about they're not in sparkly form of,
[706.92 - 709.96] P:1676.79 E:0.094905 |  you know, the last four or five games that they have started this game,
[709.96 - 713.04] P:1661.26 E:0.097251 |  the supreme purpose confidence.
[713.04 - 714.56] P:1612.74 E:0.104387 |  They look really, really sharp.
[714.56 - 717.80] P:1669.36 E:0.108832 |  The team that knocked out Aston Bella, the team that knocked out Liverpool,
[717.80 - 721.64] P:1702.55 E:0.105182 |  the team that hammered Manchester City in the park, the friends and the league.
[721.64 - 724.40] P:1789.41 E:0.098765 |  Here's Vettiniar as Arsenal have lost possession.
[724.40 - 727.48] P:1595.18 E:0.093775 |  Vettiniar flicking a pass out towards the far side.
[727.48 - 732.12] P:1672.77 E:0.097239 |  Douay just has to backtrack the 19-year-old and then pull a pass to William Pattshaw,
[732.12 - 736.28] P:1745.63 E:0.097489 |  the impressive Ecuadorian central defender, another of the youngsters.
[736.28 - 741.24] P:1721.12 E:0.112437 |  23 years old with the experienced captain, Marquinhos, the Brazilian captain,
[741.24 - 743.72] P:1673.18 E:0.105557 |  to his right, here's Nuno Mendes,
[743.72 - 748.76] P:1739.13 E:0.089646 |  whose stock seemed to have absolutely soared this season.
[748.76 - 753.52] P:1747.54 E:0.094378 |  Remember how the two fullbacks scored the first two goals at Vila Park in the second leg?
[753.52 - 759.88] P:1666.46 E:0.089582 |  Hakimi with the early opening goal there, and Nuno Mendes scored in both legs against Aston Bella.
[759.88 - 763.44] P:1695.52 E:0.097789 |  And that third goal in the first leg proved to be so crucial.
[763.44 - 765.88] P:1767.30 E:0.111197 |  Here he is again, the Portuguese, the number 25.
[766.48 - 770.84] P:1681.53 E:0.108833 |  Passing it forward to Cabaret's Kehlia, who is challenged by Timber,
[770.84 - 774.12] P:1729.59 E:0.107130 |  who tried to get his leg around Cabaret's Kehlia,
[774.12 - 778.04] P:1815.66 E:0.098327 |  and he took the ball away, which he did, but he caught the scarves of the Georgian as well.
[778.04 - 779.56] P:1773.97 E:0.083090 |  And it's a free kick to PSG.
[779.56 - 782.04] P:1742.11 E:0.103327 |  Yes, a fair old calf to catch as well, isn't it?
[782.04 - 786.20] P:1717.06 E:0.109947 |  He's pretty strong, Cabaret's Kehlia, and he just plants himself really well.
[786.20 - 789.48] P:1963.58 E:0.101619 |  Long pass over to the right-hand side, Douay gets it down, he's into the box now,
[789.48 - 795.16] P:1821.26 E:0.096520 |  plays it back to Hakimi, who goes full 360 degrees as Arsenal force PSG back to the halfway line.
[795.16 - 798.28] P:1774.41 E:0.094898 |  Makiños now out again to the Kehlia,
[798.28 - 801.96] P:1684.77 E:0.102179 |  and then PSG begin the build-up again from the halfway line.
[801.96 - 805.80] P:1782.44 E:0.101876 |  So, Paris-Angeman with the early goal, he just joined us on five-live.
[805.80 - 808.36] P:1849.43 E:0.097870 |  Here is Cabaret's Kehlia, who's set it up for Dembele.
[808.36 - 812.24] P:1712.92 E:0.093817 |  Cabaret's Kehlia, Arsenal have got two men on him, Saka is back with Timber,
[812.24 - 814.76] P:1910.07 E:0.104357 |  still going, Cabaret's Kehlia trying to work a corner,
[814.76 - 820.04] P:1883.16 E:0.094266 |  which he does off the shins of Timber, and a corner to PSG from the left.
[820.04 - 824.20] P:1662.19 E:0.098807 |  I mean, Saka's dropping all the way back in to double up with Timber in those 1v1s,
[824.28 - 827.32] P:1710.72 E:0.092116 |  and then with Cabaret's Kehlia, he's a tough customer.
[827.32 - 830.60] P:1745.09 E:0.093778 |  They know he can go either way, it's so tricky for Timber.
[830.60 - 832.84] P:1701.49 E:0.107369 |  You don't know whether he wants to go on the outside or the inside,
[832.84 - 836.44] P:1586.90 E:0.083127 |  and he's just as devastating with either foot.
[836.44 - 841.32] P:1697.63 E:0.099646 |  So, it is a corner for the fishers, just talking to Mikhail Artheta,
[841.32 - 846.60] P:1649.77 E:0.093313 |  because the set-piece coach, of course, Jovair, is in the coaching area as well.
[846.60 - 848.84] P:1704.61 E:0.098767 |  So, there's a bit of discussion going on there.
[848.84 - 851.16] P:1640.18 E:0.100221 |  Douay gets it back, crosses in towards the back post,
[851.24 - 852.76] P:1718.08 E:0.103551 |  which is headed down, then stab back,
[852.76 - 856.20] P:1618.72 E:0.098640 |  Hakimi with a shot across the penalty area, that's blocked in there,
[856.20 - 858.76] P:1568.65 E:0.113548 |  Shroudnevez there, back to Hakimi again,
[858.76 - 861.88] P:1742.59 E:0.111411 |  all dangerous looking, Ball, which is headed by Marquinhos,
[861.88 - 865.64] P:1790.91 E:0.102489 |  but close enough to Raya to make quick ground to his right and catch it.
[865.64 - 868.04] P:1655.66 E:0.099746 |  Yeah, it's a nice delivery in, and Marquinhos,
[868.04 - 872.76] P:1684.27 E:0.098099 |  who had stayed up from the set play, was just floating around in the middle of the box,
[872.76 - 876.36] P:1665.71 E:0.096948 |  and it came onto his head, he got a glancing header onto the ball,
[876.36 - 880.60] P:1705.69 E:0.102056 |  and it's another chance for PSG, really, I mean, safely into the hands of Raya,
[880.68 - 882.12] P:1662.49 E:0.103490 |  but another warning shot.
[882.12 - 883.64] P:1861.99 E:0.101814 |  This already feels edgy to me.
[883.64 - 884.52] P:1691.59 E:0.092214 |  It does, yeah.
[884.52 - 890.60] P:1752.48 E:0.097418 |  It's had that start, it's been such a confident, controlling start from PSG, it really has.
[892.36 - 894.68] P:1718.38 E:0.118482 |  Arsenal win a free kick on the half-way line,
[894.68 - 897.72] P:1760.38 E:0.110097 |  and Trossard tries to get one of the PSG players' boot,
[897.72 - 900.52] P:1795.75 E:0.093992 |  there are a couple of them there, tried to take it quickly,
[901.56 - 904.28] P:1693.39 E:0.112795 |  it's hit into, well, Trossard is saying here,
[904.28 - 906.20] P:1667.21 E:0.110839 |  I've already got a yellow card, what about that?
[907.08 - 913.72] P:1695.07 E:0.098009 |  Luis Enrique has just come off his Arsenal dugout seat to have a word about that as well,
[913.72 - 917.72] P:1709.23 E:0.091690 |  and all that happens is, referee says, just a free kick on the half-way line,
[917.72 - 922.28] P:1712.48 E:0.113814 |  so set piece, and actually, Ben Belly has just thrown the ball back to Raya,
[922.28 - 925.00] P:1720.89 E:0.087859 |  suggesting that Arsenal are going to take this from the wrong place,
[925.00 - 926.44] P:1859.11 E:0.093217 |  so the goalkeeper's going to take this,
[926.44 - 928.44] P:1717.27 E:0.087792 |  he's going to strike this long downfield,
[928.44 - 931.56] P:1560.37 E:0.098880 |  Arsenal nil Paris Saint-Germain won,
[931.64 - 935.80] P:1522.94 E:0.083137 |  tomorrow night, Barcelona against Inter,
[935.80 - 938.84] P:1547.66 E:0.103859 |  so we'll have news of that on Five Lives Sport,
[938.84 - 943.32] P:1669.67 E:0.101856 |  Raya with this long, long free kick that is over the top of Merino,
[943.88 - 946.36] P:1769.75 E:0.102647 |  won't reach that, and it skips off the surface,
[946.36 - 948.12] P:1633.24 E:0.097520 |  all of the advertising hoardings,
[948.12 - 952.68] P:1784.07 E:0.092178 |  and into probably about 150 photographers who are behind that goal,
[953.24 - 957.08] P:1782.89 E:0.098565 |  behind the PSG goal, they are there to see Arsenal goals.
[957.72 - 959.32] P:1756.87 E:0.096274 |  We've not had a sniff of one yet,
[959.40 - 960.68] P:1645.30 E:0.115341 |  there's a few here, aren't there?
[960.68 - 963.08] P:1833.34 E:0.105731 |  I mean, it was busy getting to the stadium earlier,
[963.08 - 965.96] P:1836.98 E:0.101094 |  a lot of attention on this game, but David Raya,
[965.96 - 967.64] P:1896.77 E:0.108536 |  I mean, that is taking it to the extreme,
[968.36 - 970.12] P:1802.63 E:0.098114 |  I know Arsenal want to set plays in the box,
[970.12 - 972.36] P:1886.80 E:0.100319 |  but I mean, he's just come all the way up to the half-way line
[972.36 - 974.60] P:1808.91 E:0.093528 |  to launch that free kick into the box,
[974.60 - 977.96] P:1823.43 E:0.087962 |  they really are trying to test that PSG back for.
[977.96 - 980.92] P:1802.24 E:0.096798 |  So no clean sheet for Arsenal tonight,
[980.92 - 982.52] P:1822.71 E:0.105106 |  as Audegarde plays it over the top,
[982.52 - 984.68] P:1923.96 E:0.091849 |  this is for Martín Alicace, Hakimi,
[984.68 - 986.84] P:1784.57 E:0.095415 |  he's able to pull it up and away.
[986.84 - 988.68] P:1771.29 E:0.098484 |  I'm not sure he's going to get too much change out,
[988.76 - 991.16] P:1685.72 E:0.103637 |  Hakimi on the run inside of things tonight,
[991.16 - 993.56] P:1784.08 E:0.084543 |  he looks pretty fit and quick, Hakimi,
[993.56 - 996.52] P:1810.42 E:0.097008 |  I think Martín Alicace is going to have to liven up his game.
[996.52 - 998.28] P:1661.56 E:0.089687 |  Yes, he's one of the best as well, isn't he?
[999.96 - 1002.44] P:1682.45 E:0.099628 |  Latiniya makes a run forward down the right-hand side,
[1002.44 - 1004.60] P:1792.16 E:0.103490 |  now Fabian Ruiz, here is Kavaric Calia,
[1004.60 - 1006.76] P:1754.30 E:0.105631 |  getting the ball down, running at Timber again,
[1006.76 - 1007.72] P:1936.62 E:0.095157 |  into the penalty area,
[1007.72 - 1009.80] P:1784.08 E:0.111161 |  three Arsenal men are there, he's found a way through,
[1009.80 - 1013.00] P:1818.02 E:0.099269 |  he's gone down, oh, was that contact there?
[1013.00 - 1014.76] P:1809.99 E:0.102511 |  Referee says no penalty,
[1014.76 - 1017.56] P:1862.69 E:0.109417 |  Kavaric Calia gets up and runs towards the referee,
[1017.72 - 1019.16] P:1735.50 E:0.094675 |  he's turned his back on him,
[1019.16 - 1022.76] P:1855.71 E:0.105185 |  and Kavaric Calia now palms apart to the fourth official,
[1022.76 - 1028.28] P:1882.70 E:0.092520 |  and clearly here, this is a bid to get VAR to look at this,
[1028.28 - 1029.72] P:1924.05 E:0.107365 |  which of course they'll be doing anyway.
[1030.28 - 1034.84] P:1649.09 E:0.092125 |  Well, I mean, it's either a foul or for me, a dive,
[1034.84 - 1036.60] P:1763.01 E:0.090025 |  I mean, there's no kind of in between,
[1036.60 - 1037.64] P:1678.59 E:0.122631 |  I mean, he's running away,
[1038.28 - 1040.36] P:1851.80 E:0.111210 |  remonstrating with the referee, arms in the air,
[1040.36 - 1042.44] P:1770.65 E:0.096887 |  really adamant that it's a penalty,
[1042.44 - 1044.44] P:1785.66 E:0.098247 |  when there were three players he had to go through,
[1044.44 - 1046.28] P:1686.65 E:0.092624 |  I couldn't really see if there was contact or not.
[1046.36 - 1050.04] P:1793.47 E:0.108378 |  I think the question there is, did he initiate the contact?
[1050.04 - 1052.44] P:1766.20 E:0.107986 |  How did he actually flick his legs
[1052.44 - 1054.28] P:1763.49 E:0.110261 |  against the Arsenal defender, all vice versa?
[1054.28 - 1056.36] P:1733.42 E:0.102220 |  It looked like that, because he was trying to squeeze for a gap
[1056.36 - 1058.20] P:1654.10 E:0.107446 |  that just wasn't there, there were three Arsenal defenders.
[1058.20 - 1059.88] P:1804.08 E:0.116896 |  That's a foul for Kavaric Calia.
[1060.60 - 1062.44] P:1804.00 E:0.115895 |  Halfway inside his own half, this one,
[1062.44 - 1066.20] P:1702.31 E:0.093880 |  Timber has gone in there, and that was,
[1066.20 - 1067.96] P:1737.52 E:0.106548 |  it was quite a heavy challenge there,
[1067.96 - 1070.68] P:1847.87 E:0.102922 |  and the PSG captain, Markinios, has gone to the referee,
[1071.24 - 1074.84] P:1817.43 E:0.101431 |  also Fabian Ruiz, one of the most experienced players in this team,
[1074.84 - 1077.96] P:1689.35 E:0.091291 |  they're both making the point, and let's just see,
[1077.96 - 1079.24] P:1808.55 E:0.103363 |  this could be a big moment here,
[1079.24 - 1082.84] P:1930.72 E:0.088958 |  if he decides to show a yellow card to Timber for this,
[1082.84 - 1084.84] P:1723.12 E:0.094577 |  that is the Arsenal right back,
[1084.84 - 1087.08] P:1895.32 E:0.091308 |  and Kavaric Calia already looks
[1087.08 - 1089.32] P:1889.38 E:0.099065 |  as though he's in the mood to have a good night,
[1089.32 - 1090.44] P:1829.71 E:0.097949 |  and it's not a yellow card.
[1090.44 - 1091.88] P:1707.29 E:0.089079 |  No, he's got away with that Timber.
[1092.44 - 1094.92] P:1772.30 E:0.097393 |  I mean, he's kind of decided enough's enough,
[1094.92 - 1096.52] P:1703.14 E:0.087818 |  and he's gone through the back of him,
[1096.52 - 1099.24] P:1705.78 E:0.105822 |  really late on the halfway line, there's just no need for it.
[1100.20 - 1102.60] P:1705.50 E:0.117554 |  I mean, just having to look at the replay of the penalty shot,
[1102.60 - 1105.56] P:1697.04 E:0.097476 |  there was a left arm of Timber that comes out,
[1105.56 - 1108.44] P:1761.51 E:0.106742 |  stretched around the waist of Kavaric Calia,
[1108.44 - 1111.64] P:1734.56 E:0.084870 |  and I have to say, he's through all three of those defenders,
[1111.64 - 1114.28] P:1773.73 E:0.099502 |  he's managed to worm his way all the way through,
[1114.28 - 1117.88] P:1700.29 E:0.102814 |  I can see why he's got up and ran after the referee,
[1117.88 - 1121.48] P:1763.87 E:0.103245 |  I mean, that was an interesting call, that one.
[1121.48 - 1126.76] P:1828.72 E:0.094948 |  He did throw himself down, and there was not contact on his legs,
[1126.76 - 1129.72] P:1772.40 E:0.099997 |  no, but it was the arm around his middle.
[1129.72 - 1131.96] P:1758.02 E:0.091066 |  Correct, and I think, was it enough?
[1131.96 - 1134.04] P:1675.17 E:0.097604 |  I think that they must have arrived at the decision,
[1134.04 - 1136.52] P:1697.16 E:0.083088 |  BAR, to say the contact's there,
[1136.52 - 1138.60] P:1644.29 E:0.088149 |  but it's not enough to send him to the ground,
[1138.60 - 1141.00] P:1640.80 E:0.095618 |  so we'll stay away, it's not a clear and obvious error,
[1141.00 - 1142.92] P:1639.35 E:0.082797 |  but you feel if the referee had given it,
[1142.92 - 1145.32] P:1538.82 E:0.088766 |  I don't think they'd overturn it, no.
[1145.32 - 1146.12] P:1620.49 E:0.095858 |  It would have been a penalty.
[1146.12 - 1147.32] P:1648.08 E:0.093602 |  There was something there.
[1147.32 - 1151.56] P:1760.08 E:0.088524 |  But it's the right decision not to overturn it and give a penalty.
[1151.56 - 1153.00] P:1539.38 E:0.087738 |  Correct, I agree with that.
[1153.00 - 1155.40] P:1739.00 E:0.106874 |  Arsenal, nil, Paris Saint-Germain won,
[1155.96 - 1159.24] P:1842.45 E:0.099200 |  they're living on the edge Arsenal, already in this tie,
[1159.24 - 1161.56] P:1795.45 E:0.097009 |  even though we're still in the first 20 minutes of it,
[1162.12 - 1164.44] P:1684.07 E:0.109659 |  there's Fabian Ruiz with a ball on the halfway line.
[1165.08 - 1167.16] P:1814.04 E:0.108922 |  There is one match in League One tonight, by the way,
[1167.16 - 1170.76] P:1544.12 E:0.103001 |  Burton, nil, Wigan, nil, and Solihull, Muir's nil,
[1170.76 - 1174.84] P:1734.37 E:0.097449 |  Rochdale, nil in the National League, both 745 kick-ups.
[1174.84 - 1177.96] P:1808.90 E:0.105562 |  Tomorrow night, as I say, we'll keep you up to date with Barcelona, Inter.
[1177.96 - 1180.68] P:1796.70 E:0.099971 |  Tomorrow night, commentary on Manchester United, Chelsea,
[1180.68 - 1184.76] P:1771.11 E:0.098558 |  in the Women's Super League, and then do not miss Thursday night as well.
[1184.76 - 1188.60] P:1736.01 E:0.103725 |  Two commentaries from the Europa League for you on the Manchester United
[1188.60 - 1191.40] P:1723.63 E:0.096954 |  and Tottenham semi-finals, Manchester United on five-line,
[1191.40 - 1193.16] P:1840.36 E:0.108918 |  and Tottenham on sports extract.
[1193.72 - 1198.52] P:1789.70 E:0.096985 |  And PSG winning a free kick in their own defensive third
[1199.08 - 1203.08] P:1740.82 E:0.090917 |  and playing it back to goalkeeper Donnarumma.
[1203.64 - 1205.96] P:1642.50 E:0.097307 |  Yes, Ian Dennis, who is with you in Madrid,
[1205.96 - 1208.04] P:1715.40 E:0.093539 |  he's off to build bowel this week.
[1208.68 - 1209.96] P:1678.97 E:0.123616 |  He does see the world, doesn't he?
[1209.96 - 1211.40] P:1745.77 E:0.123610 |  He gets a ball, he does.
[1211.40 - 1214.36] P:1767.27 E:0.116824 |  As Clarec Kaliar is challenged by, Timber goes down,
[1214.36 - 1217.72] P:1718.50 E:0.108176 |  this is five yards inside the PSG hop, this time it's Audegard,
[1217.72 - 1220.84] P:1792.07 E:0.107164 |  the Arsenal captain who goes across to the referee
[1220.84 - 1222.60] P:1797.59 E:0.113813 |  with his hands in praying mode,
[1224.04 - 1227.48] P:1824.67 E:0.103416 |  and the referee's going to have a further word with the two captains here,
[1228.28 - 1232.92] P:1874.44 E:0.088871 |  probably to say to them in the old-fashioned style,
[1233.88 - 1235.40] P:1650.25 E:0.106151 |  I'll do the refereeing around here.
[1235.96 - 1237.96] P:1747.61 E:0.103440 |  Yeah, I mean, I don't think Timber does too much wrong,
[1237.96 - 1242.92] P:1728.88 E:0.090429 |  if I'm honest, he's just got to be careful not to have too much of a nibble
[1242.92 - 1246.36] P:1711.05 E:0.097468 |  with this character, because he's getting his body in the way,
[1246.44 - 1250.60] P:1685.97 E:0.084263 |  Clarec Kaliar, that it makes it impossible for Timber to win the ball,
[1250.60 - 1252.68] P:1783.50 E:0.101954 |  and he's the type of fullback that likes to go after it,
[1252.68 - 1255.00] P:1695.79 E:0.096542 |  he'll stick at it, he'll have a nibble,
[1255.00 - 1256.52] P:1661.39 E:0.096577 |  he'll keep going, he'll want to throw it away,
[1256.52 - 1258.04] P:1689.07 E:0.090225 |  he'll want to prod the ball away,
[1258.04 - 1260.76] P:1751.26 E:0.091359 |  and you're running the risk of picking up a yellow card,
[1260.76 - 1263.56] P:1763.55 E:0.094258 |  very early on in this game, he's got to be careful.
[1264.20 - 1265.88] P:1849.65 E:0.096355 |  Well, next one, he'll be booked.
[1265.88 - 1268.36] P:1758.73 E:0.097520 |  Yeah, he will, for sure, it doesn't matter what the tackle is,
[1268.36 - 1270.92] P:1725.89 E:0.092627 |  all the offence, you feel like a yellow card is coming.
[1270.92 - 1273.64] P:1769.75 E:0.105766 |  However, Arsenal do have Ben White available,
[1273.64 - 1275.48] P:1651.78 E:0.100524 |  after they both missed the Crystal Palace game,
[1275.48 - 1277.08] P:1719.20 E:0.091714 |  White and Marino last week,
[1277.08 - 1279.72] P:1647.14 E:0.099621 |  and actually the prognosis after that match didn't look too good
[1279.72 - 1281.72] P:1752.27 E:0.090560 |  for either of them for this first leg,
[1281.72 - 1286.60] P:1707.98 E:0.096369 |  but White is available as a substitute right back on the bench.
[1287.72 - 1290.92] P:1860.80 E:0.111915 |  Declan Rice, lovely ball down the right, from Rice,
[1290.92 - 1292.52] P:1756.29 E:0.088173 |  for the captain, Odegaard,
[1292.52 - 1294.92] P:1836.68 E:0.101097 |  Arsenal, Red and White shirts coming forward, here's Saka,
[1294.92 - 1296.92] P:1811.92 E:0.097359 |  not being able to get into the game yet, excellent,
[1296.92 - 1299.56] P:1691.63 E:0.109491 |  beats two men, then the challenge, comes out to Marino,
[1299.56 - 1301.72] P:1818.82 E:0.097507 |  that was tough for Odegaard, brilliant control,
[1301.72 - 1304.76] P:1830.05 E:0.101146 |  volley set across, Marquinhos is able to head it out towards the edge
[1304.76 - 1307.08] P:1708.29 E:0.112650 |  of the penalty area, Duaier got a touch there,
[1307.08 - 1309.08] P:1752.90 E:0.116751 |  and then it was whacked away,
[1309.08 - 1312.20] P:1734.83 E:0.100897 |  but the whistle had gone, free kick, Paris Saint-Germain.
[1312.92 - 1315.80] P:1816.38 E:0.105306 |  Oh, I'm not so sure what the foul was for,
[1315.80 - 1318.92] P:1784.18 E:0.094154 |  I mean, it looked to me like Martin,
[1318.92 - 1322.36] P:1770.13 E:0.099956 |  he just bumped Marquinhos and made no attempt to head the ball,
[1322.36 - 1325.80] P:1734.52 E:0.095172 |  and just bumped in midair and stopped him getting a clean header on it,
[1325.80 - 1328.60] P:1748.26 E:0.093776 |  I think the ball is going back to Donorama's box there,
[1329.48 - 1331.32] P:1705.59 E:0.100907 |  and that's the right call for me,
[1331.32 - 1334.92] P:1815.90 E:0.091892 |  I think no attempt to play the ball from Martin Ely,
[1334.92 - 1338.20] P:1675.15 E:0.108024 |  and he made the foul, and then there was a collision with Duaier and Marino,
[1338.20 - 1342.44] P:1742.02 E:0.099676 |  there was a lot going on, but PSG have started this game very well,
[1342.44 - 1346.52] P:1690.63 E:0.097650 |  not only with the ball, but any little skirmishes or loose balls,
[1346.52 - 1349.00] P:1681.81 E:0.096832 |  or having to run and shut down and scrap,
[1349.00 - 1351.32] P:1688.26 E:0.096238 |  like we know this team is good at,
[1352.12 - 1355.32] P:1588.14 E:0.096723 |  they've been right on it in that front as well.
[1355.32 - 1358.92] P:1671.48 E:0.103777 |  Well, the three tiers of the Emirates stadium
[1359.16 - 1361.96] P:1728.29 E:0.095188 |  are absolutely wrapped by this first leg,
[1361.96 - 1365.40] P:1733.84 E:0.101634 |  of this UEFA Champions League semi-final, Paris Saint-Germain,
[1366.12 - 1370.36] P:1720.16 E:0.110861 |  getting the early goal, Arsenal now trying to work their way back into the tight,
[1370.36 - 1373.96] P:1738.67 E:0.118613 |  there's Marino who scored the third goal here against Real Madrid,
[1373.96 - 1377.64] P:1864.78 E:0.107620 |  the other goal, if you like, gives it to Saka on the right-hand side,
[1377.64 - 1381.24] P:1783.07 E:0.091028 |  Saka now hopes, raised, of Arsenal fans, back to Timber,
[1381.24 - 1383.48] P:1714.56 E:0.095633 |  then back to Saka again against Nunomender,
[1383.48 - 1386.44] P:1757.36 E:0.101199 |  right footed across towards the back post, Marquinhos jumps,
[1386.44 - 1389.32] P:1762.26 E:0.101573 |  deflected to Martinelli, Martinelli very tight,
[1389.32 - 1393.40] P:1786.66 E:0.100761 |  he pulls it across, that's clear to win, it comes out for Douay,
[1393.40 - 1396.60] P:1763.55 E:0.109807 |  to pass it forward to Hakimi, and suddenly PSG are off,
[1396.60 - 1401.40] P:1826.22 E:0.116674 |  Genbele is furthest forward, but Hakimi is just possessed by Miles Lewis-Skelly,
[1401.40 - 1403.96] P:1813.37 E:0.113293 |  who is then fouled by the PSG right back,
[1403.96 - 1408.76] P:1894.53 E:0.108019 |  and that's a free kick to Arsenal, and Miles Lewis-Skelly raises the roof.
[1408.76 - 1410.92] P:1778.06 E:0.104461 |  Yeah, I mean, referee had to keep his call there,
[1410.92 - 1413.48] P:1776.01 E:0.103614 |  because there was a big cry for a yellow card, Hakimi,
[1414.20 - 1418.36] P:1781.85 E:0.112360 |  just went across the back of Lewis-Skelly as he dispossessed him brilliantly,
[1418.36 - 1423.40] P:1792.60 E:0.109572 |  and I think Lewis-Skelly in fairness, he plays for that foul completely,
[1423.40 - 1427.56] P:1834.52 E:0.098351 |  and Hakimi is just running back, and Lewis-Skelly steps right across his path,
[1427.56 - 1432.12] P:1845.28 E:0.097302 |  yes, he draws the contact, but the referee is right to keep his yellow card in his pocket,
[1432.12 - 1435.16] P:1966.46 E:0.106564 |  because it was engaged by Lewis-Skelly really,
[1435.16 - 1438.84] P:1912.60 E:0.101572 |  and I mean, there's just great match-ups going on all over the pitch,
[1438.84 - 1443.48] P:1908.08 E:0.094930 |  the physicality and speed of this game is really special.
[1443.48 - 1450.92] P:1923.65 E:0.106567 |  So no yellow card there either, just the one shown so far to Leandro Trossar,
[1450.92 - 1456.04] P:1866.20 E:0.112140 |  but the referee, he could have been tempted to show at least one or two more,
[1456.04 - 1457.56] P:1952.83 E:0.109260 |  but it's a free kick to Arsenal.
[1460.44 - 1466.04] P:1909.29 E:0.109641 |  Arsenal FC with this free kick to be taken by Odegaard,
[1467.00 - 1472.20] P:1908.59 E:0.105073 |  so the big man are up, Kiviar is there, who scored with his head against Crystal Palace at this end,
[1472.20 - 1478.36] P:1952.90 E:0.092010 |  the end to our right, last week waiting and waiting for Odegaard, little steps,
[1478.36 - 1480.60] P:2019.08 E:0.097668 |  here's the free kick, left-footed, Kiviar's head up,
[1480.60 - 1484.12] P:1990.34 E:0.097031 |  but it's straight at Donnaroma from maybe 12 yards out,
[1484.12 - 1489.72] P:1843.03 E:0.089329 |  and the big Italian goalkeeper can just hold it and gather it into his chest.
[1489.72 - 1494.28] P:1804.13 E:0.100883 |  Yeah, I mean, the free kick's deep enough that Piersci could hold a nice high line,
[1494.36 - 1497.72] P:1854.89 E:0.099669 |  so they're holding that line right on the 18-yard box line,
[1497.72 - 1500.76] P:1813.36 E:0.094049 |  which means that if they lose the header, which they did,
[1500.76 - 1504.60] P:1677.30 E:0.104573 |  there's got to be some header to beat Donnaroma from outside of the penalty spot,
[1504.60 - 1506.44] P:1731.45 E:0.110554 |  and it was just safely gathered up by him.
[1507.48 - 1511.88] P:1825.47 E:0.114879 |  Comfortable save, routine save, as Arsenal come again,
[1511.88 - 1517.64] P:1781.97 E:0.109378 |  Odegaard to Bricayo Saka, Saka back and fit now after that concern,
[1517.64 - 1523.80] P:1720.11 E:0.097287 |  you were there weren't you, at Portman Road when he received that tackle from Leif Davis,
[1523.80 - 1529.08] P:1695.01 E:0.107210 |  but came on as a substitute against Crystal Palace last Wednesday to much reliefier, I can tell you.
[1529.72 - 1530.52] P:1682.04 E:0.105419 |  Windsor throw in.
[1530.52 - 1533.80] P:1614.11 E:0.099799 |  You know, a lot of the fans were right by that side of the pitch at Portman Road,
[1533.80 - 1537.56] P:1702.70 E:0.092723 |  and there was just like a quiet shock of, oh no, Saka's out,
[1537.56 - 1541.40] P:1641.90 E:0.096039 |  but he's managed to shrug it off and get himself fit and available.
[1541.40 - 1545.08] P:1616.24 E:0.103070 |  Arsenal going all the way back to goalkeeper Ryan, 10 yards inside his own half,
[1545.08 - 1547.80] P:1662.71 E:0.089698 |  gets the ball away from Dempale,
[1547.80 - 1551.72] P:1779.13 E:0.115387 |  long pass from Martin Alley's in an offside position, and it's a free kick to PSG.
[1552.12 - 1556.92] P:1678.62 E:0.096904 |  To go back to the referee, as I mentioned, Champions League final referee last season,
[1556.92 - 1561.88] P:1562.27 E:0.097283 |  so by that definition, you know, they consider him to be either the best or one of the best,
[1561.88 - 1564.92] P:1719.73 E:0.100652 |  and you can understand why he's been appointed to this tomorrow night.
[1564.92 - 1567.16] P:1660.50 E:0.091012 |  Clive and Turpan is refereeing tomorrow night.
[1567.16 - 1569.80] P:1714.86 E:0.103818 |  Right, okay, he's made some good calls so far as well, isn't he?
[1569.80 - 1572.92] P:1763.47 E:0.107012 |  Yeah, given away by Nuno Mendes, and that means Arsenal could be in business,
[1572.92 - 1575.64] P:1696.10 E:0.108244 |  Odegaard then writes infield to Merino, a little pass through the middle,
[1575.64 - 1577.08] P:1736.26 E:0.108398 |  Odegaard just couldn't get there.
[1577.88 - 1582.76] P:1747.37 E:0.108245 |  Schuau-Nevers was able to get the crucial touch for Paris Saint-Germain,
[1582.76 - 1589.96] P:1709.35 E:0.091406 |  but Arsenal just beginning to show one or two sights of their better play, shall we say.
[1589.96 - 1592.60] P:1721.44 E:0.105825 |  But here's Hakimi, a game bursting for it.
[1592.60 - 1596.12] P:1790.98 E:0.099455 |  Hakimi up against Kivio, is able to get there first,
[1596.12 - 1597.08] P:1763.45 E:0.095504 |  giving it to Schuau-Nevers.
[1597.08 - 1599.64] P:1741.45 E:0.101881 |  Now Clare it's Kaleor again against Tim by Schutze,
[1599.64 - 1602.76] P:1848.07 E:0.100440 |  Cross took a deflection, but that took it into the path of Ryan,
[1602.76 - 1605.08] P:1802.56 E:0.106479 |  who was able to drop down onto it on his left side.
[1606.04 - 1609.48] P:1660.91 E:0.105889 |  Hakimi's had the breakfast, but he's flying up and down this pitch,
[1609.48 - 1613.88] P:1712.65 E:0.111555 |  he really is, I mean, it's tough to contain at the moment on that right-hand side.
[1614.68 - 1619.32] P:1717.10 E:0.112569 |  Moroccan international, maybe a nice Moroccan breakfast.
[1619.32 - 1619.72] P:1765.79 E:0.116305 |  Maybe.
[1619.72 - 1621.32] P:1695.96 E:0.113536 |  They do those lovely eggs, don't they?
[1621.32 - 1621.72] P:1666.87 E:0.093556 |  That's right.
[1621.72 - 1623.00] P:1509.30 E:0.104422 |  It's that Moroccan breakfast.
[1623.00 - 1624.04] P:1602.89 E:0.106956 |  That's right, yeah.
[1624.04 - 1624.68] P:1623.04 E:0.091343 |  Fold again.
[1625.56 - 1630.44] P:1738.02 E:0.109777 |  Here is Merino, Merino, now to the left-hand side to Trossard,
[1630.44 - 1633.16] P:1802.39 E:0.105590 |  Trossard with a pass to Martinelli, who's on the left wing.
[1633.16 - 1635.88] P:1837.97 E:0.096933 |  Martinelli up against Hakimi, he's got to defend now,
[1635.88 - 1637.48] P:1804.87 E:0.103536 |  then plays it back though, Lewis Scali,
[1637.48 - 1640.20] P:1891.74 E:0.107368 |  his ball into the box, Trossard is there, left side of the area,
[1640.20 - 1644.68] P:1836.66 E:0.103999 |  and then from the angle, a weak shot really that was straight at Donnaroma,
[1645.24 - 1647.48] P:1795.22 E:0.105906 |  and he was able to pat it down.
[1648.12 - 1651.24] P:1605.05 E:0.103681 |  Producer Gary hasn't come up with the answer,
[1651.24 - 1654.92] P:1672.68 E:0.101312 |  engineer Chania has Shakshuka, Gary.
[1654.92 - 1656.68] P:1620.65 E:0.101625 |  I'll let you pronounce that.
[1657.96 - 1661.56] P:1859.49 E:0.091447 |  I'm struggling enough with Karabash Kaleor, to be honest.
[1661.64 - 1663.56] P:1740.86 E:0.109522 |  I don't know if anyone else is having trouble with that one,
[1663.56 - 1665.80] P:1748.87 E:0.090262 |  but it's not rolling off the tongue.
[1667.64 - 1671.80] P:1780.64 E:0.106033 |  Well, sometimes, as Shakshuka rolls off the tongue beautifully,
[1671.80 - 1676.28] P:1722.04 E:0.101055 |  here's Shuao Neves, then to Hakimi, who's on the halfway line.
[1676.84 - 1681.48] P:1668.37 E:0.075960 |  It'll pass back to Shuao Neves,
[1682.76 - 1686.20] P:1455.19 E:0.111879 |  and then back it goes into the PSG half.
[1686.84 - 1688.20] P:1629.31 E:0.108703 |  Nearly half an hour played,
[1689.08 - 1691.88] P:1563.50 E:0.096565 |  Harrison Germain with the edge.
[1692.92 - 1696.76] P:1571.69 E:0.104405 |  Lewis Enrique, already a Champions League winner, remember,
[1696.76 - 1702.44] P:1656.19 E:0.082432 |  as a manager with Barcelona, when he had Messi and Neymar
[1702.44 - 1705.16] P:1719.61 E:0.093543 |  and Luis Suarez, that incredible front line.
[1705.16 - 1706.44] P:1652.49 E:0.087425 |  Unbelievable, that one.
[1706.44 - 1712.20] P:1590.95 E:0.100116 |  Yeah, plus everybody else as well, of course, Busquets, Iniesta.
[1712.52 - 1716.60] P:1526.14 E:0.106740 |  And trying to win it for the second time.
[1718.44 - 1722.44] P:1658.58 E:0.107725 |  He would be hailed in Paris for the rest of his life,
[1722.44 - 1724.60] P:1852.89 E:0.100259 |  if he's the one, if he's the manager,
[1724.60 - 1728.76] P:1776.30 E:0.111164 |  who's able to win this trophy finally for the Qatari ownership.
[1731.24 - 1733.96] P:1691.94 E:0.103597 |  Arsenal back in possession with Saliba, here's Declan Rice,
[1733.96 - 1735.08] P:1758.37 E:0.085203 |  deep-lying position.
[1735.08 - 1737.72] P:1788.06 E:0.099938 |  He's not had the influence yet, Declan Rice in this game.
[1738.28 - 1740.04] P:1523.15 E:0.105509 |  He can't be brilliant all the time, can he?
[1740.52 - 1745.24] P:1738.22 E:0.093014 |  As the ball is passed back by Marino to Raya.
[1745.24 - 1747.00] P:1632.20 E:0.091985 |  We talked about the absence of party.
[1747.00 - 1749.72] P:1581.01 E:0.098747 |  Do you think we're seeing that already in the match?
[1749.72 - 1751.00] P:1788.06 E:0.106037 |  Yeah, I think you see the difference
[1751.00 - 1752.68] P:1727.12 E:0.104522 |  in the balance of the midfield for sure.
[1753.32 - 1757.24] P:1775.62 E:0.092366 |  I mean, it's not ideal because it was just so well oiled
[1757.24 - 1758.52] P:1854.10 E:0.092758 |  and so well put together.
[1759.32 - 1761.56] P:1811.38 E:0.107141 |  The PSG are looking a real threat at times.
[1761.56 - 1763.88] P:1842.37 E:0.113951 |  Certainly in the wide areas, and party really just dropped over
[1763.88 - 1766.92] P:1909.96 E:0.112720 |  into the full-back position and help out in that area.
[1767.88 - 1771.40] P:1898.12 E:0.102954 |  Gronz, because Kibios pass was overhated,
[1771.40 - 1775.56] P:1849.71 E:0.101593 |  put his hands on his head there because he knew that he'd overhate it
[1775.56 - 1777.48] P:1859.27 E:0.094210 |  and it's out of play for a throwing to PSG,
[1777.48 - 1779.00] P:1715.30 E:0.098871 |  halfway inside their own half.
[1779.00 - 1783.32] P:1764.41 E:0.104667 |  Luis Enrique, a little grey in the hair, his curly hair.
[1783.32 - 1785.24] P:1685.17 E:0.101360 |  White trainers on tonight, but all in black
[1785.24 - 1788.76] P:1788.85 E:0.093331 |  and he's got a sort of zip-up, sort of blues on,
[1789.72 - 1792.60] P:1816.37 E:0.098987 |  like a light bomber jacket, isn't it, that he's wearing?
[1793.16 - 1796.36] P:1840.49 E:0.097344 |  Television cameras have shown us that Arsene Venger is here,
[1796.44 - 1799.16] P:1837.44 E:0.091480 |  he's got a bit of a pained expression on his face, Matt,
[1799.16 - 1801.72] P:1878.89 E:0.097808 |  to make sure you saw, by the number of times.
[1801.72 - 1804.12] P:1751.41 E:0.088611 |  He's seen that a few times, well actually not that often,
[1804.76 - 1808.60] P:1814.43 E:0.093785 |  but he's good to see him here, enjoying this game for sure.
[1808.60 - 1812.44] P:1698.63 E:0.095947 |  He was the manager last time Arsenal were in a Champions League semi-final
[1812.44 - 1817.80] P:1683.20 E:0.102063 |  and indeed the only time Arsenal were in a Champions League final in 2006.
[1818.92 - 1822.36] P:1459.89 E:0.104982 |  That season, the Villarreal remember in the semi-finals
[1822.36 - 1825.56] P:1642.94 E:0.103084 |  when Jens Lehmann made that penalty save from Riquelny,
[1825.56 - 1827.24] P:1563.57 E:0.098526 |  right at the end of the second leg in Spain.
[1827.96 - 1829.64] P:1749.87 E:0.116866 |  Very tight semi-final that one.
[1830.52 - 1833.96] P:1837.67 E:0.098176 |  Long and forward for PSG, but Nuno Mendes has hit that straight out of play,
[1833.96 - 1836.28] P:1678.82 E:0.090913 |  so it's a throw into Arsenal, the other halfway line.
[1836.28 - 1841.64] P:1625.96 E:0.105287 |  It is Burton, Wigan, Niel at half time in the League One match tonight.
[1842.20 - 1849.40] P:1765.58 E:0.092183 |  And Arsenal, Tim Bap is being told to go back into his own half for this throw in.
[1851.08 - 1854.04] P:1806.89 E:0.118311 |  Which he takes infield to Odegaard, who lifts it over the top of Pacho,
[1854.04 - 1857.72] P:1709.66 E:0.095449 |  but Pacho got his body in the way of Odegaard and it was played back to Donnarumma.
[1858.36 - 1863.24] P:1734.67 E:0.102875 |  Just in my eye line there, the PSG fans behind Donnarumma in the stands, so vibrant.
[1863.24 - 1866.68] P:1688.88 E:0.092854 |  They're on their feet, they're waving their arms and their flags in the air,
[1866.68 - 1868.68] P:1659.37 E:0.087828 |  giving their teams terrific support.
[1868.68 - 1871.64] P:1627.98 E:0.094872 |  This is a little case of what it'll be like in the park de France next week.
[1871.64 - 1874.28] P:1882.38 E:0.101450 |  Long pass from Vic... This is for Dembale to chase onto.
[1874.28 - 1877.96] P:1862.33 E:0.096392 |  Dembale up against Saliba, he's forced him wide, he's done well Saliba.
[1877.96 - 1879.72] P:1820.68 E:0.093374 |  Still Dembale in possession though.
[1879.72 - 1882.76] P:1716.91 E:0.093008 |  Dembale with a ball at his feet, those orange boots, clips in across,
[1882.76 - 1886.60] P:1835.36 E:0.114287 |  all the way to do it, Deleon is right foot, shoots the ball, brilliant save, Raya.
[1886.60 - 1890.20] P:1774.62 E:0.103665 |  Comes out to Kavaretz-Kelia, Kavaretz-Kelia right foot, hits the post,
[1890.20 - 1894.12] P:1693.72 E:0.111781 |  bounces out and then Arsenal scraping away, not out of play yet,
[1894.12 - 1895.88] P:1665.25 E:0.106231 |  and then the offside flag comes.
[1895.88 - 1901.08] P:1734.81 E:0.106567 |  And I think that was against Kavaretz-Kelia, so I'm not sure the goal would have stood.
[1901.08 - 1905.96] P:1705.90 E:0.101080 |  But that looked for all the world, that the Kavaretz-Kelia shot would hit the post
[1905.96 - 1908.12] P:1680.71 E:0.097679 |  and deflect into the goal, but it stayed out.
[1908.12 - 1912.44] P:1549.61 E:0.102374 |  Well that's another brilliant piece of quality of play from PSG.
[1912.44 - 1916.04] P:1694.14 E:0.097069 |  I mean they switch flank, so Dua has just come over to the left-hand side
[1916.04 - 1919.08] P:1717.45 E:0.099600 |  and Kavaretz-Kelia has gone over to the right.
[1919.08 - 1924.20] P:1700.10 E:0.100319 |  And it just threw Arsenal a little bit, I think it's the shot that came in before
[1924.20 - 1927.96] P:1660.88 E:0.099495 |  the one that came off the post, that's the offside, but the effort from Dua
[1927.96 - 1932.20] P:1570.16 E:0.106565 |  was brilliantly saved from David Ray, it really had to adjust his weight
[1932.20 - 1934.44] P:1655.58 E:0.106878 |  and get down low to his right-hand side.
[1934.44 - 1938.52] P:1600.73 E:0.104583 |  But I have to say, John, there is a big warning signs in this game
[1938.52 - 1940.28] P:1653.56 E:0.105137 |  and Arsenal can't afford to go too down.
[1941.24 - 1947.32] P:1624.40 E:0.095533 |  This front three, that actually they weren't at their best at Villapark.
[1947.32 - 1951.72] P:1692.43 E:0.108440 |  Of all of the matches we've seen recently live, that was the match in which the front three
[1951.72 - 1956.84] P:1703.27 E:0.103284 |  had least impact, but they looked mighty dangerous here tonight,
[1956.84 - 1960.60] P:1569.46 E:0.098549 |  this three with Barclay on the bench and got Salor Ramos as well.
[1960.60 - 1964.84] P:1585.93 E:0.095531 |  I mean he's done nothing wrong Barclay, to lose his place in the team.
[1964.84 - 1970.20] P:1691.46 E:0.098141 |  He's had a good season, he's been playing well, but I've just seen a couple of flashes from Dua
[1970.28 - 1973.48] P:1682.46 E:0.099859 |  over the far side and he's on this near side now because they've switched,
[1973.48 - 1975.40] P:1584.59 E:0.119016 |  he looks super bright with his feet.
[1975.40 - 1978.52] P:1726.90 E:0.099851 |  So here is now Cavarra to Kealier, who's actually central,
[1978.52 - 1982.76] P:1633.84 E:0.093668 |  he's received this ball in the centre circle but then makes his way out towards the right-hand side.
[1982.76 - 1987.64] P:1722.29 E:0.091047 |  What we don't know is whether that, if Dua had found the net with that shot that was
[1987.64 - 1991.88] P:1722.98 E:0.101432 |  really outstandingly saved by Raya, whether that would have stood.
[1991.88 - 1997.64] P:1646.49 E:0.102623 |  I think that was okay, I think it's then the one from, the one off the post that the flag went up.
[2000.20 - 2004.68] P:1671.19 E:0.101923 |  So one nil to Paris Saint-Germain, it could easily be more.
[2005.56 - 2011.32] P:1716.45 E:0.092299 |  That save there could be absolutely, it was big pivotal Arsenal hold.
[2013.00 - 2017.00] P:1624.17 E:0.104417 |  But the signs are, I have to say, if you've just switched on to us and have heard the news,
[2017.00 - 2022.04] P:1625.31 E:0.096750 |  Ousman Dembele scoring his 32nd, his 33rd goal of the season,
[2022.76 - 2027.96] P:1773.56 E:0.113093 |  it's looked more like a second PSG goal than an equaliser for Arsenal.
[2028.04 - 2032.52] P:1804.71 E:0.106473 |  Now, Martin Ali has been dispossessed by Fabian Ruiz, he's tackling back,
[2033.08 - 2037.40] P:1804.37 E:0.102196 |  illegally says the referee, fell Fabian Ruiz who went to ground near the centre spot
[2037.40 - 2040.20] P:1791.10 E:0.086180 |  and it's a free kick to the French champions.
[2040.20 - 2043.96] P:1755.54 E:0.100396 |  Yes, a shame, Martin Ali, great reaction after losing the ball but then the tackle,
[2044.60 - 2047.96] P:1876.85 E:0.090444 |  he's got to almost like hook his foot around to try and win it.
[2047.96 - 2051.08] P:1814.05 E:0.095848 |  If he'd done that, I don't think Fabian Ruiz knew he was there.
[2052.12 - 2056.28] P:1737.79 E:0.087478 |  And I'm looking at the midfield and we talked about the physicality of Arsenal
[2056.36 - 2061.88] P:1783.05 E:0.096521 |  in that area of the pitch. Well, for me at the moment it's been PSG that have got the upper hand
[2062.44 - 2066.52] P:1786.11 E:0.104685 |  in and out of possession. They've just been brilliant through the middle and then the
[2066.52 - 2070.28] P:1803.99 E:0.090977 |  front three are coming to life with the ball when they get fed.
[2070.92 - 2077.16] P:1703.66 E:0.089424 |  Matthew Ubson, Arsenal in England, defender, Champions League player, Premier League winner
[2077.16 - 2083.80] P:1758.54 E:0.083698 |  with Arsenal. During the finger years, here's Dembele on the left flank,
[2084.44 - 2090.76] P:1787.15 E:0.096170 |  Timber has had a tough night, Timber is able to win the ball this time and pass it forward.
[2090.76 - 2094.36] P:1717.90 E:0.098043 |  I think he's happy that they've had a little switch up from Duay's over his side now and
[2094.36 - 2097.40] P:1760.68 E:0.102070 |  he can try something a little bit different. I don't know which one you prefer.
[2097.40 - 2098.60] P:1784.18 E:0.086949 |  I know which one you'd prefer.
[2100.68 - 2103.64] P:1746.84 E:0.103513 |  I know what was uncomfortable was Cavarra's Celia.
[2103.64 - 2107.96] P:1804.71 E:0.108956 |  Yeah, in some ways actually it's a surprise that they've done that.
[2107.96 - 2111.08] P:1644.70 E:0.096212 |  Yeah, I mean he was really putting Timber under pressure wasn't he, now he's going to have a
[2111.08 - 2112.52] P:1561.13 E:0.091651 |  good go at Lewis Skelly.
[2112.52 - 2117.48] P:1812.35 E:0.102739 |  Cavarra's Celia swings a high pass right across the field. Well here it is now, it's Duay
[2117.48 - 2123.64] P:1817.81 E:0.095252 |  against Timber. Timber backpedaling, Saka's able to get a touch in on that arriving to help him out.
[2123.64 - 2128.28] P:1783.93 E:0.087460 |  But he couldn't get the ball away Saka, so had to give it back to Timber,
[2129.72 - 2136.04] P:1748.06 E:0.108493 |  who then passes it back to Saka, who is being fouled by Fabian Ruiz and you can hear Arsenal
[2136.04 - 2142.76] P:1700.38 E:0.098132 |  supporters on their feet, bang for a yellow card for Fabian Ruiz but it's only a free kick.
[2142.76 - 2147.40] P:1666.40 E:0.095712 |  I mean the best way to describe this game at the moment is that the two wide of the front three of
[2147.40 - 2153.32] P:1727.74 E:0.094868 |  PSG are having way more of the ball than what the two wide of Arsenal's front three are in
[2153.32 - 2159.08] P:1698.80 E:0.096584 |  Martinelli and Saka, they're not really being impactful at all in this opening 35 minutes but
[2159.80 - 2165.08] P:1769.51 E:0.103246 |  you know the two wide for PSG of that front three have just had so much of the ball and creating
[2165.08 - 2170.84] P:1861.12 E:0.104558 |  a lot of damage. One nil PSG, could easily be two, with that excellent save from Ruiz from Duay,
[2170.84 - 2175.48] P:1945.22 E:0.098186 |  but Arsenal now coming forward, they've been up against it during this first half,
[2175.48 - 2182.20] P:1852.18 E:0.102711 |  but Trossard, Miles Lewis-Skelia's there, he shields the ball and is challenged and wins a free kick.
[2182.20 - 2188.04] P:1791.33 E:0.102863 |  I mean he's one of the best at that Lewis-Skelia, he really is, he puts body between man and ball
[2188.04 - 2193.24] P:1860.88 E:0.096327 |  so well, he's very... It's little John McGinn, hasn't he? He just throws himself in there,
[2193.24 - 2197.48] P:1850.31 E:0.095132 |  and he knows that worst case scenario, if he can't twist out or wriggle out of it,
[2197.48 - 2202.60] P:1762.31 E:0.096006 |  he wins a free kick and he's done it in an area that's quite deep, it's relatively central,
[2202.60 - 2209.48] P:1862.18 E:0.097509 |  it's probably about 18-yard box wide, but a good 15 yards or so deeper, but it's still got enough
[2209.48 - 2216.20] P:1832.59 E:0.100638 |  angle for Martín Odegaard to be able to wrap his left foot around this ball and put a delivery
[2216.20 - 2222.60] P:1782.70 E:0.111366 |  into the box that is in range of scoring from with a header. What a dream season he's having,
[2222.60 - 2229.16] P:1635.20 E:0.110912 |  isn't he? Miles Lewis-Skelly, only made his debut in September, now he's in England international,
[2229.16 - 2234.12] P:1712.69 E:0.114242 |  scored on his debut, he was Tuchel's first match, playing in Champions League semi-finals,
[2235.00 - 2240.44] P:1758.73 E:0.100399 |  been part of a team that beat Real Madrid, played very very well in that as well, wins the free
[2240.44 - 2246.12] P:1883.46 E:0.093512 |  kick here, and Odegaard's going to take this dangerous position, Odegaard's delivery doesn't
[2246.12 - 2251.88] P:1695.80 E:0.096951 |  beat Kaveras-Skelia, who is the first man who is able to easily head it away, that was a waste,
[2251.88 - 2258.04] P:1785.14 E:0.087158 |  that was unlike Arsenal, long and forward from Raya, centre-circle, that's Chester down on the
[2258.04 - 2264.68] P:1781.00 E:0.110477 |  left-hand side, Marino pulls it back, all raised, challenged, challenged, vice-round there there's,
[2265.24 - 2274.04] P:1719.91 E:0.103905 |  and now Dona Roma has been involved in something, Marquinhos has fallen over, and Marino is down
[2274.04 - 2281.00] P:1650.16 E:0.107859 |  inside the six-yard box as well, the referee spotted it all, he's blown his whistle, and he's run over
[2281.32 - 2289.32] P:1742.46 E:0.095647 |  there to find out what's going on, Marino, I think maybe Marino and Marquinhos have come together.
[2289.88 - 2299.24] P:1701.15 E:0.093651 |  Wow, it's a brilliant piece of defensive midfield play, Jaunevers, I mean, he is that type of player
[2299.24 - 2305.00] P:1700.10 E:0.095154 |  that just gets about the pitch, and he's right on cue here, Marino about to pull the trigger,
[2305.00 - 2310.44] P:1599.07 E:0.094966 |  Kibir, cuts the ball back, he's six yards out, if he's not there Jaunevers, he's in the back of the
[2310.44 - 2316.84] P:1594.26 E:0.097174 |  net, and I think that Marino has just slot that home, but he gets there and he gets across fairly,
[2316.84 - 2320.92] P:1677.61 E:0.102154 |  and he wins the ball, he toes the ball away, and Marino kicks the back of his leg,
[2321.72 - 2325.88] P:1705.92 E:0.109647 |  which is where the rough and tumble came from, really ends up on the floor, Marino, and then there's
[2325.88 - 2332.84] P:1740.64 E:0.091060 |  a little bit of afters, but super play from Jaunevers, really does his job well for his team.
[2332.84 - 2336.76] P:1726.06 E:0.091818 |  That's the best we've seen from Arsenal actually. Yes, best chance by far.
[2336.76 - 2342.52] P:1541.04 E:0.100200 |  But as you say, Matt, Jaunevers has tackled, I mean that was exemplary.
[2344.12 - 2351.48] P:1789.35 E:0.107762 |  So, one 0 PSG lead, this is five live from the BBC, live from the Emirates stadium in Barney,
[2351.48 - 2357.56] P:1834.64 E:0.105350 |  north London, here's Saka, Saka with his heels on the white line, Kibir, it's Kaley has come back,
[2357.56 - 2361.72] P:1895.14 E:0.102004 |  Saka tries to go past him, Kibir puts in the challenge, Saka keeps his feet then shoots from
[2361.72 - 2369.64] P:1830.02 E:0.101549 |  the angle, it's straight at Donoroma, who for the big man goes down very sharply onto his knee
[2369.64 - 2376.28] P:1688.13 E:0.094955 |  and is able to comfortably feel the bouncing ball. They're still waiting to really get Saka
[2376.28 - 2381.08] P:1742.42 E:0.099220 |  into this game, Arsenal, I mean they've had a couple of little moments, but he's up against
[2381.80 - 2388.60] P:1765.16 E:0.096683 |  a player that's his sparkling form in Mendes, and I think that matchup at the moment is Mendes,
[2388.60 - 2391.88] P:1795.87 E:0.108193 |  he's just coping pretty well with Saka and we'll have to wait and see how that goes.
[2391.88 - 2396.44] P:1890.64 E:0.101808 |  Oh, Pacho was too casual there, Saka's went it back from him, Saka takes it back out of the
[2396.44 - 2401.00] P:1786.47 E:0.104683 |  penalty area, plays it square, Marino then Marino rolls it out to the left to Trossard,
[2401.00 - 2406.36] P:1834.67 E:0.101267 |  and PSG are now back in position, that was very casual from Pacho, Saka though still,
[2406.36 - 2412.04] P:1846.77 E:0.091231 |  centrally, Saka back to Trossard, who's got PSG players either side, oh Saka's done
[2412.04 - 2415.96] P:1749.79 E:0.110716 |  brilliantly, he's beaten two of them and then gets the ball in, oh the stretch part of Ellie
[2415.96 - 2421.40] P:1721.56 E:0.117359 |  can't get there, and the ball drifts between him and the goal, and all the way through for a goal
[2421.40 - 2427.88] P:1883.80 E:0.105331 |  kick beyond the far post. Yeah, just as I said Saka isn't influenced by the game enough, he pops up
[2427.88 - 2433.48] P:1637.98 E:0.099550 |  on the other side, I mean he gets all the way over to the left, just as the play develops, I will say.
[2433.48 - 2439.32] P:1676.14 E:0.101872 |  PSG don't off get blue shirts around the man on the ball, they really do try and suffocate
[2439.32 - 2444.44] P:1752.70 E:0.110898 |  any player that has it, but he whips a lovely ball in Saka with his left foot over the top
[2444.52 - 2449.24] P:1817.31 E:0.112787 |  of Donnarama and Martinelli at full stretch, I mean it looks like he could have done it,
[2449.24 - 2454.60] P:1783.36 E:0.107857 |  maybe a little bit better with the contact, he is at full stretch in fairness to him, but
[2454.60 - 2458.52] P:1725.75 E:0.118732 |  he tries to get his right foot on, he's got an open goal to put the ball in the back of the net,
[2458.52 - 2464.20] P:1696.68 E:0.098005 |  he just can't get the contact. Dembele with a challenge, both jumping for the ball on Declan
[2464.20 - 2471.16] P:1613.39 E:0.097617 |  Rice, that's a free kick, Luis Enrique doesn't like that decision, so one nil it is, could easily
[2471.24 - 2475.80] P:1611.94 E:0.095241 |  have had more than the one goal, but just that opener in the fourth minute from
[2475.80 - 2481.32] P:1619.89 E:0.101339 |  Booseman Dembele, shot in a post from the edge of the area created by Gavaritz Kaliar,
[2481.32 - 2488.68] P:1709.77 E:0.093843 |  well actually the move started by Dembele and finished by the French World Cup winner himself,
[2489.72 - 2496.92] P:1598.30 E:0.106350 |  who has now scored 28 goals in his last 28 appearances, that is the measure of him,
[2497.32 - 2504.36] P:1520.75 E:0.105696 |  and he is right on contention for the much talked about Ballon d'Or with a record like that.
[2505.08 - 2509.40] P:1691.43 E:0.109801 |  Raya takes this long out there, pulled across by Marino, takes a deflection which took it up in the
[2509.40 - 2516.04] P:1758.59 E:0.103334 |  air and Donnarama calmly caught it, arms stretched above his head, but the long free kick causing
[2516.04 - 2521.64] P:1709.55 E:0.098942 |  problems there. Yeah it was, it's been attacked doesn't it, any free kick around the halfway line,
[2521.64 - 2526.60] P:1721.41 E:0.096293 |  Raya is all the way up and Arsenal are taking every opportunity they can to put the ball in
[2526.60 - 2532.84] P:1755.26 E:0.101087 |  the PSG box and rightly so actually Marino does so well to keep that alive. Timber, Timber
[2532.84 - 2539.16] P:1734.66 E:0.108277 |  grappling with Gavaritz Kaliar, but legally and then ball out of play, Gavaritz Kaliar claiming that
[2539.72 - 2545.72] P:1675.58 E:0.095611 |  that should have been a PSG throw, the man who was signed from Napoli in January, which is the
[2545.72 - 2552.52] P:1698.55 E:0.098484 |  Napoli might win the league in Italy after a mini collapse from Inter, Napoli currently top of the
[2552.52 - 2557.80] P:1645.35 E:0.096477 |  table. It just seems like a weaker so Antonio Conte was explaining why it was he wasn't going to
[2557.80 - 2563.08] P:1632.34 E:0.099468 |  win the league with Napoli, now there they are at the top of the table. Here's Raya, Raya slipping
[2563.08 - 2569.32] P:1704.07 E:0.100578 |  as he plays the ball downfield, Saka chasing, Nuno Mendes, Nuno Mendes gets a hand in the back
[2569.32 - 2575.08] P:1761.00 E:0.114720 |  and then Saka wins it back, but the free kick's given, Saka's furious. Is it yellow card for that?
[2575.64 - 2581.56] P:1764.91 E:0.116373 |  Oh and the yellow card is out for Saka as well and I think that's for kicking the ball away.
[2582.68 - 2589.16] P:1716.93 E:0.105795 |  That is Kairnus. Yeah it is, it is. It's lost his cool there for Kairnus, Saka. Not often you see that,
[2590.28 - 2596.44] P:1652.02 E:0.108266 |  really don't see that very often, but the referee's pulled it back with the linesmen shall we say,
[2597.08 - 2601.40] P:1698.30 E:0.113401 |  for the foul on Mendes, who I don't think you're going to get much change out of him in terms of
[2601.40 - 2606.60] P:1747.83 E:0.113287 |  beating him for pace over the top, he's really quick, but there's a little shove from Saka and
[2606.60 - 2612.36] P:1801.72 E:0.103037 |  it really isn't a lot and I think Mendes is deciding shall I go down off for that? Can I just
[2612.44 - 2619.48] P:1751.25 E:0.091551 |  fall off the ball? He doesn't and then Saka, for me, cleanly wins the ball in the tackle,
[2620.04 - 2625.08] P:1795.81 E:0.097194 |  but it's almost brought back for the little shove which actually isn't enough to put him to ground,
[2625.08 - 2628.60] P:1664.05 E:0.097603 |  but you know when you're behind a player, you do give him a little nudge and the momentum's there,
[2628.60 - 2633.56] P:1772.39 E:0.101588 |  he does it like a foul. Arsenal have lost it, but that was excellently recovered by Marino. I
[2633.56 - 2638.92] P:1761.84 E:0.089898 |  thought Dembalo was going to be in there and Arsenal played away from the back, Tim back,
[2639.48 - 2644.28] P:1781.49 E:0.107389 |  excellent challenge from Kvarets Kalia and Kvarets Kalia now cutting in field, Timber tries to
[2644.28 - 2649.40] P:1802.95 E:0.114204 |  catch him and he does and Timber comes out with the ball and then he's fouled by Hakeemi and
[2649.40 - 2656.68] P:1807.06 E:0.113971 |  that's a free kick, it's a second and now there's the yellow card that comes for the PSG right back
[2656.68 - 2662.04] P:1730.05 E:0.098495 |  and he's the first Paris Saint-Germain player to be booked by referee Vintcourt. Yeah Arsenal need
[2662.04 - 2667.40] P:1728.59 E:0.097033 |  a little bit more of that from what what Timber just showed there, you lose the ball, you get back in,
[2667.96 - 2672.68] P:1739.37 E:0.100388 |  you muscle the player out the way, they need to show a bit more physicality for me in this game
[2672.68 - 2678.44] P:1712.19 E:0.093109 |  Arsenal, if they do it and confident enough to do it, they've got the match in that sense and Hakeemi
[2678.44 - 2682.92] P:1657.70 E:0.100217 |  had to foul him and it's his second foul of that type which is why the yellow card came out.
[2682.92 - 2688.44] P:1724.88 E:0.094277 |  But moments before that the Saka yellow card that was for kicking the ball away, it wasn't for the
[2688.44 - 2694.44] P:1760.06 E:0.095827 |  challenge on Nunomendes and a couple of points to be made there. I think I'm right in saying
[2694.44 - 2699.56] P:1790.88 E:0.095908 |  aren't I that Arsenal have had two men sent off this season receiving second yellow cards for
[2699.56 - 2708.12] P:1785.21 E:0.086490 |  kicking the ball away, rice and trussard, Manchester City and do you remember a very famous red card
[2708.12 - 2714.60] P:1814.34 E:0.108774 |  that was shown to van Persie in the Champions League for kicking the ball away. Here is Oregard in the
[2714.60 - 2721.48] P:1738.05 E:0.120127 |  centre circle and Marino is pulled over by Marquinhos, that's a free kick, now Marinho is saying to the
[2721.48 - 2727.48] P:1695.81 E:0.103165 |  referee, arm stretched forward, what about that for a yellow card, the referee keeps it in his
[2727.48 - 2733.56] P:1699.69 E:0.094969 |  pocket, free kick taken quickly, here's Saka on the right, we're in the 45th minute, we could talk
[2733.56 - 2743.32] P:1652.08 E:0.102265 |  about this first half for the entire halftime break, couldn't we? Kelly Cates is here with us,
[2743.32 - 2748.20] P:1782.31 E:0.107777 |  she will set out probably to do that, here is Miles Lewis-Gallie. Oh lovely pass,
[2748.20 - 2754.44] P:1782.90 E:0.107590 |  Martinelli is in, saved by Donnarama and then it deflects away and then there's a foul by Saka,
[2754.44 - 2762.60] P:1649.07 E:0.101407 |  one on one Martinelli and Donnarama makes the save. Well that's the moment of the game for Arsenal
[2762.60 - 2768.84] P:1752.02 E:0.095719 |  for sure and Donnarama has come up with the answer, brilliant save from him, I mean he's on his right
[2768.84 - 2776.52] P:1779.04 E:0.086071 |  foot, lovely slip pass in between Hakimi and Paco, gets it a little bit caught under his feet
[2776.52 - 2782.76] P:1750.51 E:0.091770 |  Martinelli and you're never too confident with his finishing in terms of this position, he's not
[2782.76 - 2787.80] P:1727.46 E:0.090563 |  clinical enough when you get to this level, you have to take those chances, if anything I think
[2787.80 - 2792.76] P:1817.31 E:0.092433 |  he's probably better off going high and into the near post, like throwing a bit of disguise on it
[2792.76 - 2797.56] P:1776.24 E:0.092684 |  because Donnarama's so big and is able to get his big hand on the ball as you're shaping up to go
[2797.56 - 2802.04] P:1755.80 E:0.086482 |  to the far post and then Odegard was going to pull the trigger, the ball was popping out to him but
[2802.04 - 2807.88] P:1617.04 E:0.095464 |  it just didn't make it to him, really good chance for Arsenal. Yeah in the added time, one minute
[2807.88 - 2812.36] P:1623.73 E:0.103925 |  of added time the whistle's going to go any minute now, referee Vintcich, I think he'll be pleased
[2812.36 - 2817.88] P:1513.49 E:0.115428 |  to get into his dressing room at half time, Slavko Vintcich and there is the halftime whistle
[2818.44 - 2821.96] P:1786.29 E:0.115375 |  and before he gets into his dressing room he's going to be booed off the field, I can tell you
[2821.96 - 2829.00] P:1811.74 E:0.113075 |  that much but there we are halftime Arsenal nil, Paris Saint Germain won the early goal from Dan
[2829.00 - 2834.84] P:1846.25 E:0.102862 |  Ballet but the chance right at the end of the half, Martinelli who ran away and scored in the
[2834.84 - 2840.60] P:1745.46 E:0.108949 |  Burnabout, the clinching goal didn't he, took that away beautifully but wasn't able to beat Donnarama
[2840.60 - 2846.28] P:1800.83 E:0.113961 |  here tonight. No, he just wasn't able to find the finish and it was a lovely slipped move, I just feel
[2846.28 - 2851.24] P:1862.40 E:0.108813 |  like Arsenal in the last five, ten minutes, I think they've just realised they've got to make this game
[2851.24 - 2856.60] P:1861.34 E:0.097889 |  a little bit ugly, a little bit scruffy and really make life difficult for PSG who have been very
[2856.60 - 2866.12] P:1902.69 E:0.096215 |  dominant in his first half. Yeah and it was indeed very loudly and throttily booed off the field
[2866.12 - 2873.00] P:1836.58 E:0.101317 |  so it's been a tough match to, tough match to referee Trossard and Saka, yellow carded for Arsenal
[2873.00 - 2879.80] P:1823.64 E:0.096534 |  players, Saka kicking the ball away, Hakimi with that yellow card for Paris Saint Germain so there
[2879.80 - 2885.88] P:1872.96 E:0.099399 |  we are, Arsenal nil, Paris Saint Germain won here at halftime and as I say Kelly Cates is sitting
[2885.88 - 2891.64] P:1796.91 E:0.102390 |  just along from us here. The atmosphere here at the Emirates could be described as as fevered,
[2891.64 - 2896.76] P:1788.41 E:0.086282 |  is there a sense that that's transmitting itself to the pitch do you think? Yeah maybe I think when
[2896.76 - 2902.20] P:1835.39 E:0.093877 |  the game starts like it did, I think it just sends maybe a little bit of panic and then everyone
[2902.20 - 2907.48] P:1836.82 E:0.092853 |  gets a little bit edgy and then you're right, I think the atmosphere changed a little bit and
[2907.48 - 2912.20] P:1790.28 E:0.094471 |  Arsenal have got to kind of wrestle that back, I think the way to do that is by being more dominant,
[2912.20 - 2917.00] P:1874.83 E:0.090409 |  being more physical, the way they've got to this place is by being that team that can cope
[2917.56 - 2923.72] P:1828.64 E:0.089445 |  with what PSG will throw at them and PSG have done what they do very well in the first half,
[2923.72 - 2929.16] P:1910.61 E:0.095870 |  I will say it's been a real challenge for Arsenal. And I know that the officials had a very hostile
[2929.16 - 2932.60] P:1963.28 E:0.108476 |  reception as they were making their way off the pitch, I'm not sure they've got quite as many
[2932.60 - 2938.92] P:2029.10 E:0.099962 |  decisions wrong as maybe the home crowd think but there's certainly been some European fouls
[2938.92 - 2943.56] P:1956.20 E:0.103367 |  given and not given in this one, it feels like a very much a Champions League refereeing performance.
[2943.56 - 2949.24] P:2051.02 E:0.104696 |  Yeah I'd agree with that, I think you know Saka's won the yellow card, you can't disagree with that,
[2949.24 - 2953.48] P:1982.90 E:0.094870 |  you can't kick the ball away once the foul has been given, I mean that was a blatant you know
[2955.48 - 2960.44] P:1831.88 E:0.102773 |  lack of discipline from Saka, I mean it's dissent isn't it and I don't think the referee's got too
[2960.44 - 2965.72] P:1846.91 E:0.099603 |  much, I don't think he's got the balance right, you know the penalty, Schalpen, the Georgian, I just
[2965.72 - 2972.04] P:1903.98 E:0.100378 |  feel that he's running through the players and there's a bit of contact from Lewis Skelly, so I
[2972.04 - 2976.28] P:1843.71 E:0.099342 |  think all in all the referees had a tricky game to manage but I think he's done okay.
[2976.28 - 2980.36] P:1705.04 E:0.109859 |  Yeah and Carreth's Kaleigh are causing all kinds of problems as we know he does, he's all over the
[2980.36 - 2985.24] P:1873.30 E:0.093590 |  pitch for for Paris Saint-Germain as he very often is, every time you look up he's he's somewhere
[2985.24 - 2991.08] P:1872.02 E:0.101331 |  else and it's not it's not a lack of discipline as a player, it's just freedom in that role isn't
[2991.16 - 2995.88] P:1865.82 E:0.093997 |  yeah I mean that they're switching sides he's got the freedom but they work hard as well,
[2995.88 - 3000.76] P:1893.56 E:0.096234 |  I mean they're tracking back, Arsenal getting the ball you're seeing three or four blue shirts,
[3000.76 - 3006.28] P:1877.22 E:0.094288 |  they'd like to suppress, they'd like to to to supplicate an opposition and really make life
[3006.28 - 3010.20] P:1699.13 E:0.104224 |  difficult when they've got the ball and they do that well in numbers, they've got the energy,
[3010.20 - 3015.24] P:1704.54 E:0.097297 |  they've got the legs and like I said the two wide players in the front three, yes they're working
[3015.24 - 3020.76] P:1815.59 E:0.094012 |  backwards but they've been such a threat when PSG have had the ball and Arsenal has really got a
[3020.84 - 3025.24] P:1810.32 E:0.107116 |  game on their hands. Do you think that Arsenal need to be reminded at half time that we're only a
[3025.24 - 3030.04] P:1822.37 E:0.110757 |  quarter of a way through this two-legged tie and there's only one goal in it? I think you've got
[3030.04 - 3034.52] P:1819.53 E:0.105445 |  to stay calm haven't you, I mean the early goal does indicate that and there's plenty of time
[3035.08 - 3039.64] P:1829.54 E:0.095808 |  in this tie, like you say you've got half time here then you've got another full game away from home
[3039.64 - 3044.92] P:1726.41 E:0.095439 |  there's a lot that can happen and you've got to stay in the game when the moments are bad or when
[3044.92 - 3050.28] P:1785.55 E:0.090056 |  the run is going bad you stay in the game because you know there's a lot of football to be played
[3050.28 - 3056.20] P:1861.07 E:0.103407 |  as yet. Julian LeRon is here as well, just checking whether or not you could hear and whether
[3056.20 - 3061.48] P:1843.58 E:0.100691 |  or not you could be heard more importantly and in terms of that first half performance from Paris
[3061.48 - 3067.24] P:1965.44 E:0.102701 |  Saint-Germain, do you think they've been, the word I feel I want to use is smart in that first half?
[3067.24 - 3071.16] P:1913.03 E:0.110829 |  Yeah I have to say for the first 40 minutes because the end is really an Arsenal end with
[3071.16 - 3076.04] P:1917.69 E:0.106029 |  our Martinelli chance but it's an impressive performance, I thought they were just outstanding,
[3076.60 - 3080.76] P:1973.50 E:0.109348 |  not just the goal and the goal really highlighted everything we said pretty much right, this is
[3080.76 - 3086.68] P:1946.18 E:0.109403 |  where party usually is and Rice and Marino and Rice going to double up with Timberg as far as
[3086.68 - 3090.68] P:1920.99 E:0.109702 |  Kelyard, I'm not sure he needs to go there and then Dembele is on his own where he should never be on
[3090.68 - 3094.84] P:1950.34 E:0.104112 |  his own at this level on the edge of the box like this, to see the goal again on our screen is
[3095.64 - 3100.60] P:1887.79 E:0.093396 |  terrible defending from an Arsenal point of view but I thought PSG used Dembele so well when he was
[3100.60 - 3105.64] P:1822.45 E:0.092000 |  dropping, I thought they used their workplace so well like I could hear what Matt just said
[3106.04 - 3109.80] P:1912.35 E:0.099146 |  and I think he midfield for most of that first half, Virginia and Neves and Rice were outstanding
[3109.80 - 3115.48] P:1900.57 E:0.106118 |  later. It's half time in this Champions League semi-final, first leg between Arsenal and Paris
[3115.48 - 3121.40] P:1753.31 E:0.101145 |  Saint-Germain, Paris lead by a goal to nil but we are only at the quarter point of this two-legged
[3121.40 - 3125.88] P:1827.40 E:0.097330 |  tie and there is only one goal in it, we'll be back for the second half very shortly first
[3125.88 - 3133.00] P:1538.40 E:0.110304 |  though it's time for the BBC News with Nick Hatfield. The voice of the UK. This is BBC Radio 5 Live.
[3133.00 - 3137.40] P:1539.99 E:0.120162 |  Thank you Kelly, good evening. Donald Trump says he's had a very nice phone call with the Amazon
[3137.40 - 3142.44] P:1655.74 E:0.105986 |  boss Jeff Bezos earlier the White House criticised the online retailer. Over reports it was going
[3142.44 - 3148.04] P:1746.87 E:0.091750 |  to start showing customers how much the president's tariffs added to the cost of products. Amazon says
[3148.04 - 3154.20] P:1680.89 E:0.097717 |  no plan like that was ever approved. The Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has been setting at his
[3154.20 - 3159.40] P:1601.15 E:0.107153 |  plan to respond to President Trump's tariffs and his comments about Canada becoming the 51st U.S.
[3160.28 - 3165.40] P:1664.09 E:0.097660 |  Mr Carney, whose Liberal Party has just won the federal elections, has been speaking to the BBC
[3165.40 - 3170.20] P:1513.27 E:0.109134 |  and says he'll only visit Washington when there is a serious discussion to be had.
[3170.20 - 3175.80] P:851.92 E:0.079586 |  We are the biggest client for more than 40 states. We supply them with vital energy and it
[3175.80 - 3179.40] P:942.04 E:0.100649 |  potentially could supply them with critical minerals. Remember that we supply their farmers
[3179.40 - 3184.28] P:893.46 E:0.091082 |  with basically all their fertiliser, 70% of their fertiliser and beyond. So we deserve
[3184.28 - 3188.52] P:1010.57 E:0.085385 |  respect, we expect respect and I'm sure we'll get it in due course again.
[3189.16 - 3195.48] P:1753.03 E:0.113421 |  A suspect is on the run in Sweden after three people were killed in a shooting in the city of
[3195.48 - 3201.00] P:1505.43 E:0.105286 |  Uppsala. Local media reports say several people were injured in the attack at a hair salon in
[3201.00 - 3206.92] P:1737.78 E:0.092779 |  the city centre. The attack reportedly fled on a scooter. The trial has started if two men accused
[3206.92 - 3213.56] P:1752.77 E:0.109038 |  of cutting down the famous Sycamore Gap Tree next to Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland in 2023.
[3213.56 - 3217.56] P:1741.29 E:0.111198 |  They're charged with criminal damage. Our correspondent Eunice Muller has been at Newcastle
[3217.56 - 3223.96] P:1624.90 E:0.092505 |  Crown Court. Richard Wright Casey said that after their moronic mission, that's how he described it,
[3223.96 - 3231.24] P:1404.25 E:0.097695 |  Daniel Graham from Carlisle and Adam Carruthers from Wicton in Cumbria kept a wedge of that trunk
[3231.24 - 3236.84] P:1327.77 E:0.104038 |  as a trophy. The tree itself of course was in the Northumberland National Park, the whole of this
[3236.84 - 3241.72] P:1536.99 E:0.104812 |  area is part of a UNESCO heritage site. So the trial will be looking into these factors in the
[3241.72 - 3248.60] P:1632.84 E:0.100729 |  coming days. Both men of course denied the charges. And a performance spy rapper's kneecap at the
[3248.60 - 3253.88] P:1697.71 E:0.110520 |  Eden Project in Cornwall in July has been cancelled. No official reason has been given,
[3253.88 - 3258.84] P:1599.39 E:0.105257 |  but it comes after the Belfast group apologised to the families of the murdered MPs, Sir David Amos
[3258.84 - 3264.12] P:1843.57 E:0.099818 |  and Joe Cox for a clip on social media appearing to share one of the band members telling a crowd

[3360.60 - 3365.40] P:1849.61 E:0.112108 |  to Barcelona in the semi-finals and the Champions League is the main topic on the latest Women's
[3365.40 - 3369.96] P:1890.22 E:0.103697 |  Football Weekly. That's available right now via the Football Daily podcast with Ben Haynes,
[3369.96 - 3376.44] P:1705.89 E:0.096172 |  Jen BT and Ellen White. The only way to describe it for Chelsea is embarrassing for one. And I
[3376.44 - 3381.96] P:1759.73 E:0.086961 |  think for Barcelona they soaked up all that pressure. I think they knew for the first kind of
[3381.96 - 3388.44] P:1689.61 E:0.082368 |  20-25 minutes that Chelsea were going to come at them. And I think the difference with Arsenal
[3388.44 - 3392.52] P:1642.23 E:0.093304 |  and what Chelsea did is they picked their moments Arsenal, whereas Chelsea just tried to just go for
[3392.52 - 3397.24] P:1749.48 E:0.090105 |  it. And it wasn't really, I don't think there was like a true plan in it. And then it was just
[3397.24 - 3401.88] P:1611.88 E:0.096781 |  executing everything up the top. Just wasn't there, not the right pass. The finish wasn't good
[3401.88 - 3407.00] P:1793.33 E:0.081821 |  enough. And then when you allow someone like Bonmatti just to run the length of the pitch and
[3407.00 - 3410.84] P:1720.56 E:0.100060 |  just smash it into the back of the net, I feel like you know your shoulders just go down. You just
[3410.84 - 3416.36] P:1587.80 E:0.098425 |  think this is just an even harder task than what we ever thought of. And I feel like it was just,
[3416.36 - 3420.20] P:1451.43 E:0.092290 |  it was just, it felt like a walk in a park for Barcelona from being perfectly honest. And you
[3420.20 - 3424.36] P:1585.99 E:0.092624 |  know I've been there. I've been there with Man City and we've played Barcelona away from home,
[3424.36 - 3429.96] P:1706.62 E:0.088582 |  got destroyed, 3-0. We got absolutely destroyed. We came back home and we're like this will never
[3429.96 - 3436.52] P:1701.96 E:0.084385 |  happen to us again. We are not then losing again 3-0. So we changed it and we won. But over obviously
[3436.52 - 3440.44] P:1731.12 E:0.085383 |  for the whole time we didn't go through. But we looked at each other and thought this could not
[3440.44 - 3446.28] P:1651.04 E:0.088400 |  happen again. We cannot let them come come to our home and destroy us again. We have to be smart.
[3446.28 - 3451.24] P:1646.22 E:0.096606 |  We have to press them in the right areas and we have to finish when we're given the right opportunity.
[3451.24 - 3456.28] P:1807.43 E:0.094811 |  And it just felt like it was Barcelona's to take and that they just destroyed them. I just feel
[3456.28 - 3460.52] P:1750.05 E:0.083511 |  like Chelsea were extremely naive and they looked quite tired if I'm being honest as well.
[3460.52 - 3465.48] P:1617.68 E:0.105876 |  Can I ask what did you, was it a difference in mentality or was it a different in tactics from
[3465.48 - 3470.68] P:1730.24 E:0.105060 |  that going back to the second like when you're saying you changed it? Both I would say. Mentality
[3470.68 - 3476.36] P:1541.70 E:0.097678 |  and also tactics. Slightly tweaked the personnel but then also the tactics. We sat off them a bit
[3476.36 - 3482.04] P:1542.07 E:0.090512 |  too much in that first one. They just destroyed us and we just couldn't get back into the game.
[3482.76 - 3487.72] P:1572.96 E:0.098382 |  And yeah, I think 3-0 was quite a good one to take home to be honest because it could have been a
[3487.72 - 3491.80] P:1641.15 E:0.095860 |  lot more. And then yeah, we changed personnel and tactics and we just went for them. We went
[3491.80 - 3496.68] P:1522.85 E:0.096878 |  gung-ho and they hated it. We pressed them. We were physical. We absolutely attacked them basically.
[3496.68 - 3501.24] P:1622.94 E:0.106530 |  We still obviously lost the tie. But I feel like in yourself you can still go well. We gave everything
[3501.24 - 3505.80] P:1660.15 E:0.090521 |  and we won. But I feel like you cannot go away from home and lose 4-1 and come home
[3505.80 - 3510.44] P:1743.26 E:0.101180 |  and lose 4-1 as well. It's just that's not acceptable. That was Ellen White talking on the

[3515.24 - 3519.16] P:1883.18 E:0.113967 |  On Thursday, Nottingham Forest could move to third in the Premier League if they win their game in
[3519.16 - 3525.40] P:1897.73 E:0.105103 |  hand over Brentford. Nuno Esposito Santo has been speaking today. He hasn't been shy in explaining
[3525.40 - 3529.64] P:1622.14 E:0.092333 |  the magnitude of their remaining games this season. To the end, I think the other season of the game
[3529.64 - 3535.24] P:1450.93 E:0.069826 |  is going to be very, very important for all of the teams involved in this fight. We have one
[3535.24 - 3540.44] P:1409.03 E:0.079497 |  game less. Let's try to do it well, perform well. We are back in the Cinti ground. Once again,
[3540.44 - 3545.88] P:1500.61 E:0.067240 |  in front of our fans, it's a big help for us. We never stop believing no matter what happens.
[3547.08 - 3550.68] P:1400.39 E:0.093303 |  Through the competition, we had good moments, bad moments. We've been able to react.
[3551.32 - 3557.40] P:1376.45 E:0.078103 |  And again, it's up to us to react and perform. All the games are the biggest game of our careers.
[3557.48 - 3562.84] P:1766.85 E:0.099820 |  This is how we approach it. And that was Nuno Esposito Santo. And there will be updates of Forest
[3562.84 - 3567.96] P:1908.80 E:0.102693 |  against Brentford on Five Lives Sport on Thursday. Elsewhere today, QPR have placed head coach
[3567.96 - 3572.84] P:1901.79 E:0.099348 |  Marty Sufuentes on gardening leave. So he won't take charge of their final championship game of
[3572.84 - 3578.44] P:1852.07 E:0.102736 |  the season against Sunderland. Sufuentes has been linked with the West Brom vacancy. West Ham United
[3578.44 - 3582.68] P:1881.30 E:0.100810 |  Women's Team Manager, Ian Skinner, has signed a one-year contract extension that goes to the
[3582.68 - 3588.36] P:1890.00 E:0.101834 |  summer of 2026. In tennis, Britain's Jack Draper is three to the last 16 at the Madrid Open,
[3588.36 - 3593.48] P:1870.87 E:0.103012 |  after opponent Matteo Barattini retired injured. Next, heel-faced American Tommy Paul,

[3598.92 - 3604.04] P:1833.18 E:0.097360 |  England women's head coach John Mitchell will stay on even if the Red Roses fail to win this year's
[3604.04 - 3610.28] P:1851.44 E:0.102037 |  home rugby World Cup. England, who last won the World Cup in 2014, have lost the past two finals
[3610.36 - 3615.48] P:1936.45 E:0.110204 |  to New Zealand. In rugby league, Castle for Tigers have signed half-back Chris Acton from Super League

[3631.56 - 3636.36] P:1899.67 E:0.107779 |  still in the dressing room, ready to come out for the second half here. Julianne Laurent is with us.
[3636.92 - 3641.40] P:1959.15 E:0.109606 |  Chilto, they're signed from Arsenal's point of view. They were getting into that game towards the
[3641.40 - 3647.00] P:1987.18 E:0.102664 |  end of the first half, but they were starting to maybe come to terms with the magnitude of the game.
[3647.00 - 3652.84] P:1897.99 E:0.106442 |  Yeah, I think so. And also the final PSG came planned really for the first half hour or 35 minutes,
[3652.84 - 3657.64] P:1920.22 E:0.104469 |  40 minutes. That's been so good. And I think Vittiniar, Joy Neves especially,
[3658.28 - 3662.36] P:2006.33 E:0.110578 |  started getting a bit leggy at the end of that first half. And that's when you saw a bit more
[3662.36 - 3665.88] P:2034.12 E:0.106617 |  Luis Kelly coming inside in midfield. He created that massive chance for Martin Ely,
[3665.88 - 3669.24] P:1859.48 E:0.111977 |  right at the end. And really, Martin Ely should take it, should do better. But
[3669.80 - 3673.56] P:1885.78 E:0.109884 |  and for us on that, it's keeping that same intensity. Can they do it though? And
[3673.56 - 3679.00] P:1880.92 E:0.108548 |  how will PSG start that second half and respond? Let's find out with your commentary team here at
[3679.00 - 3686.84] P:1885.95 E:0.102210 |  the Emirates, Matt Upton and John Murray. Yes, Jules, just making way off back down to speak to the world.
[3687.80 - 3695.08] P:1816.93 E:0.107904 |  And Matt Upton next to me as we watch the players sprint out of the tunnel and the Arsenal players
[3695.08 - 3699.80] P:1742.48 E:0.108416 |  going into the huddle. Why don't there's any changes at half time up with Seymour. Arsenal with
[3699.80 - 3705.72] P:1838.83 E:0.103309 |  Ryre in goal. What a super save that was from him to keep it at one nil from Douay. Timba,
[3705.72 - 3714.52] P:1818.10 E:0.103751 |  Saliba, Kipio and Luis Kelly. Then Marino, Rice and Odegaard in midfield. Saka and Martin Ely
[3714.60 - 3719.80] P:1741.03 E:0.106710 |  either side of Trossard and Paris Saint-Germain with Donorummer in goal. Big save from him right at
[3719.80 - 3726.28] P:1842.35 E:0.109453 |  the end of the half. He did it at Villa Park and he did it at Anfield. Didn't he in the previous two
[3726.28 - 3732.28] P:1820.47 E:0.111262 |  rounds Donorummer saves? Then Hakimi, Marquinhos, Pacho and Mendes at the back for Vettini with
[3732.28 - 3740.92] P:1862.38 E:0.099111 |  Juaneves and Fabian Ruiz. Douay and Cavarra Scalia with goal scorer Dembele. The one goal of the
[3740.92 - 3747.08] P:1961.02 E:0.103260 |  match so far. First time Arsenal have been behind in a match in the knockout stages of the Champions
[3747.08 - 3755.48] P:1703.35 E:0.100270 |  League this season. So they need to score obviously. Clearly. Last time Arsenal failed to score here.
[3755.48 - 3761.40] P:1684.95 E:0.097446 |  It was the last time they failed to win a match or indeed the last time they lost a match against
[3761.40 - 3769.32] P:1650.79 E:0.104947 |  West Ham in the Premier League. So Arsenal kicking off the second half here at the Emirates.
[3770.28 - 3776.68] P:1753.94 E:0.096287 |  Audegaard back to Raya. Red and white Arsenal shirts tore forward at Hammer Downfield by the
[3776.68 - 3785.80] P:1705.48 E:0.097673 |  Arsenal goalkeeper and they they win a free kick for Juaneves. It's a challenge and the Arsenal player
[3785.80 - 3792.76] P:1660.79 E:0.102820 |  who's gone to ground, who's Marino, who's gone down clutching his head and there's a yellow card for
[3792.76 - 3799.08] P:1673.18 E:0.096117 |  Juaneves. Wow. Must be a flailing arm. That's the only thing I can assume. I mean yeah that's
[3799.40 - 3806.76] P:1669.85 E:0.099857 |  that's a really poor decision from the referee in terms of the yellow card. I think Juaneves jumps,
[3806.76 - 3814.84] P:1739.68 E:0.098713 |  wins the ball. His arms there protect himself. He does catch Marino with his elbow or the side of
[3814.84 - 3820.84] P:1800.67 E:0.091989 |  his arm but that's just a challenge. That's just part of the game. He jumps, he competes well,
[3820.84 - 3828.68] P:1715.60 E:0.096463 |  he wins the ball. Can't quite understand. Certainly not the yellow card but in my book
[3829.16 - 3833.64] P:1724.60 E:0.099372 |  that's not even a foul. Arsenal fans coming back to their seats Matt so we're going to have to
[3834.36 - 3841.80] P:1733.50 E:0.111190 |  yes just get up on our feet to see what happens to the left where Rice is preparing to take this
[3841.80 - 3847.56] P:1766.15 E:0.098202 |  free kick. Arsenal players masked at the back post. So many PSG players. I think everyone is back in
[3847.56 - 3853.48] P:1762.69 E:0.100444 |  there apart from the one-man wall of Dembele. Rice to play this in. Right footed there it goes. Little
[3853.48 - 3861.96] P:1865.15 E:0.118499 |  glance it's in. Arsenal score. It's the equaliser. Arsenal surround
[3863.32 - 3872.60] P:1775.77 E:0.114899 |  Mikhail Marino who stood with his arms raised. Cleansed fist. Marino he scored against Real Madrid
[3872.60 - 3879.80] P:1755.62 E:0.110735 |  now he's scored against Paris Saint-Germain and Arsenal needed that didn't they just second minute
[3879.88 - 3886.92] P:1669.00 E:0.113285 |  of the second half. Arsenal won Paris Saint-Germain won. Big start from Arsenal to the second half.
[3886.92 - 3892.92] P:1710.74 E:0.117536 |  What a needed goal. I mean the free kick will be debated. It's very dubious but Arsenal don't care.
[3893.48 - 3901.80] P:1751.13 E:0.118320 |  It's that famous kind of line of players that all run along a line and then duck into the crowd
[3901.80 - 3908.28] P:1728.31 E:0.112488 |  and Marino's the one that just gets in front of Donorama. The PSG defenders I think it's
[3908.84 - 3915.00] P:1673.98 E:0.114070 |  Pacho in there who's the deepest one or maybe Mendez and he just can't get to the ball ahead of
[3915.00 - 3920.84] P:1701.69 E:0.109637 |  Marino. It's a really good downward glancing head up. I mean it looked a really tight offside
[3921.64 - 3928.04] P:1774.41 E:0.096219 |  and I think they're still having a good look at that referee is paused in and around the centre
[3928.04 - 3934.84] P:1745.17 E:0.097670 |  circle. The offside did look very very tight because when they run that line John they have to then
[3934.84 - 3941.40] P:1761.81 E:0.095675 |  step back on side as the delivery comes in and it looked I mean it was yeah very very tight.
[3941.40 - 3948.68] P:1808.20 E:0.091926 |  Semi-automated offside is in operation in the Champions League. We've not resumed play again.
[3948.68 - 3955.64] P:1833.10 E:0.094159 |  This looks ominous. Goal check is up on all of the screens here waiting to see if that Marino goal
[3955.64 - 3962.44] P:1791.51 E:0.094324 |  will be allowed. Still the wait goes on. The Slovenian officials the video assistant referee
[3962.44 - 3968.20] P:1901.97 E:0.105675 |  is also Slovenian like the referee Alan Borosak and they're just waiting for the decision. We're
[3968.20 - 3973.48] P:1858.71 E:0.104499 |  just about to see it again now. I mean so many players together. I'm not sure. I think there
[3973.48 - 3978.52] P:1811.34 E:0.101965 |  are so many bodies in there. I'm not sure the semi-automated offside will be able to work with
[3978.52 - 3983.32] P:1753.84 E:0.094131 |  that. It won't because they'll have to pinpoint Marino because there were certain other Arsenal
[3983.32 - 3988.84] P:1790.26 E:0.088132 |  players that were offside but they'll have to pinpoint where Marino was and like I said he's
[3988.84 - 3994.20] P:1705.99 E:0.101525 |  such a cluster of shirts that that takes a little bit of time and a little bit of figuring out and
[3994.20 - 4000.52] P:1844.06 E:0.097275 |  sometimes they can't even actually get that point that final point of the body that would be offside
[4000.52 - 4006.84] P:1754.79 E:0.113242 |  because as we know camera angles can get blocked which is why the semi-automated is so important.
[4006.84 - 4012.52] P:1760.39 E:0.103517 |  There are probably we need to see it again but I'm thinking you might have to be looking at maybe
[4012.52 - 4021.32] P:1765.03 E:0.094599 |  six different bodies there. Yeah. To check which part is is beyond the line. It may work in
[4021.32 - 4025.24] P:1884.29 E:0.097248 |  Arsenal's favour in the sense that if it's inconclusive they'll just go with the on field decision.
[4026.52 - 4033.96] P:1792.36 E:0.102347 |  So the referee is walking back now and it's going to be ruled out. It's ruled out so tight,
[4033.96 - 4043.96] P:1717.15 E:0.098679 |  so very very tight and the video assistant referee has ruled that it was offside so the Marino
[4043.96 - 4050.36] P:1680.89 E:0.094903 |  goal is ruled out and it remains Arsenal nil Paris Saint-Germain won. It had that feel about it didn't it?
[4051.00 - 4059.00] P:1702.55 E:0.093033 |  It really did. I mean when you step back in from a cluster of players I mean when you look at it on
[4059.00 - 4065.16] P:1769.26 E:0.092768 |  semi-automated which is being shown on the screen he looks well offside actually like comfortably.
[4065.16 - 4070.20] P:1717.06 E:0.096441 |  It wasn't even that tight but I think just the massive bodies made it tough to figure out.
[4071.16 - 4076.28] P:1750.62 E:0.104691 |  That punctured the atmosphere almost like the Paris Saint-Germain goal in the fourth minute of the
[4076.28 - 4084.52] P:1778.55 E:0.094958 |  first half did and it goes back to one nil Paris Saint-Germain so tight and it was a set piece
[4084.52 - 4091.56] P:1775.80 E:0.090335 |  that brought the inverted commas goal. Rice's free kick as well. Yeah he definitely feels
[4091.56 - 4097.00] P:1862.56 E:0.096862 |  his Arsenal's best play isn't it to put Paris under pressure with the set plays. He's just
[4097.56 - 4102.44] P:1811.20 E:0.104999 |  earning the opportunities to get enough set plays to really make them count. And also the other thing
[4102.44 - 4106.76] P:1752.50 E:0.098686 |  as we discussed before the match, an occasion there from a set piece where Donorumma was
[4106.76 - 4113.96] P:1743.35 E:0.093430 |  unconvincing, didn't come, stayed where he was. No it's difficult and I think Marconios was making
[4113.96 - 4118.28] P:1705.67 E:0.102832 |  that point to the referee to say there's players here they shove them in the referees I saw him
[4118.28 - 4123.08] P:1693.85 E:0.093603 |  just say look it's not my problem this is their set play he's offside on this occasion but they're
[4123.08 - 4128.20] P:1804.77 E:0.096470 |  okay to start offside in the line work their way in and then just duck back in offside onside at the
[4128.20 - 4134.20] P:1809.78 E:0.094663 |  last minute it's just hard for Arsenal to time that perfectly and that time it was it was a fraction
[4134.20 - 4139.48] P:1750.41 E:0.090925 |  out but this set that set players work pretty well and Reyes now banging another one into the box.
[4139.48 - 4143.08] P:1783.16 E:0.103584 |  Yeah here's another long one downfield from the halfway line headed across the box.
[4143.16 - 4148.68] P:1830.34 E:0.098512 |  Marino gets his head to that tross hard shoots that's blocked crowd of bodies and Kivio is going
[4148.68 - 4154.04] P:1769.01 E:0.100924 |  to have a goal that's deflected down into the box and Marconios was there the PSG captain who was able
[4154.04 - 4159.56] P:1818.31 E:0.094462 |  to to whack it away with his left foot and eventually it's defected out of play over on the
[4159.56 - 4165.96] P:1669.39 E:0.098433 |  far side for throwing to Paris Saint-Germain so one nil in the semifinal this is Arsenal's second
[4165.96 - 4172.92] P:1738.52 E:0.098312 |  semifinal of this season. You remember they lost both legs to Newcastle without scoring a goal
[4172.92 - 4178.12] P:1846.90 E:0.100810 |  in the Carabao Cup lost two nil here and two nilots and James as part and actually
[4178.76 - 4187.16] P:1818.34 E:0.093303 |  Michela Tete's record he's lost all three two-legged semifinals as the Arsenal manager
[4187.16 - 4193.56] P:1750.47 E:0.097849 |  they're not scored in their last five semifinal matches. I thought that had been broken there.
[4194.12 - 4199.56] P:1781.57 E:0.101899 |  Back to back negative stats on the outside. Yeah sorry about that. Well the stats the stats John
[4199.56 - 4205.64] P:1767.23 E:0.090893 |  you're just delivering them but they're they're not great are they and this this tie I mean it's
[4205.64 - 4211.80] P:1736.75 E:0.096494 |  a fascinating tie but if Arsenal managed to turn this around or just hang on to this situation
[4211.80 - 4218.28] P:1606.36 E:0.099666 |  and even take a one nil out to Paris and leave it well in the balance I think the way this game
[4218.28 - 4225.32] P:1727.84 E:0.097910 |  has gone it's been a tricky one for Arsenal so far. It has one nil to PSG. It has won a semifinal
[4225.88 - 4230.36] P:1720.89 E:0.095648 |  in his first one but he must have to get to the FA Cup final which he won so there we are
[4230.36 - 4234.76] P:1775.82 E:0.104249 |  there's a positive there you go. Not all doom and gloom. No not all no far from it.
[4235.88 - 4243.88] P:1729.64 E:0.098185 |  Latest scores Burton won Wigan nil and Solihull nil Rochdale won in the national league.
[4244.92 - 4249.80] P:1630.29 E:0.100487 |  One nil Paris Saint-Germain here here is Douay putting in from the right hand side
[4249.80 - 4255.64] P:1699.95 E:0.097688 |  Barcala on the bench for PSG I guess we'll probably see him at some stage usually Douay
[4255.64 - 4260.20] P:1835.76 E:0.099834 |  Douay still going weaving his way and then finally Arsenal get a touch on that
[4260.76 - 4265.56] P:1823.11 E:0.109022 |  Vodegaard but it's won back from Vodegaard's round nevers and then in steps Marino crucially
[4265.56 - 4270.12] P:1734.87 E:0.099718 |  and sets right away but Rash passes it behind Trossard and Trossard remember Arsenal without
[4270.12 - 4275.08] P:1684.52 E:0.112734 |  the suspended party and then that pass from Trossard is on Grace. It's not as much of the ball
[4275.08 - 4279.32] P:1756.18 E:0.115749 |  Trossard in this game at all as he you know he's playing that centre forward role but he's not been
[4279.32 - 4286.68] P:1713.64 E:0.098048 |  too heavily involved he's been very deep at times you know I think that that lack of Thomas Parthay
[4286.68 - 4291.64] P:1578.02 E:0.099831 |  I know we touched on it in the build-up to the game but it's certainly had an impact on the
[4291.64 - 4299.80] P:1702.25 E:0.096977 |  arson team. This is BBC Radio 5 Live live from the Emirates dry spring night PSG leading narrowly

[4345.56 - 4351.64] P:1772.71 E:0.103369 |  on 5 live. Here is Dembele now near the edge of the Arsenal box work through by Douay Kivyoputs
[4351.64 - 4357.64] P:1804.65 E:0.107707 |  his body in the way of Hikini and Raya is able to come out and collect the bouncing ball untroubled
[4358.36 - 4363.40] P:1583.55 E:0.104719 |  a little shuffle from him to the edge of the area and when they're with those enormous white gloves
[4363.96 - 4370.84] P:1566.69 E:0.108809 |  the Spanish goalkeeper underarms the ball out and Arsenal come back to Declan Rice
[4371.56 - 4377.80] P:1701.22 E:0.112604 |  and Rice moves away from Dembele and now Rice running from deep holds off Douay and then finds
[4377.80 - 4385.00] P:1838.61 E:0.107386 |  the pass to Trossard and Trossard's into the box and Trossard sees his shot saved by Donnarumma
[4385.00 - 4391.16] P:1813.86 E:0.106066 |  brilliantly fingertips down to his left hand side a touch and it was past the post corner
[4392.12 - 4399.24] P:1567.80 E:0.108717 |  what a save I mean I think that is just about nestling maybe off the post and in or in that
[4399.24 - 4404.20] P:1531.22 E:0.105273 |  bottom corner that is a brilliant save but let's just talk about Declan Rice in that move that's
[4404.20 - 4411.00] P:1615.92 E:0.115685 |  the first time we've seen him really open his legs drive past three or four plays fantastic
[4411.00 - 4415.96] P:1537.42 E:0.118138 |  midfield play slip Trossard in and he's hitting the target there Trossard with his left foot it's
[4415.96 - 4421.72] P:1634.90 E:0.102831 |  not a bad finish it's just a world-class save from Donnarumma brilliant piece of play all round
[4421.72 - 4429.48] P:1743.26 E:0.093433 |  he has the scourge of the English clubs Donnarumma corner then Arsenal Saka to take it another set
[4429.48 - 4436.92] P:1590.60 E:0.090483 |  piece chance so Salivas at the back post Kivir is near the penalty spot here it is it's a very
[4436.92 - 4440.92] P:1864.57 E:0.099367 |  deep one which is headed across by Trossard Marquinhos stretching got his head to it for
[4440.92 - 4446.92] P:1690.04 E:0.106883 |  PSG ball still in the area and then it's cleared away by Dutinha downfield and the referee has
[4446.92 - 4451.80] P:1747.00 E:0.104946 |  brought it all the way back because the long he was waiting to see if the long pass would find
[4451.80 - 4457.80] P:1629.95 E:0.098561 |  Dempeli it didn't and he's brought it back for an infringement which just didn't see what that
[4457.80 - 4464.28] P:1792.76 E:0.097399 |  infringement was at all I mean players competing for the ball there might have been a bit a little
[4464.28 - 4469.48] P:1731.08 E:0.098535 |  bit of contact but that just seems a very kind of cheap free kick of anything I think that
[4470.20 - 4474.60] P:1753.89 E:0.099684 |  Kivir actually wins the ball in the tackle from Douay I'm just looking at the replay
[4474.60 - 4483.88] P:1601.31 E:0.101962 |  it's a decent tackle from Kivir he wins the ball Donnarumma hits this downfield flicked on and it's
[4483.88 - 4491.80] P:1743.24 E:0.098102 |  cleared away towards the halfway line by Saliba so we've got just over half an hour of this first
[4491.80 - 4498.04] P:1725.99 E:0.100730 |  leg to play but PSG still one nil up that right there from Declan Rice-John is exactly what we're
[4498.04 - 4502.68] P:1765.45 E:0.110494 |  talking about in terms of that physicality that Arsenal need to show in this game and start to
[4502.68 - 4508.28] P:1751.04 E:0.108424 |  really dominate but now here's Timber pushing quite up and gives it to Saka on the edge of the area
[4508.28 - 4513.56] P:1725.71 E:0.105308 |  challenge from Dron Neves on him and Saka went down nil free kick Arsenal have got it back
[4513.56 - 4520.12] P:1606.16 E:0.114834 |  Audegarde tries to slip it through the middle of the two defenders but Martinelli unable to
[4520.12 - 4525.16] P:1648.74 E:0.104032 |  to reach that it was over hit by Audegarde and Donnarumma has got the ball safely
[4525.16 - 4532.04] P:1521.97 E:0.101032 |  to Paris Saint-Germain again admittedly when we've seen him you know there's been there has been
[4532.04 - 4538.84] P:1640.50 E:0.100991 |  the occasional shaky less convincing moment or two from Donnarumma but some of the saves that he's
[4538.84 - 4543.56] P:1686.34 E:0.106969 |  made in the Champions League matches against the English clubs this season and as I say notably
[4544.44 - 4549.64] P:1680.93 E:0.111092 |  at Villa Park in the previous round long pass called forward by Kivir Martinelli trying to run
[4549.64 - 4553.88] P:1647.38 E:0.109239 |  onto this Marquinhos gets their first passes in backer Donnarumma who very nearly got the ball
[4553.88 - 4559.56] P:1672.78 E:0.116284 |  caught up and underneath his feet Dron Neves has now mis-kicked it, mis-controlled it but he's able
[4559.56 - 4564.36] P:1620.27 E:0.108134 |  to turn and pass it up the line and Gouet takes that ball down brilliant flick said pass Lewis
[4564.36 - 4570.28] P:1642.00 E:0.115830 |  Skellian and pulls Lewis Skellie back and that's a great thing to Arsenal. There is a shift in this
[4570.28 - 4576.68] P:1586.22 E:0.113635 |  game it's happening Arsenal have come out in the second half and realised that they need to be
[4576.68 - 4581.32] P:1580.61 E:0.106996 |  more confident they need to be more dominant they need to be more physical and there've been all
[4581.32 - 4589.48] P:1667.34 E:0.097504 |  those things. Well like Villa work? Absolutely and just not kind of play within yourself as the team
[4589.48 - 4594.92] P:1538.97 E:0.106633 |  and I think there was a little element of that in the first half because the start from PSG was so
[4594.92 - 4600.04] P:1529.20 E:0.107374 |  strong but they've come back out in the second half and they're really now starting to make life
[4600.04 - 4608.60] P:1594.53 E:0.096645 |  difficult for PSG which is what you'd expect. Yeah one nil at the moment that in itself would be a
[4609.56 - 4616.44] P:1629.20 E:0.099829 |  huge score line to have to overturn in the part de France next week. Here's Timberville for Arsenal
[4616.44 - 4620.60] P:1693.10 E:0.098109 |  Timbersport little it takes a deflection as it is clipped across the box but that took it out of
[4620.60 - 4625.56] P:1684.29 E:0.108171 |  the penalty area and now PSG are interested in the counter attack. Hakimi's pass forward Lewis
[4625.56 - 4630.92] P:1766.02 E:0.101278 |  Skellie it's Lewis Skellie against Dua the 19 year old against the 18 year old excellent little
[4630.92 - 4635.48] P:1641.76 E:0.114640 |  contest that we might be watching that for years to come. He does this little thing Lewis Skellie
[4635.72 - 4638.44] P:1622.36 E:0.109521 |  just grabs the player and pulls him towards it might just kind of
[4639.16 - 4645.48] P:1710.57 E:0.110330 |  clamps onto them sometimes. Muno Mendes, PSG trying to play it out from the back which they do
[4645.48 - 4652.12] P:1669.00 E:0.106456 |  effectively to Dembele who runs into Trossard but Dráun Neves receives it from him and now here is
[4653.08 - 4663.40] P:1644.00 E:0.101416 |  Atraf Hakimi the Moroccan right back, Viquinha then to Dembele 25 yards out Dembele into the box
[4663.48 - 4670.60] P:1844.44 E:0.110933 |  little ball excellent sliding tackle by Saliba very very good indeed and Hakimi who is furthest
[4670.60 - 4676.44] P:1678.15 E:0.108268 |  forward but a super tackle from Saliba in his own penalty area Arsenal come forward again
[4676.44 - 4683.00] P:1756.30 E:0.103165 |  Marino's ball deflects to Trossard just in front of Lewis Enrique and Nicolà Teta and Nicolà Teta
[4683.00 - 4690.76] P:1602.92 E:0.100831 |  picks the ball up then Trossard's down suggesting that Dua pushed him over. It's a little trick
[4691.40 - 4697.88] P:1679.77 E:0.098253 |  tiny little kind of trip that just happened when the tackle came in the ball went out and I think
[4697.88 - 4703.00] P:1671.10 E:0.092382 |  there was just a little something but this is a game now John this really has changed in the
[4703.00 - 4707.72] P:1534.58 E:0.108923 |  second half it's ramped up a little bit. Has it got a little bit of the air of the field of the
[4707.72 - 4716.44] P:1676.53 E:0.106395 |  second half against Real Madrid? It has it's just got the crowd the belief the physicality Arsenal
[4716.44 - 4721.32] P:1594.25 E:0.090312 |  applying with it just seemed a bit more confident in the second half. Arsenal take this throw in
[4721.32 - 4730.68] P:1698.12 E:0.093608 |  the halfway line back to Kivillor in for the injured Gabrielle don't forget and there's no Havertz
[4731.72 - 4737.48] P:1696.27 E:0.105951 |  no Gabrielle no Giorginho either so as well as Pate they haven't got Giorginho to call on
[4738.28 - 4746.20] P:1640.73 E:0.098579 |  and Califiore's out of this as well so it's quite a lengthy Arsenal injured list and PSG are pretty
[4746.28 - 4751.24] P:1694.18 E:0.110728 |  all healthy hasn't it? The only slight worry they had was over Dua but he's out now and here he is
[4751.24 - 4756.52] P:1783.17 E:0.105825 |  excellent again beats two men then in comes the challenge final challenge from Marino that's a
[4756.52 - 4763.96] P:1724.47 E:0.104735 |  foul I mean his feet are so quick can't they Dua? When he gets going he is tough to stop it's like
[4764.84 - 4771.64] P:1712.97 E:0.100864 |  just jinky light feet small little touches of the turf and he's bang his up and his off and he
[4771.64 - 4777.16] P:1565.24 E:0.098771 |  just gets to the ball first Marino makes the final tackle I mean there's a step over there's a
[4777.16 - 4781.56] P:1736.60 E:0.100025 |  roll of the ball under his foot and Marino just just hoops him up in the air and then gets up
[4781.56 - 4786.04] P:1625.73 E:0.092977 |  and knocks him over and I don't mind that that's the mode that Arsenal are in it's like you know
[4786.04 - 4791.96] P:1729.39 E:0.105177 |  you're on our patch you're going to come to our stadium life's not going to be easy for you. For PSG
[4791.96 - 4798.76] P:1788.88 E:0.108050 |  Clare Tuglia, Saliva comes he leans into Clare Tuglia who goes down but as he tried to work the ball
[4798.76 - 4804.36] P:1766.79 E:0.102932 |  away on the ground he actually passed it to Arsenal who break forward here's Tossar
[4805.40 - 4812.36] P:1844.89 E:0.098783 |  Passing it back to Lewis Skelly now the Polish international Kivio which gets there first but
[4812.36 - 4817.32] P:1867.07 E:0.103473 |  given away oh and Dempeli if he'd been able to receive that ball passed forward by Marquinhos
[4817.32 - 4822.12] P:1775.75 E:0.103674 |  just beyond them and through to Raya. Yeah just slightly loose ball from Kivio who overran it
[4822.12 - 4827.80] P:1713.61 E:0.099005 |  but the speed in which Marquinhos saw that and just tried to capitalise on what really is a
[4827.80 - 4833.96] P:1629.45 E:0.094744 |  minor error but he really nearly made Kivio pay for that. Near the Arsenal you near the PSG
[4833.96 - 4839.48] P:1520.45 E:0.104751 |  supporters who are singing in unison in one corner jumping up and down it's like a it's like a mini
[4839.48 - 4845.40] P:1658.37 E:0.098903 |  part de France over there that corner of the Emirates right now one nil to PSG.
[4847.08 - 4852.44] P:1773.28 E:0.116701 |  Marino through to Tossar who just gets there and kicks it back past Marquinhos turns again
[4852.44 - 4857.40] P:1670.87 E:0.110652 |  he's under pressure now from Fabian Ruiz as the Arsenal number 19 but he's done well Marino
[4858.20 - 4863.32] P:1754.33 E:0.103267 |  now here is Declan Rice. Rice thought about the forward pass goes square to Timber and the
[4863.32 - 4869.24] P:1653.14 E:0.097684 |  Dutchman Jury and Timber finds the Norwegian, Audegarde then back from Timber here is Saka
[4869.24 - 4874.60] P:1642.38 E:0.100150 |  Saka right out there on the right wing against Nero Mendes. Audegarde is able to receive it from him
[4874.60 - 4878.76] P:1893.35 E:0.094096 |  Audegarde's ball along the edge of the penalty area. Tossar trying to turn in the D plays it
[4878.76 - 4885.56] P:1684.86 E:0.101289 |  back out to Marino it's very congested in there and Marino's pass hits Joao Neves and PSG have
[4885.56 - 4890.44] P:1576.34 E:0.109906 |  got it back on the edge of their area promising again from Arsenal there promising however PSG
[4890.44 - 4897.56] P:1652.20 E:0.100651 |  break forward again there's a PSG player down Douay but PSG are just keeping an eye on him and
[4897.56 - 4902.92] P:1591.69 E:0.105538 |  Dempelet I think was thinking about putting the ball out of play but he's but he's knocked him
[4903.64 - 4907.48] P:1589.42 E:0.113811 |  and he's now back in action and he runs the ball across the field and here is Douay who's got to
[4907.48 - 4913.48] P:1578.28 E:0.093186 |  his feet and is involved in this attack but the momentum of it has now gone completely and PSG
[4913.48 - 4921.32] P:1740.50 E:0.098400 |  have to go back towards the halfway line 25 minutes of this first leg to go still just the one
[4921.32 - 4930.52] P:1616.41 E:0.109750 |  very early goal scored by Dempelet the home supporters try to do their bitch again
[4932.20 - 4938.60] P:1701.88 E:0.101568 |  Hakimian, Joao Neves so effective little Joao Neves isn't he another of the youngsters 20 years old
[4939.24 - 4945.96] P:1832.68 E:0.091897 |  he's made two interception tackles that have just been right at the right at the perfect time to
[4945.96 - 4951.08] P:1794.90 E:0.098805 |  stop a goal that's how important it's been for PSG I mean he's here there and everywhere doing all
[4951.08 - 4956.60] P:1792.98 E:0.093542 |  the ugly work picking the ball up pressing never stops running but he's made two challenges that
[4956.60 - 4964.60] P:1694.26 E:0.091873 |  have just been crucial yeah number 87 he was superb remember when you and I saw him in the
[4964.60 - 4970.44] P:1575.35 E:0.095342 |  win against Matt just with me yes he was right scored one of the goals yeah here is Vitigna
[4970.44 - 4973.80] P:1577.11 E:0.105696 |  dragging the ball back and playing it to the edge of the area I think I said that night
[4973.80 - 4979.96] P:1549.75 E:0.101395 |  Joao Neves has got the build of Verratti hasn't he yes the former PSG midfielder the Italian
[4979.96 - 4986.76] P:1440.52 E:0.098520 |  international he's solidly built ball is with Pacho in his own penalty area he has Nunomendes
[4986.76 - 4993.00] P:1765.21 E:0.106362 |  Nunomendes, Joao Neves then passes it straight out of play and the time on its style he's
[4993.00 - 4998.28] P:1497.40 E:0.103365 |  lavished in with praise and he passes it straight out for a throw. Well he's under pressure
[4998.28 - 5003.32] P:1567.64 E:0.094091 |  and that's been the difference Arsenal have got closer there's more pressure Rice,
[5003.32 - 5007.80] P:1668.20 E:0.101645 |  Merino, Odegaard they're just getting after that midfield three and they're finding it hard at the
[5007.80 - 5013.00] P:1686.37 E:0.094043 |  moment PSG to get a hold of the ball have any consistent possession and Arsenal really trying
[5013.00 - 5021.96] P:1534.76 E:0.091650 |  to apply the pressure. From here Mechalatata would absolutely take one-one to take to Paris next week
[5023.72 - 5028.04] P:1642.15 E:0.112834 |  as it is they're one nil down, thought that they'd got the equaliser early in the second half
[5028.04 - 5033.96] P:1854.11 E:0.103762 |  so that was ruled out for offside. Raya long long pass to Saka then to Odegaard little bit of space
[5033.96 - 5040.60] P:1783.60 E:0.089685 |  for the Arsenal captain goes round Pacho then across to Merino his cross in that comes off a PSG
[5040.60 - 5045.64] P:1651.47 E:0.098374 |  head which takes it out towards the right hand side timber racing with Cavarra's Kehlia and it
[5045.64 - 5049.40] P:1782.00 E:0.103577 |  is the the Georgian who gets there first knocks it up and bullies it away but actually
[5050.04 - 5056.04] P:1780.80 E:0.100280 |  he's it straight out of play for a three to Arsenal down in that far corner opposite side of the field
[5056.04 - 5062.12] P:1708.03 E:0.095454 |  to our left Arsenal take the throw back towards the halfway line Declan Rice seven goals this
[5062.12 - 5066.60] P:1668.80 E:0.101503 |  season four of them in the Champions League Merino allows the ball to run through his legs
[5066.60 - 5071.08] P:1816.76 E:0.107576 |  he was expecting I think Miles Lewis-Skelly to be there behind him but Lewis-Skelly was closer
[5071.08 - 5076.52] P:1671.35 E:0.097439 |  to the halfway line so Arsenal did well actually Martin Alley to keep it in play. When Declan Rice
[5076.60 - 5083.00] P:1697.76 E:0.093168 |  decides to run past someone it's it's happening he just knocks it opens up his stride he's got so
[5083.00 - 5088.44] P:1764.60 E:0.102003 |  much power through his legs that he just drives past people in midfield. Well that's exactly what
[5088.44 - 5094.20] P:1740.29 E:0.094418 |  Miles Lewis-Skelly is doing now through the middle gives it to Saka Saka edge of the box couldn't
[5094.76 - 5101.56] P:1665.14 E:0.088885 |  attempt the pass well attempted the pass wasn't able to execute it and PSG were able to say thank
[5101.56 - 5107.72] P:1792.41 E:0.087668 |  you very much and take it away to the halfway line well we've not had a single substitution yet
[5107.72 - 5113.56] P:1562.11 E:0.100068 |  and we are now into the final quarter of this first leg but I think that's probably what Lewis
[5113.56 - 5122.44] P:1612.23 E:0.095296 |  Enrique is thinking about and he's watching Dan Bele here go away from Kivio down the right hand
[5122.44 - 5128.12] P:1632.99 E:0.089694 |  side but Arsenal quickly back in position and Hakimi was there to play back to Marquinhos near
[5128.12 - 5132.28] P:1806.65 E:0.098872 |  the halfway line. You know it's a good game and the time just flows and then you just only
[5132.28 - 5137.64] P:1624.90 E:0.122487 |  seen like a minute ago that half time started and you look at the clock now and go wow with this way
[5137.64 - 5143.24] P:1687.74 E:0.111065 |  Farin may only be just over 20 minutes left I mean it's such a enthralling game and I can see why
[5143.24 - 5149.56] P:1714.68 E:0.105901 |  there's been no substitutions because it's just been a flowing matchup a football hasn't it and it
[5149.56 - 5154.52] P:1724.49 E:0.096411 |  must start to be on the coach's minds now to think right okay with this Farin how can we impact the
[5154.52 - 5159.64] P:1792.80 E:0.098175 |  game how can we change the game and I think Lewis Enrique is very close to making a change.
[5159.64 - 5164.52] P:1693.29 E:0.103367 |  Nicolateta was running up and down the side of the pitch there urging his team to press. I think
[5164.52 - 5169.80] P:1724.83 E:0.103970 |  somebody's just been sent up the PSG line there to have a word with is that Barcola. Yeah Barcola yeah
[5170.76 - 5176.28] P:1776.02 E:0.111607 |  and here comes Arteta again sprints forward almost sprints onto the pitch he did used to play for
[5176.28 - 5182.92] P:1805.14 E:0.093705 |  both of these teams. He had his debut on loan for the PSG from Barcelona he was talking he was a
[5182.92 - 5189.00] P:1593.87 E:0.109243 |  teenager at the time was talking so fondly about that yesterday Dembele has just sat down and the
[5189.00 - 5195.80] P:1633.50 E:0.115560 |  referee says that he will add time on Nicolateta is furious he can't understand why the referee stopped
[5195.80 - 5200.12] P:1590.21 E:0.109597 |  play clearly Arsenal players are saying for the referee but he's again pointing to his watch the
[5200.12 - 5207.08] P:1678.34 E:0.106057 |  referee slaps up in chitch and saying to to the Arsenal players the time will be added on. Yeah I
[5207.08 - 5211.24] P:1593.66 E:0.099480 |  get that it's not about the time being added on though is it it's about the flow and the rhythm
[5211.32 - 5217.88] P:1590.12 E:0.090894 |  of the game and Dembele's back up on his feet walking around now no problem doesn't need to stop
[5217.88 - 5222.20] P:1580.25 E:0.099121 |  the play for him you can sit on the floor and your team can have 10 men or you can get up and play
[5222.20 - 5227.00] P:1643.13 E:0.107309 |  the game that should be the message from the referee not you can sit down and I'll stop the game
[5227.00 - 5233.00] P:1702.91 E:0.113409 |  for you because he's up on his feet and he's okay so players are taking an opportunity to
[5233.72 - 5239.48] P:1641.49 E:0.104172 |  bring the water bottles on high live sport will be on air tonight till 10 30 so Julianne LaRonde
[5239.48 - 5245.08] P:1384.63 E:0.114446 |  will join us again I've just spotted that that Rory Smith is just sitting just to the right of
[5245.80 - 5255.00] P:1513.85 E:0.099816 |  Kelly so Rory Smith with Monday nightclub fame Dembele is substituted so Bradley Barclay is on
[5255.00 - 5262.28] P:1514.49 E:0.102719 |  for Dembele. Yes is it? Douay will now yeah looks like Douay is slipping inside into the
[5263.24 - 5269.40] P:1581.03 E:0.101069 |  central position to occupy the role that Dembele had and Barclay is on the right hand side
[5270.68 - 5278.04] P:1622.06 E:0.096742 |  Kavarashkelia on the left hand side who has been much quieter in this second up and that's a good
[5278.04 - 5282.68] P:1663.53 E:0.095020 |  indicator that Arsenal have been a different animal since the break because they've kept the
[5282.68 - 5289.08] P:1721.39 E:0.096079 |  wide plays much much quieter they've had a lot more defensive work to do PSG. Barclay started on the
[5289.56 - 5296.52] P:1620.36 E:0.108755 |  on the right hand side now or he himself 18 goals and 16 assists this season he's done nothing
[5296.52 - 5305.32] P:1695.84 E:0.100360 |  wrong can't can't get in the team so the referee is finally I mean that was a lengthy stoppage that
[5306.28 - 5312.12] P:1630.17 E:0.092141 |  is going to for what as well well I know I know he's gone off Dembele but you know
[5313.00 - 5316.44] P:1823.23 E:0.098756 |  just just just wait for the ball to go out of play and make the substitution.
[5317.48 - 5322.20] P:1664.54 E:0.100433 |  Arsenal nil Paris Saint-Germain won in the first leg of this Champions League semi-final
[5322.20 - 5327.72] P:1551.98 E:0.100651 |  Arsenal's first semi-final in this competition for 16 years since they lost to Manchester United
[5327.72 - 5334.20] P:1777.51 E:0.104047 |  back in 2009 that was Alex Ferguson against Arsenal and Arsenal now trying to
[5336.12 - 5339.40] P:1742.86 E:0.104383 |  get themselves on the score sheet with something to take to Paris.
[5340.36 - 5348.84] P:1615.20 E:0.094783 |  Ball is played in field by Kibbe Or to Saliba and then Timber here is Saka Arsenal certainly
[5348.84 - 5355.56] P:1664.79 E:0.097068 |  looking to Saka to to create that piece of magic that they need against the French champions.
[5356.44 - 5361.16] P:1600.63 E:0.104334 |  Last round Arsenal knocked out the Spanish champions he has Martin Elliott way down the
[5361.16 - 5364.76] P:1604.41 E:0.094617 |  left his left foot had crossed in that's headed away on the edge of the box it was little Petinha
[5364.76 - 5371.40] P:1617.18 E:0.097013 |  who was back in there to head it away Arsenal again whether it's Martin Elliott on the left or Saka
[5371.40 - 5378.20] P:1563.27 E:0.094713 |  on the right that's what Arsenal need that bit of incisiveness somebody to to produce the the
[5378.20 - 5384.44] P:1490.19 E:0.106006 |  inspiration the moment of quality that can break down Paris Saint-Germain Arsenal go long again
[5384.44 - 5392.36] P:1459.33 E:0.094436 |  Saliba's pass that is taken down there on the right by Timber then it comes in field to Odegaard
[5392.36 - 5400.68] P:1546.56 E:0.088938 |  Odegaard 25 yards out Rice now forward of the centre circle Rice upright looks to his left
[5400.68 - 5405.72] P:1661.97 E:0.094790 |  fact goes back to Kivio then the pass to Martin Elliott heals on the white line Martin Elliott
[5405.72 - 5412.36] P:1647.92 E:0.092238 |  past Barca that but then uses the pass to Luis Scali Kivio goes squared good zip about the passing
[5412.36 - 5417.56] P:1638.47 E:0.093117 |  here for Arsenal but we're into the last 20 minutes now here at the Emirates.
[5417.56 - 5422.84] P:1660.48 E:0.098108 |  Odegaard's left foot has passed down the right hand side Timber over there in the full back
[5422.84 - 5427.80] P:1692.88 E:0.095403 |  position drags it back to the corner of the box Odegaard lifts it in deep but Donnaroma comes
[5427.80 - 5432.92] P:1707.62 E:0.102975 |  and is able to claim that quite easily really for a goalkeeper of that standard. It's not quite enough
[5432.92 - 5440.20] P:1752.74 E:0.099331 |  pace on the cross from Martin Odegaard Arsenal working it really patiently nice amount of passing
[5440.20 - 5445.00] P:1730.45 E:0.099645 |  and Odegaard gets the ball on the inside right position on his left foot that in swinging whipped
[5445.00 - 5449.56] P:1687.58 E:0.094705 |  ball that he normally plays so well he just lofted it a little bit too much made it easy for
[5449.56 - 5454.84] P:1687.63 E:0.096355 |  Donnaroma to decide to come and claim plenty of time to come and take that ball and Arsenal have
[5454.84 - 5459.88] P:1734.98 E:0.101548 |  just lacked you mentioned a moment ago John that little bit of incisiveness that moment from a
[5459.88 - 5465.00] P:1753.19 E:0.097702 |  sack of from an Odegaard that's really punchy I mean Declan Rice showed it with that driving run
[5465.72 - 5470.76] P:1584.02 E:0.096200 |  with the save from Donnaroma but other than that it hasn't really been much produced from Arsenal.
[5471.24 - 5477.08] P:1616.04 E:0.103864 |  David Grier long pass out from the back that Timber's going to do well to keep in play does
[5477.08 - 5482.28] P:1647.96 E:0.103305 |  jumping with his head but ball in field. Cavarad Schalers going for a goal from way way out but
[5482.84 - 5487.48] P:1677.18 E:0.101697 |  it did not threaten Grier's goal it dropped well wide and behind and we're going to see
[5487.48 - 5495.40] P:1615.42 E:0.106275 |  Gonzalo Ramos coming on very shortly for PSG so second Paris Saint-Germain change coming right up
[5496.04 - 5502.60] P:1615.32 E:0.100755 |  so the Portuguese international who himself has scored 15 goals this season Gonzalo Ramos and
[5503.48 - 5508.12] P:1633.28 E:0.119211 |  we saw him score against Manchester City didn't we? Cross-eyed is felled by Joana there's not a
[5508.12 - 5513.80] P:1598.53 E:0.098303 |  pre-game to Arsenal just outside their own box not sure if it'll happen now will it no not yet
[5513.80 - 5523.16] P:1606.74 E:0.099830 |  Kivio's long pass Timber's got a bit of time here Clarit Kehle was chasing back Saka back to Timber
[5523.88 - 5525.88] P:1558.69 E:0.109943 |  who took his eye off the ball and that meant that
[5527.80 - 5533.88] P:1683.01 E:0.099370 |  Nuno Mendes was able to just get a foot in there Arsenal come again Odegaard Miles Lewis Skelly
[5536.12 - 5540.04] P:1690.65 E:0.111388 |  and then Kivio looks for Rice who's dropped a little deeper into the centre circle Rice's
[5540.04 - 5547.08] P:1642.64 E:0.089450 |  pass forward Saka rather tucked in position on the right hand side then goes wider to Timber
[5547.08 - 5552.12] P:1716.52 E:0.100144 |  Saka continues his run down into the full back position then turns looks to get into the penalty
[5552.12 - 5557.40] P:1651.92 E:0.101447 |  area but excellent defending Nuno Mendes just stepped in shows that he can defend as well Nuno
[5557.40 - 5562.60] P:1665.86 E:0.089006 |  Mendes brilliant tremendous I will say Saka's had to play around with his positioning because I know
[5562.60 - 5568.28] P:1705.88 E:0.098792 |  that he's getting much change out of him 1v1 when he tries to isolate him wide Saka loves to draw
[5568.28 - 5572.60] P:1815.72 E:0.094389 |  players out wide and hug the touch line but he's coming inside the pitch because he's just not
[5572.60 - 5576.36] P:1850.74 E:0.119829 |  getting enough of the ball and he's having to pick it up in a bit more of a central area
[5577.32 - 5582.68] P:1827.47 E:0.108801 |  well it's it's just become rather cagey this over the over the recent minutes because I'm sure
[5582.68 - 5587.32] P:1631.79 E:0.105500 |  Paris Saint-Germain they would absolutely take this score line we will see Gonzalo Ramos coming
[5587.32 - 5592.44] P:1721.11 E:0.092472 |  on so it's another attacking player who is going to replace I presume that is Douay coming off
[5592.44 - 5598.52] P:1759.49 E:0.089912 |  he's walking over here yeah to to this side of the field and Luis Enrique is going through a
[5599.56 - 5605.72] P:1704.79 E:0.092931 |  it's quite pet guardiola that isn't it the the hand signals there then his hands behind his back
[5605.72 - 5611.96] P:1734.50 E:0.102700 |  then one hand in the air and that was all for Cabaret's calias benefit
[5613.00 - 5617.72] P:1722.25 E:0.100824 |  presuming knows what that means I have no clue I mean he gave him a little nod at the head John
[5618.76 - 5626.68] P:1763.20 E:0.100947 |  that's all he needed just to know message well and truly receive well all of the all of the exertions
[5626.68 - 5634.76] P:1589.82 E:0.096493 |  that Luis Enrique goes through has has been well documented the iron men challenges the marathons
[5634.84 - 5641.96] P:1711.29 E:0.099733 |  the cycling you saying yesterday been walking recently he is in great great shape 54 years old
[5641.96 - 5647.00] P:1835.47 E:0.095444 |  he looks as though he could still play his older guard into the area for tross art right side of
[5647.00 - 5652.52] P:1888.79 E:0.096199 |  the box Saka now it's very very tight in there lots of PSG second as well gets the shot in and
[5652.52 - 5658.04] P:1836.44 E:0.105379 |  Donna Roma resolved nemesis is able to make the save just drops down at the near post but actually
[5658.60 - 5666.36] P:1486.38 E:0.098536 |  the offside flag was up so had Saka scored that one would not have stood either well that must
[5666.36 - 5672.20] P:1747.43 E:0.092156 |  have been from very early on in the play in the build up when the ball gets fed out to Saka
[5674.04 - 5679.88] P:1839.76 E:0.111345 |  and it just gets slipped into to tross art initially who then rolls it back to Saka and he is half a
[5679.88 - 5690.28] P:1856.74 E:0.094770 |  yard offside yeah right decision right decision just very late flag so Gonzalo Ramos the number nine
[5691.32 - 5697.64] P:1716.65 E:0.106464 |  is now playing through the middle and partners he ever and Gonzalo Ramos is on to this and lays
[5697.64 - 5703.56] P:1840.59 E:0.102760 |  it square and Barca could be in Barca back to the edge of the area but John now there's lifted
[5703.56 - 5708.44] P:1786.99 E:0.102948 |  over the top who asked no we're exposed for a moment there they've got away with that there
[5708.44 - 5713.96] P:1641.75 E:0.100333 |  they have there's a real breakaway chance it was like a ricochet off of a pass and it just spun
[5713.96 - 5720.04] P:1596.20 E:0.102993 |  into the path of a PSG player it's a clearance from Kivir I think and it rebounds off his own player
[5720.76 - 5725.64] P:1675.28 E:0.101769 |  then Ramos is on the ball feeds it wide it comes back inside to Jaunebbers and he just doesn't get
[5725.64 - 5730.36] P:1611.94 E:0.097997 |  over the top of the ball and it's always rising over the crossbar just a little warning for
[5730.36 - 5736.20] P:1731.73 E:0.109189 |  Arsenal gotta be careful too near will be a disaster tross art strong there against Marquinhos
[5736.20 - 5744.20] P:1652.88 E:0.093841 |  and he's able to to use Marino he holds it up as well Saka does find some space on the right
[5744.20 - 5749.08] P:1703.58 E:0.092809 |  there's been precious little of that but Kvaratskjelja is back there with Nuno Mendes Saka
[5749.96 - 5756.68] P:1619.65 E:0.091517 |  puts his foot on the ball all left foot then uses Odegaard behind him fair hair bobbing
[5758.04 - 5763.56] P:1598.38 E:0.110552 |  Kivir steps forward to join the attack now it's on the left hand side with Martin Ellie
[5763.56 - 5768.20] P:1678.60 E:0.101956 |  Martin Ellie comes in field right for the ball clipped in and it's headed away to the edge of
[5768.20 - 5774.04] P:1698.85 E:0.096352 |  the area where Fabian Ruiz is able to take it down and Fabian Ruiz will just keep possession
[5774.04 - 5781.00] P:1710.64 E:0.093438 |  time beginning to kick down here just over 10 minutes to play in the Emirates and PSG with the
[5781.00 - 5786.12] P:1638.37 E:0.100311 |  advantage and we know I think anyone who's watched Paris Saint-Germain play at the Parc de France
[5786.12 - 5791.08] P:1594.28 E:0.101191 |  this season will know how effective they are particularly in the latter half of the season
[5791.08 - 5796.12] P:1592.48 E:0.104608 |  and yes Liverpool won there Liverpool won with that Harvey Elliott goal when when Allison had a
[5796.12 - 5802.28] P:1567.94 E:0.100449 |  wonder night yeah but they were brilliant that night brilliant against Aston Della brilliant
[5802.28 - 5807.24] P:1573.08 E:0.096667 |  against Manchester City and they're winning one now here with a very effective away from home
[5807.24 - 5813.40] P:1653.39 E:0.093750 |  performance Fabian Ruiz stabs it out towards the left hand side Kvaratskjelja gets his head down
[5813.40 - 5817.16] P:1570.55 E:0.105819 |  now running at timber again as he did time and time again in the first half across the box
[5817.16 - 5821.08] P:1744.48 E:0.104393 |  Kvaratskjelja with the shot though but he's got right underneath that and skied it high across
[5821.08 - 5825.48] P:1686.54 E:0.117923 |  goal and behind into the Arsenal fans yeah just shooting on balance there as he cuts his side
[5825.48 - 5831.16] P:1694.96 E:0.105556 |  onto his right foot Arsenal good distances much better than the first half they've got a little
[5831.16 - 5836.76] P:1729.69 E:0.100740 |  bit tighter a little bit bolder with how they wanted to fend up against PSG and it's paid off in
[5836.76 - 5842.04] P:1735.70 E:0.087185 |  this second half and I think they'll take a lot from this second half into the second leg if I'm
[5842.04 - 5847.40] P:1668.79 E:0.099203 |  honest John I mean if it stays at this or whatever the score line may be I think they'll take a lot
[5847.40 - 5852.68] P:1641.12 E:0.095146 |  from this second half for sure Aston they'll realise how they need to go about this time in the
[5852.68 - 5860.76] P:1624.36 E:0.093883 |  second leg to really win it well they won in the Burnabyal yeah but I think against this team
[5860.76 - 5865.72] P:1653.85 E:0.101618 |  and with Real Madrid in the shape that they were at the time yeah I actually think it's more of a
[5865.72 - 5870.36] P:1712.46 E:0.105507 |  challenge to go and win in the park at the park which is a big statement no I completely agree with
[5870.44 - 5875.32] P:1749.62 E:0.097673 |  that I think you spot on I think Thomas party coming back in will make a big difference there's
[5875.32 - 5881.32] P:1749.91 E:0.115828 |  been certain instances in this game where you just know he would be there that little one that dropped
[5881.32 - 5886.52] P:1733.25 E:0.091582 |  down the edge of the box on the opposition box a moment ago he reads that and he picks up that
[5886.52 - 5892.68] P:1719.78 E:0.104999 |  ball it's not easy for PSG just to get hold of it and then get some possession going he's been a big
[5892.68 - 5898.44] P:1747.59 E:0.098504 |  miss tonight well Michela Teter is going to turn to Ben White and that's going to be the first
[5898.52 - 5906.20] P:1644.07 E:0.092080 |  change Arsenal have made and we are now in the 81st minute which I think tells its own story in terms
[5906.20 - 5911.40] P:1708.40 E:0.106051 |  of options on the bench I mean one area is there but only 18 years old just turned 18
[5912.84 - 5923.00] P:1697.26 E:0.094558 |  Raheem Sterling the ball in the centre circle with Saliba Arsenal desperately want a goal
[5923.88 - 5928.76] P:1701.97 E:0.106089 |  to take for the park difference Nikolaj Teter is called on the crowd to increase the noise
[5928.76 - 5932.20] P:1754.07 E:0.096159 |  long pass forward but Donnaroma comes forward and is able to take that ball
[5932.84 - 5938.44] P:1782.09 E:0.102897 |  too big save from Donnaroma tonight from Martin Ali just before halftime and that's super save
[5939.08 - 5944.12] P:1715.06 E:0.097409 |  from Trossard second one was brilliant same time Raya made the very good save from Dhuye in the first
[5944.12 - 5950.76] P:1863.36 E:0.099381 |  half too so both goalkeepers have played apart so just the one goal so far tonight it is now
[5950.76 - 5955.00] P:1814.43 E:0.104318 |  Burton one Wigan one equaliser very late equaliser for Wigan so it's one one there
[5955.00 - 5961.88] P:1808.86 E:0.090891 |  and actually it's all over and that means that Burton are safe in league one for the next season
[5961.88 - 5967.80] P:1791.96 E:0.103769 |  so congratulations to them one nail to Paris Saint-Germain more European commentaries to come on
[5967.80 - 5972.84] P:1785.53 E:0.101392 |  Thursday night Ian Dennis and Paul Robinson will be making their way to Bill Bowell with
[5972.84 - 5977.96] P:1757.85 E:0.105815 |  Manchester United you'll hear that on five live and Alastair Bruce Ball and Rob Green will bring
[5977.96 - 5983.56] P:1809.79 E:0.088831 |  your commentary on top mum against Vodoglimp on Sports Extra on Thursday night you'll be able
[5983.56 - 5988.60] P:1734.76 E:0.111824 |  to hear all three of us on the commentators view podcast later in the week ask them with a ball
[5988.60 - 5993.08] P:1772.68 E:0.105967 |  inside their own half and referee spotter the handball in there and that's a free kick Lewis
[5993.08 - 6000.20] P:1739.05 E:0.100126 |  Enrique is going absolutely wow on the side of the pitch yeah and um changes being made
[6000.84 - 6007.48] P:1955.67 E:0.103879 |  now to bring on Ben White straight swap Timber's coming off yeah Ben White on yeah Timber's just
[6008.44 - 6013.32] P:1822.97 E:0.108785 |  a little bit hobblings I don't think he's got an injury but whether or not it's just fatigue then
[6014.04 - 6018.76] P:1658.69 E:0.100290 |  fresh set of legs on the right hand side he's had a tough evening Timber he's had a lot of one
[6018.76 - 6026.68] P:1798.99 E:0.087692 |  on one action to have to deal with yes he has you know really tough night in fact I suspect it'll be
[6026.68 - 6033.40] P:1771.43 E:0.099706 |  as challenging tonight as he's had all season I agree Paul headed away by Arsenal Kavaratskalia
[6033.40 - 6038.20] P:1722.79 E:0.103494 |  the same time those bouncing PSG fans in the corner well we're talking about maybe Arsenal
[6038.20 - 6045.80] P:1586.99 E:0.094257 |  getting a goal those Paris Saint-Germain supporters the Ultras the self-styled Ultras will be thinking
[6046.60 - 6053.00] P:1610.48 E:0.101289 |  their team can get another one make it 2-0 they can whip up an atmosphere that popped the France as
[6053.00 - 6057.56] P:1540.06 E:0.106364 |  well can't they we can sample a bit of that against Manchester City but this atmosphere in the second
[6057.56 - 6064.04] P:1758.48 E:0.111585 |  leg will be pretty special oh a touch there from Consola Ramos Barquela's in Barquela rolls the shot
[6064.04 - 6071.00] P:1745.82 E:0.102012 |  across goal and way to the far post that could probably should have been 2-0 PSG
[6071.96 - 6079.40] P:1644.95 E:0.118083 |  wow what a lovely piece of play that is from PSG lovely given goes one two's Barquela does
[6079.40 - 6085.00] P:1727.73 E:0.098280 |  everything right I'm looking at Lewis and Rickey just spins round to the bench with his head in his
[6085.00 - 6090.44] P:1754.71 E:0.098710 |  hands knowing what big chance that is Ramos just pokes it through to him gets there ahead of Kivillot
[6091.40 - 6097.16] P:1810.89 E:0.105196 |  and the finish with his right foot it's a little bit scuffed if I'm honest he doesn't get a clean
[6097.16 - 6104.04] P:1768.84 E:0.092581 |  contact and just drags it about an inch wide of the far post what a big moment at the other end
[6104.04 - 6110.60] P:1739.62 E:0.100129 |  another offside flag against Arsenal so a free kick to PSG it's a wonder we've had only one goal here
[6110.60 - 6118.76] P:1664.93 E:0.110172 |  yeah I mean it's had play that deserves more for sure but I think both teams defensively have done
[6118.76 - 6123.16] P:1529.41 E:0.100567 |  an excellent job I mean it's been you know both have been tough to break down and I think that's
[6123.16 - 6131.00] P:1421.56 E:0.110620 |  been the main reason John and also some top goalkeeping as well to add to that yes one nil to
[6131.00 - 6137.24] P:1647.16 E:0.099190 |  Paris Saint-Germain another little interesting side of this as well that Arsenal have actually
[6137.24 - 6141.88] P:1618.00 E:0.107687 |  got to be a little bit careful with the home match against Bournemouth in terms of who plays in that
[6141.88 - 6147.00] P:1727.54 E:0.111672 |  long pass forward that is taken down by Gonzalo Ramos who dinks it against the crossbar
[6148.20 - 6154.92] P:1609.43 E:0.112962 |  and that was there a flag there or not I couldn't tell you it looked like half a flag came up
[6155.48 - 6159.96] P:1643.27 E:0.116232 |  I mean well he was through I have to say I thought he was probably offside it was a bizarre
[6160.84 - 6166.52] P:1609.17 E:0.106965 |  moment but it's a goal kick yeah I mean it looked like Saliba or Kibbutz it just stopped I mean
[6167.24 - 6173.40] P:1661.75 E:0.115615 |  he was I think he was it looked very very tight but neither player Kibbutz didn't trap back and
[6173.40 - 6179.96] P:1667.72 E:0.099727 |  Saliba didn't really get out to him and then it's a weird kind of toe pun from Ramos the shot is
[6179.96 - 6187.88] P:1633.96 E:0.104843 |  bizarre he doesn't really put his foot there he just toe punts it it was rattles off the crossbar
[6187.96 - 6193.08] P:1730.20 E:0.098358 |  and up into the air and and Arsenal looked like the game had stopped and he was been given offside
[6193.08 - 6199.40] P:1750.41 E:0.098984 |  but he hadn't so that's a let-off for Arsenal as well Barcala and Gonzalo Ramos now could have
[6199.40 - 6204.12] P:1760.39 E:0.103607 |  made it two nil still one nil and time running out now we're into the last five minutes of this
[6204.12 - 6209.64] P:1719.12 E:0.098306 |  first leg here at the Emirates BBC Radio 5 Live with the drama of the Champions League semi-finals
[6209.72 - 6213.80] P:1791.45 E:0.106335 |  and again here's one for Hakimi to chase and Miles Lewis Kelly
[6215.80 - 6220.52] P:1742.19 E:0.106544 |  sort of runs it slows down he puts his body in the way of Hakimi and is pushed over that is what
[6220.52 - 6227.96] P:1777.82 E:0.110376 |  he does he uses his body in between man and ball I'll take the foul thanks right sprays a pass from
[6227.96 - 6234.28] P:1750.66 E:0.101357 |  inside his own half that's taken down by Saka the good work from Kibbutz Kailia close quarters puts
[6234.28 - 6240.36] P:1619.07 E:0.104403 |  the tackle in on Saka we've only seen moments from Saka in this match he has another long pass
[6240.36 - 6244.68] P:1645.37 E:0.104613 |  from Rice this one out to the left hand side that's taken down by Martinelli Martinelli against
[6244.68 - 6252.28] P:1694.98 E:0.114036 |  Hakimi goes past him there was a foul I wasn't sure whether there was or not but Martinelli went
[6252.28 - 6258.28] P:1741.44 E:0.104750 |  crashing down and the free kick is given and it's a set piece for Arsenal in the full back position
[6258.28 - 6266.76] P:1699.34 E:0.093362 |  the PSG right back area and now Arsenal who've made so many set pieces count over the course of
[6266.76 - 6272.44] P:1653.09 E:0.104798 |  the last couple of seasons well they really need one here that's quite a soft foul as well I will
[6272.44 - 6278.36] P:1669.32 E:0.103077 |  say I mean Martinelli running at Hakimi he goes past knocks the ball tries to run around him there's
[6278.36 - 6285.64] P:1600.02 E:0.100483 |  a little bit of contact but not a lot Martinelli makes the most of it to win the foul and it's in a
[6285.64 - 6291.32] P:1647.05 E:0.094025 |  really threatening position this is big for Arsenal I mean they've got away with a couple of
[6291.32 - 6296.68] P:1751.83 E:0.092542 |  scares at the other end but Declan Rice just hovering over this ball and the problem for
[6296.68 - 6302.52] P:1704.07 E:0.100264 |  Donna Romer is he's going to just try and angle this free kick with pace so it just lands around
[6302.52 - 6307.08] P:1840.41 E:0.101875 |  that far post even so that it can just go in if no one touches it and there's going to be a load
[6307.08 - 6311.88] P:1864.04 E:0.097038 |  of Arsenal players just running across the face of it to make the goalkeepers life difficult well
[6311.88 - 6318.76] P:1934.13 E:0.099245 |  Declan Rice of course scored with two free kicks against Real Madrid here in the previous round
[6318.76 - 6325.40] P:1905.21 E:0.092091 |  now they need one of his specialist deliveries Declan Rice staring down this free kick in the
[6325.40 - 6331.08] P:1892.41 E:0.097144 |  full back position Rice comes up right foot it drives it in takes a double deflection then bounces
[6331.08 - 6336.04] P:1670.16 E:0.103832 |  away and it's cleared away volleyed away worked away by the left foot of Cabaret's Kailia and it
[6336.04 - 6343.80] P:1641.04 E:0.098704 |  bounces out of play and I make it we've got two minutes of the 90 to play Arsenal pressing trying
[6343.80 - 6351.32] P:1608.54 E:0.088952 |  to find this equaliser on the night throwing this taken over out of the far side Trossard works it
[6351.32 - 6356.76] P:1690.34 E:0.098450 |  back to all the way to the halfway line it goes to Declan Rice now back in position in the centre
[6356.76 - 6361.72] P:1631.69 E:0.085340 |  circle pulls it onto his right foot there's the long pass looking for Ben White but that's up and
[6361.80 - 6367.80] P:1605.18 E:0.099822 |  headed away by Nuno Mendes then Odegaard with a foot in Saka can't keep it in and it's a throw
[6367.80 - 6373.48] P:1615.73 E:0.104368 |  into PSG and another change coming up and it's going to be the midfielder the young French
[6373.48 - 6378.04] P:1565.16 E:0.108691 |  international another teenager Warren Sayah Emery who's going to come on and replace
[6378.60 - 6383.88] P:1569.98 E:0.109224 |  J'rao Neves who's had yet another good night in a PSG shirt yeah I mean it's a really good player
[6383.88 - 6389.32] P:1540.62 E:0.100957 |  as well to bring on at this stage in the game for PSG they've got such strength in depth another
[6389.32 - 6394.92] P:1536.88 E:0.094997 |  good energetic top quality young player changing positions for another and he's going to come
[6394.92 - 6399.72] P:1614.74 E:0.098088 |  on in that midfield with loads of energy and they need to see this game out I mean Lewis and Rique
[6399.72 - 6404.20] P:1825.26 E:0.092299 |  will have mixed feelings in a way because he's looking at those two chances John they must be
[6404.20 - 6409.64] P:1761.10 E:0.087815 |  thinking a little bit disappointed that they're not too nil up at least than taking that back to
[6409.64 - 6417.64] P:1715.22 E:0.090605 |  Puck de Prons and here is also Ethan Waneri for the final minutes of this match he's going to come
[6417.64 - 6422.04] P:1691.24 E:0.098027 |  on he's a new substitute wasn't he in both legs against Real Madrid so he wasn't able to
[6422.04 - 6429.40] P:1764.27 E:0.104873 |  to get under the pitch there but in their moment of need here and I'd say they really do need a goal
[6430.92 - 6440.68] P:1456.23 E:0.098331 |  one nil to go to Puck de Prons really would be a challenge for Arsenal even given what they did
[6440.68 - 6446.76] P:1568.63 E:0.094486 |  against Real Madrid in the previous round Raya long long ball downfield Saka's going to do well
[6446.76 - 6451.16] P:1629.93 E:0.096100 |  he jumps he heads it infield Nuno Mendes is underneath it to holly it away out of play on
[6451.16 - 6457.64] P:1642.53 E:0.103489 |  the halfway line and here we will see the change Nicolarteta all activity all energy comes forward
[6457.64 - 6461.32] P:1703.63 E:0.113263 |  slaps him on the back and on the bottom and he's going to take the place of the captain
[6462.20 - 6467.88] P:1859.19 E:0.110608 |  Matt yeah Odegaard off yeah well it's late stages of the game and I think Odegaard has
[6468.68 - 6473.88] P:1760.66 E:0.112068 |  quite the influence over this game that he would like to have I mean he's done some good things but
[6474.68 - 6480.44] P:1656.89 E:0.096199 |  it's been tough for him to get involved and get you know stamping his authority on this match
[6480.44 - 6484.76] P:1616.92 E:0.107579 |  it's been a little bit more about Declan Rice I have to say and probably Marino has been
[6484.76 - 6489.24] P:1713.96 E:0.112682 |  the busier two of the Arsenal midfield players so Miles Lewis-Skelly doesn't have that record for
[6489.24 - 6495.32] P:1737.53 E:0.094912 |  long as the youngest Englishman to play in a Champions League semi-final because that is now
[6495.88 - 6502.28] P:1702.47 E:0.096198 |  Ethan Waneri 18 last month and he's into the action well he's not daunted by anything is he
[6502.28 - 6511.00] P:1743.66 E:0.088706 |  nine goals this season and he takes up a position in the Arsenal midfield the number 53
[6511.00 - 6517.88] P:1673.69 E:0.093068 |  Saka and Waneri on the field together ball played back to Marino long pass from him Lewis Enrique
[6517.88 - 6524.04] P:1729.13 E:0.098283 |  looking very concerned here as it's headed out of play by Hakimi throw in Lewis-Skelly is going to
[6524.04 - 6528.28] P:1805.37 E:0.094051 |  take this Marino finds a position on the edge of the box but he turns and he actually plays it back
[6528.28 - 6533.56] P:1823.96 E:0.096044 |  the throw in to Kivio and now all the way back to David Raya well five minutes of added time
[6533.56 - 6544.36] P:1687.61 E:0.096262 |  and we're already into that so time very much running out for Arsenal here is Waneri receiving
[6544.36 - 6550.04] P:1631.65 E:0.087438 |  the ball there out on the on the right flank and then going back to the halfway line and back
[6550.04 - 6556.68] P:1633.78 E:0.103903 |  into their own half Arsenal and indeed all the way back to David Raya the celebrations have already
[6556.68 - 6563.24] P:1638.87 E:0.104201 |  started for the PSG supporters although in saying that that's how they were just before the match
[6563.24 - 6571.08] P:1611.35 E:0.087939 |  started Saliba then forward towards Ben White Arsenal need to go forward but White has to check
[6571.08 - 6576.84] P:1730.91 E:0.095032 |  back put under pressure Raya then forced to go long because Gonzalo Ramos was closing him down
[6576.84 - 6582.92] P:1743.41 E:0.095360 |  then Saka jumps for it headed in field Fabian Ruiz was there to tidy it up and Donnaroma
[6582.92 - 6589.08] P:1708.60 E:0.102844 |  puts his foot through that and plonks it out of play inside the Arsenal half long
[6589.08 - 6593.80] P:1766.03 E:0.093244 |  thrill from Ben White he picked up a ball quickly off the corner there, Vettiniere was dispossessed
[6593.80 - 6598.84] P:1728.75 E:0.109140 |  on the edge of the area then a back yelp flick from Trossard now it's laid across and leaning back
[6598.84 - 6606.52] P:1748.93 E:0.100215 |  Martinelli sends his shot high over the top of the PSG cross barring into the Arsenal fans behind
[6606.52 - 6612.52] P:1570.45 E:0.094489 |  it in the north bank stand. Well I think it was Declan Rice that just saw an opportunity to get
[6612.60 - 6619.56] P:1713.25 E:0.089157 |  after the ball and he puts pressure on PSG I mean it's great anticipation for Rice he nicks
[6619.56 - 6626.68] P:1765.77 E:0.087681 |  in front of Vettiniere wins the ball it then gets towed back to Martinelli from Wanyeri and he just
[6626.68 - 6630.60] P:1741.55 E:0.100892 |  is a little bit ahead of it Martinelli so he can't really get a clean strike on it it's just
[6631.16 - 6640.68] P:1572.77 E:0.090081 |  off balance with the finish in the end. One nil in added time to Luis Enrique's French champions
[6640.92 - 6647.64] P:1500.17 E:0.097827 |  confirmed again the champions this season for a fourth year running the 11th time in 13 seasons
[6648.20 - 6652.44] P:1534.46 E:0.114056 |  dominant on the home front although they did lose on Friday night but they're winning here
[6652.44 - 6657.72] P:1566.79 E:0.107557 |  when it really really matters in the champions league Rice then don't white on the right hand side
[6657.72 - 6664.28] P:1555.68 E:0.096357 |  here is Wanyeri again Wanyeri beginning to drift in field Arsenal trying to find that moment in
[6664.28 - 6669.08] P:1696.78 E:0.102431 |  added time across it comes to Marinelli who lids it off a stretch from Wanyeri but the teenager
[6669.08 - 6676.84] P:1767.45 E:0.099826 |  is dispossessed and then Cavarra T'Calia loses out and it is taken away well by Declan Rice
[6676.84 - 6682.92] P:1748.06 E:0.106051 |  under under pressure there Rice is able to receive it back and then rolls the pass along the ground
[6682.92 - 6688.12] P:1752.50 E:0.099112 |  to Martinelli Martinelli against Hakimi takes him on round the outside Hakimi's able to go with
[6688.12 - 6692.28] P:1769.90 E:0.118320 |  Martinelli and then he plays it off and then wins the corner corner to Arsenal from the left
[6693.00 - 6697.16] P:1720.87 E:0.104720 |  we're in the fourth minute of added time match yeah it's clever from Martinelli actually it's not
[6697.24 - 6703.88] P:1622.19 E:0.102672 |  a lot there he's going down a dead end trying to run Hakimi on the outside and he just flicks it
[6703.88 - 6709.32] P:1713.12 E:0.111918 |  up against him to win the corner on purpose knowing that this is Arsenal's best opportunity to
[6710.20 - 6716.12] P:1740.79 E:0.102988 |  to get anything out of this game and Declan Rice just wanders over to the ball as they set it all up
[6716.12 - 6724.28] P:1901.56 E:0.090378 |  best opportunity perhaps last opportunity yes Rice walked across there all focus and concentration
[6724.92 - 6730.12] P:1915.86 E:0.101409 |  now he's ready referee's whistle goes Arsenal players lined up beyond the far post
[6730.68 - 6735.96] P:1857.56 E:0.100385 |  Rice with the delivery deep to the back post headed across but the referee blown his whistle
[6735.96 - 6740.28] P:1743.72 E:0.106155 |  he's seen something in there that he doesn't like Donoroma's on the ground he's saying that the
[6740.28 - 6745.40] P:1696.98 E:0.103465 |  PSG goalkeeper has been impeded he's been fouled and he's given a free kick to the visitors
[6746.12 - 6753.24] P:1579.29 E:0.093421 |  yeah I mean it was hard to tell the referee was very adamant went sprinting over to Donoroma to
[6753.24 - 6760.68] P:1600.47 E:0.093096 |  check that he's okay I think the Arsenal staff on the bench are getting a little bit of stick from
[6760.68 - 6765.80] P:1659.00 E:0.094112 |  the fourth official for coming out and wanting to speak to the referee is Ben White who just
[6765.80 - 6772.52] P:1631.04 E:0.094609 |  walks across Donoroma who does make the most of it I think Ben White does maybe engage the contact
[6772.52 - 6777.16] P:1545.21 E:0.096653 |  but it's not a lie it doesn't need to be a lot does it for at this stage for Parrish just to run
[6777.16 - 6786.04] P:1743.77 E:0.104739 |  the clock down that is it five minutes about a time of gone PSG have won the first leg Lewis Enrique
[6786.60 - 6792.84] P:1851.48 E:0.106460 |  looks very satisfied with his team's night's work slaps hands with his coaches Michael Arter is
[6792.84 - 6801.24] P:1757.06 E:0.101025 |  quickly across to Lewis Enrique the Champions League theme goes and with this scoreline the odds are
[6801.24 - 6809.96] P:1794.78 E:0.099963 |  now against Arsenal hearing this theme in Munich in the final next month PSG winning it with that
[6809.96 - 6817.72] P:1784.56 E:0.103642 |  very well work early goal Dembele the star he started it Kavara Tkeliac laid it back to him
[6817.72 - 6822.92] P:1870.17 E:0.109416 |  and he finished it brilliantly from the edge of the box and in off the post that in the fourth
[6822.92 - 6828.92] P:1730.48 E:0.103216 |  minute match and that was the end of the scoring yeah it was tough for Arsenal to to take that
[6828.92 - 6834.12] P:1782.04 E:0.112923 |  actually and it I think it shocked them and then put them on the back foot a little bit and PSG
[6834.12 - 6840.68] P:1895.68 E:0.098469 |  fully took control of that first half but there was a shift in the second half Arsenal came out
[6841.32 - 6847.96] P:1824.89 E:0.108763 |  more believe more physical got closer got tighter made life more difficult and I think you saw
[6848.68 - 6854.52] P:1896.08 E:0.106948 |  that they can still do damage in this tie Thomas party's coming back into that is going to be key
[6855.32 - 6861.24] P:1826.87 E:0.109069 |  but Arsenal not out of it yet disappointing result yes for sure they would wanted something out of
[6861.24 - 6866.28] P:1848.92 E:0.104142 |  this game but I think there's something there for them to hold on to that they can still go away
[6866.28 - 6873.16] P:1893.33 E:0.105659 |  from home and go through to the final so yes remember we saw Dona Romo super saves but Raya
[6873.16 - 6881.48] P:1908.93 E:0.096598 |  saves as well and Barca last chance and Gonzalo Ramos is dink against the crossbar Arsenal could have
[6882.44 - 6889.08] P:1954.19 E:0.104365 |  salvaged something but PSG could have won by more and their supporters in that corner it's all
[6889.08 - 6896.84] P:1951.85 E:0.097838 |  scarves up and as you said Matt they are very well capable of whipping up a brilliant atmosphere
[6896.84 - 6901.16] P:1937.43 E:0.102243 |  in the park to France next week that's what Arsenal are going to be up against
[6902.68 - 6908.68] P:1979.75 E:0.097759 |  and the full-time score in the first leg here Arsenal nil Paris Saint-Germain won and Kelly
[6908.68 - 6913.32] P:1838.99 E:0.106365 |  Keds is here with us John Murray and Matt Upton here at the Emirates and John mentioned the
[6913.32 - 6918.44] P:1833.36 E:0.102457 |  atmosphere in the park de France in the return leg of this fixture with the Paris fans are still
[6918.44 - 6922.68] P:1791.03 E:0.102327 |  celebrating over in the corner to our far right as the players make their way over there but they
[6922.68 - 6928.60] P:1795.14 E:0.100858 |  won't want to celebrate too soon because it is only one nil at the halfway stage of of this time
[6928.60 - 6934.60] P:1831.13 E:0.095908 |  we'll talk more between now and 10 30 Matt about what Arsenal can do in in Paris where do you think
[6934.76 - 6940.28] P:1855.88 E:0.093622 |  the damage was done tonight at the Emirates I think they just knocked the confidence a little
[6940.28 - 6947.32] P:1847.72 E:0.096837 |  bit that early goal and it was such a sharp fast start from PSG credit to them the way they were
[6947.32 - 6952.84] P:1813.91 E:0.096316 |  playing the build up to that goal there was a really inciting pass broke the lines from the
[6952.84 - 6959.88] P:1832.71 E:0.089663 |  centre back through into the midfield they were off fed wide and the directness the movement
[6959.88 - 6965.08] P:1747.77 E:0.085409 |  the power it was confident and I think it just rocked their belief a little bit for me and
[6965.08 - 6969.80] P:1766.84 E:0.095333 |  Arsenal hung on in there but PSG dominated a large part of that second half and looked the better
[6969.80 - 6976.60] P:1744.08 E:0.086667 |  team second half was it was a was a different game I thought Arsenal came back out realizing right
[6976.60 - 6980.04] P:1671.51 E:0.092413 |  we've got to get on top of this we've got to be more physical we've got the midfield we've got to
[6980.04 - 6984.20] P:1768.76 E:0.093073 |  get hold of the game better Declan Rice started to make those runs and created a couple of really
[6984.20 - 6989.24] P:1820.52 E:0.092779 |  good chances and it was a really well balanced second half I have to say Paris had their chances
[6989.24 - 6995.00] P:1762.84 E:0.085884 |  as John mentioned and then off the crossfire and what have you but so did Arsenal and I think it's
[6995.00 - 7001.40] P:1856.54 E:0.094969 |  quite nicely poised for a second leg in Paris did that sort of slightly calmer second half suit
[7001.40 - 7007.24] P:1876.50 E:0.092806 |  Arsenal more because if that first half felt frantic and frenetic and then it just seemed to be
[7007.24 - 7011.32] P:1719.17 E:0.097834 |  a little bit more grown up actually on both sides yeah I think PSG decided they're going to get
[7011.32 - 7015.08] P:1660.26 E:0.087360 |  the work done early and that that might have been the plan there might have been that you know we
[7015.08 - 7019.80] P:1878.63 E:0.087465 |  fast stuff that we start fast we go after him we're aggressive with our decision making we're
[7019.80 - 7025.48] P:1831.82 E:0.086562 |  going to press we're going to we feel like we're the superior outfit and and that's the mentality
[7025.48 - 7030.36] P:1822.36 E:0.094424 |  that they started the game with and over time it balanced out as you'd expect two really good teams
[7030.36 - 7036.92] P:1803.18 E:0.082315 |  I thought Arsenal got back into it and the midfield wasn't quite as on point as what it had been
[7037.48 - 7042.84] P:1796.84 E:0.093203 |  and we touched on it before and that missing player in Thomas party it is a big deal for Arsenal
[7042.84 - 7049.80] P:1851.50 E:0.087258 |  he will be back in that second leg perhaps that might really change the change the complex of how
[7049.80 - 7054.20] P:1703.07 E:0.099928 |  they play and is there an element as well of knowing what to expect from Paris though because
[7054.20 - 7057.72] P:1630.35 E:0.094758 |  I imagine they're going to want to go out and make a fast start again particularly when they're
[7057.72 - 7062.12] P:1744.14 E:0.092544 |  when they're at home but once you've been through that experience once are you more prepared the
[7062.12 - 7069.48] P:1565.65 E:0.080999 |  second time yes definitely and the experience of being away at Real Madrid certainly will help
[7069.56 - 7074.04] P:1681.29 E:0.083516 |  Arsenal in that atmosphere I think the atmosphere like John said will be more I think it'll be
[7074.04 - 7078.92] P:1655.32 E:0.085874 |  quite hostile it'll be loud it'll it'll have a real buzz around it and you'll have to you know
[7079.72 - 7086.68] P:1805.68 E:0.083256 |  overcome that and there will be rocky moments but I feel Arsenal if they can stay in the game
[7087.24 - 7093.64] P:1810.96 E:0.078656 |  they'll get stronger and stronger and build as the game goes on and you know we'll have to wait
[7093.64 - 7099.64] P:1840.87 E:0.081589 |  and see but it's not a disastrous result but like John said it is a tough one as PSG have
[7100.36 - 7104.44] P:1784.42 E:0.099021 |  I know they're not the favourites according to the octa-super computer which we all have to listen
[7104.44 - 7110.04] P:1863.98 E:0.090885 |  to that may be adjusted actually after this result might be tweaked but you're right Matt that
[7110.04 - 7115.72] P:1830.33 E:0.094178 |  the better at whipping up an atmosphere in the park de France than they are whipping up a decent
[7115.72 - 7121.16] P:1774.39 E:0.097342 |  sized sandwich a good spread maybe might not be there but you know what that's going to be at
[7121.16 - 7125.40] P:1831.91 E:0.102988 |  the forefront of every Arsenal fans mind who's listening to this is will John Murray get fed at
[7125.40 - 7131.40] P:1840.02 E:0.096389 |  the park de France the big concern I'll be all right Kelly don't worry I know you will be you make
[7131.40 - 7135.64] P:1886.53 E:0.099374 |  sure you make sure you will be John Murray and Matthew Upsham with us through till 10 30 will
[7135.64 - 7139.96] P:1790.81 E:0.099076 |  also be joined by Julian Laurent as we'll be reflecting on a 1-0 defeat for Arsenal at the
[7139.96 - 7144.68] P:1797.80 E:0.094993 |  Emirates Paris Saint-Germain with that goal from Dembele to make it 1-0 as they head to the park de
[7144.68 - 7150.04] P:1891.19 E:0.094158 |  France for the second leg of this Champions League semi-final lots more reaction to that elsewhere
