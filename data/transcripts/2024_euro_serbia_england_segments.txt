[0.00 - 4.24] P:1485.73 E:0.042875 |  Saudi champions, Milinkovic Sadec also plays with him in that team.
[4.24 - 8.72] P:1412.63 E:0.101901 |  So the referee, Daniella R Sato, this is his last tournament
[8.72 - 11.08] P:1385.24 E:0.102260 |  before he retires from refereeing.
[11.08 - 14.44] P:1401.86 E:0.100709 |  He's got the ball at his feet and he's just arranging everyone
[14.44 - 18.84] P:1546.17 E:0.096225 |  for the start of England's campaign at Euro 2024.
[18.84 - 20.68] P:1632.17 E:0.097848 |  Matt Upsson is beside me, is he,
[20.68 - 22.84] P:1489.44 E:0.100794 |  Chris Stinson will hear from her regularly.
[22.84 - 27.04] P:1617.13 E:0.097536 |  She's down behind the goal, behind Jordan Pickford's goal in the first half.
[27.12 - 30.20] P:1587.28 E:0.098759 |  But Matt, up here in the commentary box, how are you feeling?
[30.20 - 34.48] P:1604.85 E:0.104869 |  Well, I'm still coming down from that England national anthem rendition, to be honest.
[34.48 - 37.48] P:1602.76 E:0.115670 |  I thought it was fantastic around the stadium, really big moment.
[37.48 - 41.84] P:1709.70 E:0.103950 |  The players soaked it all up, we're really passionate, we've got involved
[41.84 - 45.68] P:1694.13 E:0.108961 |  and the anticipation is really bubbling inside this stadium.
[45.68 - 49.60] P:1661.40 E:0.100054 |  And England are already out in position, Serbia huddled together,
[49.60 - 52.08] P:1528.77 E:0.093717 |  but you can tell we really want to get on with it here.
[52.08 - 54.56] P:1693.88 E:0.106911 |  Well, England were close three years ago,
[54.60 - 59.92] P:1659.59 E:0.097198 |  runners up at the last Euros, there were a penalty shootout away,
[59.92 - 63.92] P:1604.89 E:0.105430 |  but now the feeling is that this is their most informed squad.
[63.92 - 66.68] P:1738.41 E:0.096276 |  That's how Harry Kane described it to me,
[66.68 - 68.88] P:1783.86 E:0.110430 |  that Gareth Southgate has taken to a tournament.
[68.88 - 72.28] P:1668.78 E:0.097782 |  Gareth Southgate's fourth tournament as manager.
[72.28 - 77.16] P:1613.48 E:0.108106 |  And it's going to be Bukaj Osaka, the man who missed the deciding penalty,
[77.16 - 79.32] P:1783.01 E:0.113087 |  who kicks off for England.
[79.32 - 82.08] P:1876.03 E:0.100051 |  I think that's a great move for England.
[82.12 - 85.48] P:1713.95 E:0.104618 |  A little nod to what happened in the past and how things might be different.
[85.48 - 87.68] P:1639.85 E:0.099737 |  He played it all the way back to Pickford,
[87.68 - 92.64] P:1597.22 E:0.104187 |  who then strikes it long in left-footed downfield into the Serbia right back area.
[92.64 - 93.76] P:1498.82 E:0.072731 |  It's deflected.
[93.76 - 98.64] P:1674.40 E:0.107789 |  And then here is John Stones, who's under a little bit of difficulty against Blaovic.
[98.64 - 101.00] P:1717.62 E:0.095979 |  And then Stones into the challenge again,
[101.00 - 105.32] P:1739.42 E:0.097194 |  and Rice is able to come across and trip here as well, back to Gey on the edge of the box.
[105.32 - 109.56] P:1716.41 E:0.105023 |  They could have a little bit of an English Premier League feel this game.
[109.56 - 111.88] P:1527.09 E:0.098315 |  You can tell from the start a little bit long.
[111.88 - 115.92] P:1647.71 E:0.105236 |  Every ball that comes forward just there, Mitrovic challenging with Gere.
[115.92 - 119.20] P:1454.08 E:0.100726 |  He got no intention of winning the ball, but just wants to bounce him,
[119.20 - 120.92] P:1481.62 E:0.103334 |  stop the centre-back from clearing it,
[120.92 - 124.28] P:1514.64 E:0.094383 |  and John Stones having to drop and clean up behind.
[124.28 - 127.72] P:1494.88 E:0.112196 |  And I think as a partnership, they're going to have to be really aware of that this evening.
[127.72 - 131.20] P:1534.90 E:0.107562 |  They're going to relieve a lot of pressure at Serbia by going long,
[131.20 - 134.28] P:1629.57 E:0.099787 |  and Mitrovic is going to make himself a real nuisance.
[134.28 - 139.56] P:1525.50 E:0.102493 |  England in the almost all-white kit, playing from right to left as we look.
[139.64 - 143.44] P:1504.59 E:0.103839 |  And here's Jude Bellingham into the action for the first time on the left-hand side.
[143.44 - 148.80] P:1787.33 E:0.103448 |  Jude Bellingham, who missed the two warm-up matches after all of the Real Madrid exertions.
[148.80 - 153.56] P:1863.12 E:0.108091 |  Now Pukaj Osaka on the right-hand side, on his left foot, takes it back out to the far side.
[153.56 - 157.96] P:1833.12 E:0.090867 |  Kyle Walker is there, Premier League-winning captain this past season.
[157.96 - 163.16] P:1796.98 E:0.094295 |  So Walker and Stones together again on the right-hand side of the England defence.
[163.16 - 165.72] P:1641.55 E:0.098662 |  Phil Forden, number 11 on his back.
[165.80 - 168.16] P:1674.06 E:0.098712 |  Forden actually in quite a central position.
[168.16 - 171.00] P:1491.86 E:0.099004 |  Just currently Harry Kane's come out to the left-hand side,
[171.00 - 174.80] P:1413.22 E:0.103303 |  but England have got the ball in the central third of the field, Rice.
[174.80 - 178.80] P:1582.69 E:0.101800 |  And now here's Forden, trying to find the space to sack out Forden.
[178.80 - 181.00] P:1508.75 E:0.096782 |  Still on the right flank, really.
[181.00 - 183.28] P:1610.32 E:0.113387 |  Trent Alexander-Arnold in this midfield position.
[183.28 - 186.20] P:1513.47 E:0.110402 |  Oh, lovely, a lovely little flick and a trick from him.
[186.20 - 189.48] P:1477.69 E:0.099340 |  I thought Forden might have been fouled by Gudal there,
[189.48 - 191.08] P:1536.19 E:0.104737 |  but England have still got possession.
[191.08 - 193.92] P:1420.19 E:0.097881 |  Stones just pides his time, gives it the game.
[193.92 - 199.08] P:1463.86 E:0.102987 |  Again, out of trivia, the out of position, left back, the cut in field.
[199.08 - 204.20] P:1497.98 E:0.111212 |  And it's cleared away downfield by Belgevich for England to take up possession again,
[204.20 - 206.36] P:1414.04 E:0.100515 |  just inside their own half-match.
[206.36 - 207.76] P:1429.73 E:0.115553 |  Yes, interesting, isn't it?
[207.76 - 211.68] P:1529.47 E:0.100916 |  Very central, Phil Forden at the moment and Bellingham.
[211.68 - 216.00] P:1454.66 E:0.106073 |  It's almost like a licence to kind of drift into areas where he feels
[216.00 - 219.80] P:1545.64 E:0.094572 |  he can get on the ball and do some damage, which when you've got that kind of talent,
[219.80 - 223.08] P:1530.72 E:0.097197 |  you probably are best off leaving a little bit of freedom of movement
[223.12 - 224.56] P:1815.89 E:0.099288 |  to pick up those positions.
[224.56 - 226.32] P:1733.58 E:0.098589 |  I think that's the intention, Matt.
[226.32 - 229.40] P:1840.70 E:0.107533 |  And Forden is still there now in a very central position,
[229.40 - 232.84] P:1772.58 E:0.098158 |  as Sacher is tripped on the far side, and that's a pretty kick to England,
[232.84 - 234.68] P:1677.22 E:0.098856 |  halfway inside the Serbia half.
[234.68 - 239.48] P:1683.25 E:0.083472 |  Serbia, who are the world-ranked number 33 team.
[239.48 - 243.60] P:1719.96 E:0.097791 |  So in this group, we know that Slovenia and Denmark drew 1-1 earlier.
[243.60 - 247.32] P:1733.51 E:0.086761 |  Denmark, 21st in the world, Slovenia, 57th.
[247.32 - 250.76] P:1740.10 E:0.095563 |  But England, 4th in the world rankings.
[250.84 - 254.44] P:1618.92 E:0.106161 |  These Euros only, Hansen Belgium, are higher placed.
[254.44 - 258.40] P:1554.36 E:0.103354 |  And they've got an early chance for a set piece here after Sacher won the foul.
[258.40 - 259.64] P:1610.55 E:0.101043 |  And it's that man over, isn't it?
[259.64 - 263.48] P:1640.76 E:0.098035 |  Trent Alexander-Arnold, what kind of delivery can he put in here with his right foot?
[263.48 - 266.28] P:1745.32 E:0.106448 |  Left arm raised, right footed into the area, it's headed away,
[266.28 - 267.88] P:1662.98 E:0.094733 |  comes out the trippier on the edge of the box.
[267.88 - 270.12] P:1799.04 E:0.087906 |  He stabs it wide to the left, to Declan Rice.
[270.12 - 274.68] P:1676.98 E:0.092426 |  Declan Rice now just looks and then plays it back centrally to the centre circle.
[274.68 - 278.36] P:1783.51 E:0.103778 |  In all three of Garas Southgate's tournaments so far as manager,
[278.44 - 281.56] P:1433.49 E:0.096045 |  England have won their opening matches.
[281.56 - 285.32] P:1544.51 E:0.104086 |  Do you remember in Russia, it was a win against Tunisia, a late win.
[285.32 - 290.60] P:1559.76 E:0.106991 |  And then at the Euros last time, it was Croatia who were beaten by one goal to Nile.
[290.60 - 295.56] P:1425.32 E:0.099313 |  And then in the World Cup, that Hansen 6-2 win against Iran.
[295.56 - 297.56] P:1518.89 E:0.105453 |  Nile Nile in the very early stages.
[297.56 - 302.32] P:1401.67 E:0.095449 |  Five live from the BBC and Declan Rice in the centre circle,
[302.32 - 304.76] P:1477.66 E:0.100314 |  turns with his right foot, finds Alexander-Arnold,
[304.84 - 306.76] P:1539.13 E:0.083534 |  who's over towards the right flank.
[306.76 - 313.72] P:1719.29 E:0.090031 |  And the Liverpool man just knocks it in field where Declan Rice can now
[314.92 - 317.56] P:1816.75 E:0.113262 |  just pull the ball across to the left-hand side to Gage.
[317.56 - 321.16] P:1733.66 E:0.098535 |  Trippier, England are absolutely dominating the possession
[321.16 - 323.24] P:1579.30 E:0.096606 |  in the early stages of this match,
[323.24 - 327.16] P:1474.96 E:0.104773 |  attacking towards the end where those two tiers of Serbia fans,
[327.16 - 330.04] P:1416.62 E:0.101838 |  mainly in red shirts, are watching down.
[330.04 - 332.92] P:1416.60 E:0.101190 |  Folder, back to Jude Bellingham.
[332.92 - 336.52] P:1471.57 E:0.098333 |  Bellingham drops to 21 later this month, Jude Bellingham.
[336.52 - 339.48] P:1498.94 E:0.085265 |  But this is already his third major tournament
[339.48 - 344.44] P:1562.81 E:0.097140 |  after he made his debut on the big stage at the Euros three years ago.
[345.24 - 348.84] P:1501.30 E:0.103559 |  Kyle Walker now again, still the ball spending all of the time
[348.84 - 351.80] P:1328.32 E:0.093568 |  in the central third of the field in England possession.
[351.80 - 353.64] P:1534.82 E:0.102712 |  As John Stone strides forward with it.
[353.64 - 356.20] P:1621.73 E:0.111200 |  Now here is Bellingham, Bellingham approaching the penalty area
[356.20 - 359.08] P:1790.64 E:0.099577 |  into Fordham who took the ball on his instep, turned,
[359.08 - 360.84] P:1692.50 E:0.087335 |  and it just got away from him.
[360.84 - 364.04] P:1598.05 E:0.091592 |  And Serbia walloped out of the way downfield.
[364.04 - 367.40] P:1633.79 E:0.095841 |  A lovely pass, Jude Bellingham turned on it.
[367.40 - 370.04] P:1649.63 E:0.107790 |  Phil Folder now slaps his hands in the air knowing
[370.04 - 372.28] P:1570.82 E:0.100871 |  that he's got the quality to take that ball on the turn.
[372.28 - 374.44] P:1695.94 E:0.100446 |  Walker goes for a long pass, Trippier heads it back,
[374.44 - 376.36] P:1705.76 E:0.090006 |  first time shot on the edge of the box.
[376.36 - 379.24] P:1668.26 E:0.105329 |  There was a bit of a snapshot really by Fordham on the edge of the area
[379.24 - 383.00] P:1653.42 E:0.096937 |  and actually the assistant's flag was a judge to be offside.
[383.00 - 384.28] P:1713.89 E:0.109278 |  Yeah, it was a little bit frustrated.
[384.28 - 387.64] P:1525.48 E:0.096134 |  It popped back to him and I don't think he was quite set for that effort.
[387.64 - 389.72] P:1660.72 E:0.092495 |  But moments ago the pass from Bellingham,
[389.72 - 391.40] P:1549.61 E:0.097954 |  I mean, it really wasn't on.
[391.40 - 393.64] P:1564.59 E:0.098326 |  He just really tried his hand and forced it
[393.64 - 396.92] P:1386.33 E:0.090689 |  and that's what England have to do this evening.
[396.92 - 398.36] P:1382.22 E:0.110674 |  Serbia are going to sit so deep,
[398.36 - 400.52] P:1413.88 E:0.080511 |  they're going to try and get a bank of five
[400.52 - 402.04] P:1437.63 E:0.095110 |  and then a bank of three or four in front
[402.04 - 403.64] P:1438.53 E:0.079967 |  and really block England out.
[403.64 - 405.16] P:1666.04 E:0.092334 |  You've got to try and find those balls.
[405.16 - 407.24] P:1650.74 E:0.097218 |  You can only do it by being aggressive with your passing
[407.24 - 410.04] P:1485.27 E:0.085579 |  and Jude Bellingham certainly was there with that one.
[410.04 - 412.92] P:1361.71 E:0.083051 |  Matt Ubson went to the World Cup with England.
[412.92 - 417.00] P:1651.01 E:0.093082 |  I'm sure it brought back memories watching England in the tunnel for you.
[417.00 - 418.84] P:1557.50 E:0.083329 |  Yep, absolutely, that feeling.
[420.04 - 421.40] P:1593.87 E:0.097426 |  Trying to be calm.
[421.40 - 425.72] P:1558.04 E:0.104252 |  Yeah, it must be the most nervous that you feel, surely.
[425.72 - 427.48] P:1652.49 E:0.107603 |  As Serbia, this is their first attack.
[427.48 - 430.52] P:1672.34 E:0.090823 |  The ball pulled in at the top of Lavač, who's jumping for it.
[431.24 - 432.60] P:1564.79 E:0.090257 |  Couldn't get there.
[432.60 - 434.84] P:1643.52 E:0.103141 |  Tribje wasn't able to clear away.
[434.84 - 439.00] P:1575.26 E:0.102577 |  So Serbia now have it on this right-hand side with Lukic
[439.00 - 441.56] P:1573.05 E:0.107059 |  and they go back towards the halfway line.
[442.20 - 444.36] P:1707.99 E:0.094890 |  So yeah, the other match in this group,
[444.36 - 445.80] P:1435.89 E:0.100801 |  Slovenia won Denmark won.
[445.80 - 448.76] P:1303.68 E:0.101023 |  So generally, if the other teams in your group draw,
[449.72 - 452.20] P:1288.93 E:0.107987 |  most teams would consider that to be a good thing.
[453.08 - 457.24] P:1478.09 E:0.099301 |  So Serbia with the ball on the edge of their own penalty area.
[457.24 - 459.88] P:1537.88 E:0.110846 |  Now, we do have a choice of listening, by the way, for you tonight.
[459.88 - 465.08] P:1539.67 E:0.096552 |  A really big night of sport because the US Open is coming to its climax.
[465.08 - 466.44] P:1482.56 E:0.091814 |  So that is the choice of listening.
[466.44 - 468.12] P:1756.76 E:0.086691 |  The Golf is on Sport Extra.
[468.12 - 471.80] P:1510.47 E:0.098757 |  Ian Carter is live in North Carolina and Rory McElroy,
[471.80 - 476.36] P:1625.38 E:0.091081 |  last a look, was two shots off the lead held by Bryson de Chambord.
[476.36 - 479.64] P:1406.83 E:0.084284 |  So Sport Extra for that on your digital radio.
[479.96 - 481.16] P:1322.10 E:0.095576 |  Via BBC Sound.
[482.20 - 483.96] P:1343.91 E:0.102775 |  Kyle Walker has it on the right-hand side.
[483.96 - 485.08] P:1325.11 E:0.094959 |  He has Alexander Arndle.
[485.08 - 488.68] P:1580.07 E:0.092075 |  Alexander Arndle lifts it right footed high out towards the left-hand side.
[488.68 - 490.76] P:1594.67 E:0.097293 |  Tribje knocks it back to the halfway line.
[490.76 - 495.16] P:1673.04 E:0.092017 |  Kieran Tribje, it's his 49th cap tonight for the Newcastle United now.
[495.72 - 499.56] P:1714.39 E:0.091627 |  Back to Mark Gay on the halfway line, winning his 12th cap.
[499.56 - 500.84] P:1713.75 E:0.101843 |  Cross it goes to John Storms.
[501.40 - 503.56] P:1602.38 E:0.099344 |  Started every match for Garith Southgate,
[503.56 - 505.16] P:1547.31 E:0.101431 |  that his tournament as a manager.
[505.72 - 508.84] P:1374.73 E:0.101944 |  Walker, then a pace and pass through to Jude Valinger.
[508.84 - 510.68] P:1239.39 E:0.111759 |  Now Saka's there on the right-hand side.
[511.48 - 513.40] P:1281.06 E:0.096244 |  Back to the halfway line, it goes.
[513.40 - 517.40] P:1306.74 E:0.093231 |  Serbia just content to sit and say to England,
[517.40 - 519.40] P:1327.52 E:0.096956 |  come on, how are you going to find a way through us?
[519.40 - 521.32] P:1481.59 E:0.104567 |  It's a sharp start by us with the ball though,
[521.32 - 523.40] P:1647.32 E:0.097032 |  I have to say, even though I had loads of possession,
[523.40 - 526.68] P:1608.68 E:0.106546 |  not massively penetrating, we're moving it about with a bit of purpose.
[526.68 - 529.56] P:1581.34 E:0.116884 |  Some nice crisp fast passes through the midfield area.
[530.76 - 532.76] P:1706.51 E:0.107275 |  Bukajosaka took on Kostić there.
[532.76 - 537.16] P:1348.06 E:0.096408 |  The ball deflected out of play and it was given as a throw-in to Serbia,
[537.80 - 541.16] P:1302.20 E:0.098460 |  which Bukajosaka certainly disputed,
[541.16 - 543.88] P:1478.70 E:0.089013 |  but it is a throw-in to Serbia.
[543.88 - 548.04] P:1399.02 E:0.097250 |  Dragan Stojkovic is Serbia, finished bottom of their group
[548.04 - 550.52] P:1187.89 E:0.095488 |  with just one point at the World Cup in Qatar.
[550.52 - 556.28] P:1562.13 E:0.088310 |  It's the first time Serbia have played at the Euros as just Serbia.
[556.28 - 558.52] P:1629.20 E:0.093682 |  I remember actually watching in this stadium,
[558.52 - 561.72] P:1393.56 E:0.092048 |  Serbia and Montenegro at the World Cup in 2006.
[561.72 - 564.12] P:1362.95 E:0.099154 |  Paul Joule was alongside me that day, I remember.
[564.84 - 571.24] P:1319.75 E:0.092714 |  Argentina won 6-0 and a young guy called Lionel Messi, I think it was,
[571.24 - 575.16] P:1472.14 E:0.092058 |  came on as a substitute as an 18-year-old
[575.16 - 577.40] P:1447.59 E:0.103274 |  and scored his first goal at a World Cup finals.
[578.20 - 580.60] P:1581.39 E:0.107889 |  Not sure what happened to him after that.
[580.60 - 581.80] P:1647.39 E:0.124093 |  Drizzled into obscurity.
[581.80 - 585.24] P:1795.86 E:0.101675 |  Obscurity, Bellingham wins a free kick,
[585.24 - 586.92] P:1591.14 E:0.098291 |  but Janiello Sarton says,
[586.92 - 589.24] P:1322.65 E:0.097404 |  you've taken it probably 10 yards away from where you should.
[589.24 - 591.88] P:1426.90 E:0.112898 |  Actually, no, he has allowed England to continue to play.
[591.88 - 595.08] P:1625.06 E:0.100535 |  Well, he's retiring, he can do that sort of thing.
[595.08 - 597.16] P:1695.84 E:0.093585 |  A little bit of grace.
[597.16 - 599.24] P:1500.39 E:0.095878 |  An England's attack down the right comes to nothing,
[599.24 - 601.56] P:1475.32 E:0.092840 |  that is cleared away by Pavlovic.
[601.56 - 604.04] P:1588.37 E:0.097675 |  Both kept in on the far side by Declan Rice.
[604.04 - 604.84] P:1633.37 E:0.100417 |  Actually, no, he didn't.
[604.84 - 607.48] P:1598.80 E:0.089112 |  It's a throw-in to Serbia, 10 yards inside their own half.
[607.48 - 609.08] P:1675.64 E:0.093488 |  So, eight minutes played.
[609.80 - 612.04] P:1375.29 E:0.091543 |  You and I have been talking, haven't we, Matt,
[612.04 - 614.92] P:1656.18 E:0.090017 |  about how important these first 15-20 minutes are?
[614.92 - 618.12] P:1614.08 E:0.096684 |  Yeah, they certainly are coming off the back of the last performance.
[618.12 - 620.60] P:1544.15 E:0.091535 |  I think to get that out of the system almost
[620.60 - 625.16] P:1572.10 E:0.094294 |  and to show what a top footballing team England are.
[625.16 - 627.56] P:1599.69 E:0.103317 |  And we started the game pretty well, to be honest.
[627.56 - 631.72] P:1665.55 E:0.092100 |  There's an energy and a purpose, and I feel quite assured, John,
[631.72 - 634.52] P:1758.94 E:0.080942 |  in terms of the body language, the players that's sharp,
[634.52 - 637.40] P:1518.23 E:0.091872 |  some nice passes going on through into Bellingham at the moment.
[637.40 - 639.16] P:1704.97 E:0.112500 |  That was a nice one from Guy, actually,
[639.16 - 642.36] P:1585.63 E:0.105547 |  through the middle to Bellingham, who had two Serbs either side of him,
[642.36 - 644.84] P:1695.38 E:0.097509 |  and they eased him all about, won the free kick.
[644.84 - 646.28] P:1532.32 E:0.101742 |  You've seen an awful lot of that, haven't we,
[646.28 - 647.40] P:1575.25 E:0.100363 |  in the latter half of the season,
[647.40 - 648.76] P:1430.46 E:0.100860 |  due to Bellingham winning free kicks.
[648.76 - 652.20] P:1432.98 E:0.094890 |  Yeah, definitely. It's the second pass that Guy has put into him as well.
[653.00 - 655.64] P:1584.71 E:0.089319 |  So, that's a nice little room through the midfield,
[655.64 - 657.00] P:1656.77 E:0.097646 |  into the feet of Jude Bellingham,
[657.00 - 660.28] P:1578.04 E:0.093858 |  and him keeping his composure when he's going to get fouled and fouled again,
[660.28 - 663.08] P:1653.63 E:0.081634 |  even in this game, I think keeping focus,
[663.08 - 665.40] P:1608.91 E:0.095228 |  keeping grounded is going to be important for Jude Bellingham.
[665.40 - 668.68] P:1749.44 E:0.101263 |  But, referee Osato got that right, he was having his shirt pulled by Lukic,
[668.68 - 670.60] P:1843.99 E:0.083725 |  the fuller man, free kick then tripped,
[670.60 - 672.36] P:1876.81 E:0.091004 |  he actually plays it square.
[672.36 - 674.20] P:1828.86 E:0.096611 |  So, central free kick to Walker,
[674.20 - 677.32] P:1698.96 E:0.097293 |  and Walker hits a high pass to the far side of the penalty area.
[677.32 - 680.12] P:1594.21 E:0.098950 |  Two men have gone down, and that's given us a free kick to Serbia,
[680.12 - 683.08] P:1800.57 E:0.085470 |  fouled by John Stones off the ball.
[683.08 - 686.60] P:1757.06 E:0.085132 |  Him and Mitrovic were just grappling in the corner of the box.
[686.60 - 688.04] P:1811.82 E:0.086226 |  John Stones steps into him.
[689.16 - 693.48] P:1507.94 E:0.090620 |  It does look like he's probably intentionally tried to block Mitrovic
[693.48 - 696.12] P:1655.93 E:0.091009 |  from going out to deal with the ball to Declan Rice,
[696.12 - 698.44] P:1541.63 E:0.092187 |  but Mitrovic goes down so easily.
[698.44 - 700.52] P:1512.74 E:0.095583 |  It's quite clever, actually, how he won that foul.
[701.24 - 703.16] P:1460.27 E:0.105527 |  Serbia nil, England nil.
[703.80 - 705.48] P:1648.62 E:0.109498 |  If you're in your car, if you're racing home,
[705.48 - 707.48] P:1687.32 E:0.095736 |  this match is on BBC One tonight.
[707.48 - 710.68] P:1500.15 E:0.095481 |  I think Guy Mowbray and Alan Shearer are in the commentary position,
[710.68 - 712.36] P:1642.54 E:0.096173 |  maybe two up behind us.
[713.00 - 715.96] P:1638.22 E:0.096013 |  But you can follow it across all the various platforms on the BBC,
[716.68 - 719.32] P:1629.91 E:0.089899 |  and you will need BBC Sounds for the Euros.
[719.32 - 723.16] P:1480.95 E:0.091253 |  If you haven't got it already, let me tell you, BBC Sounds will change your life.
[723.80 - 728.60] P:1395.70 E:0.091373 |  So, take my advice, and you can listen to Five Live and Sports Extra's coverage
[728.60 - 731.00] P:1514.00 E:0.089839 |  of all of the matches via BBC Sound.
[731.00 - 733.64] P:1371.83 E:0.099769 |  Rewind the live radio, listen back to the commentaries.
[733.64 - 738.52] P:1651.76 E:0.098936 |  And actually, for any BBC TV match, you can choose the Five Live commentary
[738.52 - 743.24] P:1466.71 E:0.096301 |  synced up with the pictures on the iPlayer or the BBC Sport website.
[743.24 - 746.04] P:1723.49 E:0.086830 |  Now, just look for Euros Extra.
[746.04 - 748.84] P:1739.52 E:0.094709 |  Listen on most smart speakers as well.
[748.84 - 750.36] P:1630.87 E:0.101086 |  They're absolutely everywhere.
[750.36 - 753.16] P:1615.91 E:0.099316 |  It's been great having it out here, having the German TV on,
[753.16 - 755.64] P:1590.27 E:0.093280 |  but then having the BBC Sounds commentary.
[755.64 - 756.76] P:1586.86 E:0.091120 |  Yep. Been enjoying that.
[756.76 - 757.88] P:1476.87 E:0.078229 |  Yep, we had that in the car.
[757.88 - 760.92] P:1455.70 E:0.096692 |  Here's Forden, Rice, England still dominating the possession.
[761.40 - 764.28] P:1392.63 E:0.085802 |  Rice, forced to give it back towards the halfway line.
[764.28 - 769.96] P:1601.95 E:0.090019 |  So, over 10 minutes played, and neither goalkeeper really has had anything to do.
[769.96 - 777.24] P:1428.83 E:0.089130 |  Rykovic in the Serbian goal, and Mallorca goalkeeper, or Jordan Pickford in the England goal.
[777.24 - 784.04] P:1426.51 E:0.094256 |  Jordan Pickford, who is tonight equaling Peter Shilton's record of 20 appearances
[784.04 - 787.88] P:1453.75 E:0.092382 |  by a goalkeeper at a World Cup or a European Championship.
[788.84 - 794.84] P:1232.59 E:0.099179 |  It's his 62nd cap, the England goalkeeper, the Everton player of the season.
[794.84 - 797.32] P:1004.12 E:0.090760 |  As England have it on the halfway line.
[797.32 - 799.64] P:1509.23 E:0.095099 |  Three times in a row, actually, Everton player of the season.
[799.64 - 801.48] P:1391.98 E:0.085668 |  Pickford himself pointed out the other day.
[801.48 - 804.60] P:1667.86 E:0.094880 |  He has Walker on the right-hand side, looking for the run of Saka.
[804.60 - 809.08] P:1771.86 E:0.105757 |  Good pass. Saka now with a chance to cross, and Balliom is there!
[809.08 - 811.80] P:1632.79 E:0.111314 |  With a header in the six-yard box.
[811.80 - 814.44] P:1534.83 E:0.117327 |  England take the lead.
[815.40 - 823.56] P:1419.78 E:0.111768 |  And it is that man who opens the door for England here in Gelsenkirchen.
[825.00 - 827.00] P:1680.25 E:0.125158 |  Jude Barragham, 20 years old.
[828.12 - 830.84] P:1538.96 E:0.121759 |  He's had the season of his life at Real Madrid.
[831.40 - 835.56] P:1466.48 E:0.116398 |  He punches the air now as he gets to his feet, with his teammates all around him.
[836.60 - 838.76] P:1451.36 E:0.111179 |  He's done it for Real Madrid.
[838.76 - 844.36] P:1478.68 E:0.113342 |  He's won the Champions League, and now he scores England's first goal here at Newell.
[844.68 - 849.80] P:1476.07 E:0.108427 |  In the 13th minute, Serbia nail England one.
[850.52 - 852.92] P:1589.62 E:0.116108 |  I just love everything about this goal.
[853.88 - 855.48] P:1645.48 E:0.119313 |  It has so much to it.
[856.52 - 859.96] P:1416.26 E:0.110669 |  It's not anything particularly clever at all.
[859.96 - 861.96] P:1593.65 E:0.105432 |  It's just really good play.
[861.96 - 863.96] P:1514.68 E:0.105897 |  Aggressive decision-making.
[863.96 - 868.20] P:1608.40 E:0.107749 |  Brilliant fall from Karl Walker inside the fallback to Pocayo Saka.
[868.20 - 873.08] P:1523.70 E:0.104336 |  He gets to the byline with his right foot, chops it back into the goal.
[873.16 - 876.44] P:1539.93 E:0.098108 |  It's got a bit of a wicked deflection the way it kicks up off the turf.
[876.44 - 878.92] P:1668.38 E:0.109025 |  But Jude Bellingham, how brave is he, by the way?
[878.92 - 881.00] P:1576.11 E:0.105757 |  He's aggressive. He wants to win this header.
[881.00 - 883.64] P:1563.16 E:0.101665 |  He gets there ahead of the covering, Serbia defender.
[883.64 - 885.40] P:1635.99 E:0.100822 |  And he just powers it into the back of the net.
[885.40 - 887.64] P:1619.16 E:0.099463 |  It's a brilliant header from Bellingham.
[887.64 - 888.68] P:1727.26 E:0.106318 |  Great move from England.
[889.32 - 891.64] P:1646.56 E:0.103973 |  Jude Bellingham makes the difference.
[892.60 - 895.16] P:1487.21 E:0.109964 |  And it's Serbia nail England one.
[896.44 - 898.84] P:1646.30 E:0.107040 |  And England, that's just the start that they wanted.
[898.84 - 902.44] P:1601.70 E:0.105672 |  Garis Selkir, I can tell you, is up off his seat, punching the air.
[902.52 - 903.64] P:1748.93 E:0.107968 |  And is he Christensen?
[903.64 - 907.08] P:1588.43 E:0.110381 |  Down behind the goal is very close to the England support.
[907.08 - 908.60] P:1681.00 E:0.115517 |  It's just behind you, is he, down there?
[909.24 - 911.40] P:1541.60 E:0.117673 |  Yeah, the England supporters, they've been loud.
[911.40 - 916.44] P:1558.46 E:0.104616 |  But when that ball at the back of the net, they have gone up another notch.
[916.44 - 917.56] P:1646.36 E:0.123916 |  The noise is electric.
[917.56 - 920.28] P:1555.47 E:0.113476 |  The fans right behind me here at the barrier,
[920.28 - 921.80] P:1587.01 E:0.111405 |  they started to climb onto the barrier.
[921.80 - 924.52] P:1763.03 E:0.096132 |  Their arms were in the air, just like Jordan Pickford.
[924.52 - 926.68] P:1638.46 E:0.122348 |  They turned around when the ball at the back of the net
[926.68 - 928.28] P:1621.15 E:0.118057 |  and spun his arms in the air.
[928.28 - 931.96] P:1558.59 E:0.111334 |  He came over to his water bottle and he had a real nice smile to the bench.
[931.96 - 935.08] P:1709.43 E:0.096526 |  There was a few other substitutes celebrating with him virtually.
[935.08 - 935.64] P:1281.88 E:0.127692 |  What a moment.
[937.32 - 938.84] P:1651.37 E:0.123095 |  So is he down behind the goal?
[938.84 - 940.60] P:1520.22 E:0.086946 |  Matt Upsons with me here.
[940.60 - 942.52] P:1611.28 E:0.110229 |  It is Serbia nail England one.
[943.08 - 948.84] P:1652.32 E:0.087065 |  And England able to produce the sort of decisive move, Matt, that
[950.28 - 952.44] P:1595.92 E:0.098575 |  any England fan will have wanted to see.
[952.44 - 954.20] P:1485.14 E:0.097333 |  Simplicity is class, John.
[954.20 - 957.24] P:1606.07 E:0.090407 |  And I think that move just speaks that, to be honest.
[957.24 - 958.44] P:1501.47 E:0.096787 |  It wasn't elaborate.
[958.44 - 961.08] P:1654.48 E:0.089939 |  It was a really good pass from Walker.
[961.08 - 964.84] P:1717.48 E:0.090163 |  Well timed run, trying to get in behind Serbia.
[964.84 - 967.96] P:1651.54 E:0.099210 |  We've become, in the last few games, a little bit too possession-based
[967.96 - 969.88] P:1595.99 E:0.088598 |  without much of that cutting.
[969.88 - 973.08] P:1513.72 E:0.098172 |  Everyone, enough of that cutting edge we've just seen there.
[973.08 - 974.68] P:1475.74 E:0.107119 |  Lovely early cross into the box.
[974.68 - 978.12] P:1582.55 E:0.105758 |  You've got a midfield player arriving right on cue in Bellingham
[978.12 - 980.76] P:1541.31 E:0.095202 |  and brilliant brave header just to get on the end of it.
[980.76 - 981.32] P:1557.38 E:0.106987 |  Super goal.
[982.04 - 986.52] P:1514.04 E:0.107277 |  Jude Bellingham with his 23 goals for Real Madrid this season.
[987.08 - 990.44] P:1302.83 E:0.104506 |  And now, last time he played for England, he scored that.
[991.24 - 995.32] P:1643.48 E:0.106085 |  Late equaliser in the friendly against Belgium in March.
[995.32 - 997.64] P:1527.09 E:0.117884 |  And here he is scoring the first goal of the tournament.
[997.64 - 1000.28] P:1512.78 E:0.110218 |  And it feels like history's repeated itself, Matt.
[1000.28 - 1003.88] P:1304.09 E:0.107920 |  When you and I were sitting in the stadium in Qatar
[1003.88 - 1006.60] P:1757.21 E:0.101014 |  and he scored England's first goal at the World Cup,
[1006.60 - 1008.60] P:1670.07 E:0.109633 |  now he's scored England's first goal at the Euro.
[1008.60 - 1009.56] P:1375.94 E:0.109783 |  It was a header as well, wasn't it?
[1009.56 - 1010.04] P:1461.88 E:0.112079 |  It was.
[1010.04 - 1011.08] P:1233.12 E:0.113735 |  It was a header as well.
[1011.08 - 1013.32] P:1345.62 E:0.101527 |  So, I mean, what can't he do, John?
[1014.20 - 1016.12] P:1453.73 E:0.095140 |  Anything on that pitch, what he cannot do?
[1016.12 - 1018.04] P:1475.84 E:0.106060 |  I mean, he's scoring headers, he can run,
[1018.04 - 1019.64] P:1570.91 E:0.093842 |  he's great with the ball at his feet.
[1019.64 - 1021.00] P:1341.19 E:0.094417 |  He's a model underpants.
[1022.20 - 1025.24] P:1597.58 E:0.104428 |  He can do absolutely what he likes.
[1025.24 - 1026.04] P:1327.05 E:0.056453 |  Anything.
[1026.04 - 1028.68] P:1362.35 E:0.093379 |  And when that goal was scored,
[1028.68 - 1035.16] P:1568.88 E:0.095594 |  Serbia had completed 12 passes in the match to England's 144.
[1036.84 - 1039.48] P:1392.45 E:0.101423 |  It's actually not that surprising, isn't it?
[1039.48 - 1042.04] P:1382.59 E:0.099169 |  No, no, but you've got to do something with it.
[1042.04 - 1044.20] P:1386.16 E:0.105533 |  You can't be content just having the ball.
[1044.20 - 1045.32] P:1489.24 E:0.108618 |  And England weren't there.
[1045.32 - 1048.76] P:1413.02 E:0.092760 |  They made a decisive move, positive decision-making,
[1048.84 - 1052.44] P:1479.79 E:0.099007 |  trying to hurt Serbia, getting behind them and it paid off.
[1052.44 - 1054.20] P:1272.10 E:0.098855 |  It was the walker pass.
[1054.20 - 1055.56] P:1292.33 E:0.107156 |  Yeah, that was the key to it.
[1055.56 - 1056.28] P:1231.24 E:0.091075 |  Yeah, it was.
[1056.28 - 1059.48] P:1260.40 E:0.085411 |  And Saka was onto it and he has Bellingham,
[1059.48 - 1060.92] P:1465.87 E:0.103968 |  who just glances the ball forward.
[1060.92 - 1063.80] P:1409.14 E:0.103537 |  Harry Kane, who's been involved in the match actually,
[1063.80 - 1066.76] P:1239.82 E:0.094952 |  Harry Kane, and Jude Bellingham now.
[1066.76 - 1070.44] P:1268.40 E:0.097038 |  So, as I say, for the second time scores the first goal
[1070.44 - 1072.20] P:1406.91 E:0.087329 |  at a big tournament for England.
[1072.20 - 1074.92] P:1437.50 E:0.097747 |  He has Alexander Arnold and now Saka,
[1074.92 - 1077.32] P:1287.74 E:0.111034 |  who will get an assist for that, Vakaya Saka.
[1078.04 - 1080.92] P:1331.55 E:0.108422 |  He's also so important to England for Kaya Saka,
[1080.92 - 1084.84] P:1437.45 E:0.091745 |  but he's barely been mentioned in the build-up to this World Cup.
[1084.84 - 1086.44] P:1597.04 E:0.094356 |  He was folding on the left-hand side.
[1086.44 - 1087.72] P:1601.45 E:0.073300 |  Trivia.
[1087.72 - 1089.48] P:1569.15 E:0.104609 |  It's across with his right foot as well, John, wasn't it?
[1089.48 - 1089.80] P:1534.49 E:0.112104 |  It was.
[1089.80 - 1090.92] P:1663.96 E:0.106447 |  Think it across with his right.
[1092.04 - 1095.56] P:1540.62 E:0.096814 |  And Bellingham has fouled.
[1096.68 - 1102.04] P:1467.07 E:0.092012 |  And he looks down at Zivkovic, who fouled him.
[1102.04 - 1105.16] P:1589.06 E:0.107556 |  He put his hands on his hips, he towers over him,
[1105.16 - 1106.28] P:1615.53 E:0.111528 |  and he looked down on him.
[1106.28 - 1108.60] P:1584.87 E:0.101301 |  It's up to Ziv to say, what are you doing?
[1108.60 - 1111.24] P:1546.23 E:0.099072 |  Just a look to say, don't do that again, son.
[1111.24 - 1112.12] P:1345.35 E:0.093671 |  Don't do that again, son.
[1113.48 - 1116.04] P:1679.98 E:0.105619 |  So, England have got the early goal.
[1116.04 - 1118.92] P:1752.66 E:0.094994 |  And actually, in all four of Garra Southgate's tournaments now,
[1119.88 - 1124.04] P:1674.73 E:0.095432 |  England have taken the lead in the first half of their first match.
[1125.16 - 1127.88] P:1500.52 E:0.091631 |  And three wins out of three so far,
[1127.88 - 1129.40] P:1338.76 E:0.094634 |  and that's the early goal that they've won.
[1129.40 - 1131.16] P:1425.89 E:0.101609 |  I mean, you spoke to me yesterday, Garra Southgate,
[1131.16 - 1134.36] P:1370.22 E:0.089460 |  about the fact that Germany had made such a strong start.
[1134.36 - 1138.52] P:1404.59 E:0.097915 |  Spain had made a strong start just before I spoke to him, actually, yesterday.
[1138.52 - 1139.88] P:1404.14 E:0.107825 |  You know, England took note of that,
[1140.68 - 1142.92] P:1430.03 E:0.103924 |  and really wanted to try and do something similar.
[1142.92 - 1143.96] P:1556.60 E:0.105735 |  You feeling a bit more relaxed?
[1144.52 - 1145.96] P:1437.12 E:0.097643 |  I have to say, yes, good.
[1147.00 - 1152.44] P:1263.37 E:0.103352 |  Here is Velkovic on the halfway line, passes it up to Vlavic,
[1152.44 - 1155.88] P:1558.69 E:0.092131 |  but in comes the tackle there from Mark Gay,
[1155.88 - 1158.52] P:1673.89 E:0.108986 |  and now Foden has a chance to carry the ball in field.
[1158.52 - 1159.56] P:1845.31 E:0.093854 |  They're trying to catch him.
[1159.56 - 1160.92] P:1783.81 E:0.109093 |  He gives it to Alexander-Arnold,
[1160.92 - 1163.72] P:1820.59 E:0.104476 |  who shoots from the edge of the area, but miss-hit it, really.
[1163.72 - 1167.00] P:1742.00 E:0.096951 |  And it bounce well way to the target by four or five yards,
[1167.00 - 1169.96] P:1698.97 E:0.080800 |  just watching Jude Bellingham, who's still on the ground,
[1169.96 - 1171.48] P:1616.72 E:0.090703 |  just claiming to his feet now,
[1172.04 - 1175.00] P:1409.61 E:0.097862 |  and Daniele Orsato has run all the way across.
[1175.64 - 1177.80] P:1443.96 E:0.095608 |  And I think there's a suggestion there from Bellingham
[1177.80 - 1181.72] P:1566.59 E:0.088548 |  that he was caught by an arm of Vlavic.
[1181.72 - 1183.00] P:1671.34 E:0.096614 |  Yeah, from Vlavic.
[1183.00 - 1186.20] P:1653.50 E:0.096973 |  I mean, I think he does leave his forearm out there a little bit
[1186.20 - 1188.20] P:1619.12 E:0.102522 |  and catch his Bellingham in the side of the head.
[1188.20 - 1190.92] P:1495.36 E:0.093074 |  The contact isn't a particularly hefty blow,
[1190.92 - 1192.20] P:1550.35 E:0.096531 |  but he still clipped him.
[1192.20 - 1195.80] P:1567.01 E:0.086929 |  And I think Jude Bellingham just making that point to the referee.
[1195.80 - 1197.96] P:1674.25 E:0.105931 |  But that piece of pressure was started by Mark Gay.
[1198.76 - 1202.20] P:1530.80 E:0.102147 |  Being quite brave, going in deep, going all the way in with Vlavic,
[1202.20 - 1204.92] P:1588.11 E:0.094181 |  and just putting him under pressure to win the ball back.
[1204.92 - 1206.28] P:1604.29 E:0.092152 |  He started really brightly, Gay.
[1206.28 - 1208.28] P:1392.53 E:0.083285 |  He actually really confident start from him.
[1209.88 - 1213.40] P:1626.17 E:0.108572 |  So England lead through Jude Bellingham's fourth goal for England.
[1213.40 - 1217.32] P:1764.47 E:0.087122 |  It's his 30th cap here in Gelsenkirchen,
[1217.32 - 1219.80] P:1569.67 E:0.101368 |  where I can see the Sun is shining,
[1219.88 - 1224.52] P:1489.66 E:0.100266 |  glinting on the white metalwork of the roof of the arena, Alkšalka.
[1225.24 - 1229.40] P:1687.39 E:0.100657 |  That's a poor pass actually by John Stones for Wauke.
[1230.12 - 1232.84] P:1634.69 E:0.080101 |  And he couldn't keep it in play,
[1232.84 - 1235.16] P:1611.56 E:0.096207 |  and it's out of play for a throw into Serbia,
[1235.16 - 1236.68] P:1314.97 E:0.094659 |  halfway inside the England half.
[1237.32 - 1240.28] P:1352.19 E:0.104737 |  This stadium, I remember coming here shortly after it had opened,
[1240.28 - 1243.24] P:1444.94 E:0.098894 |  and it's got a big cube that hangs above the centre-circle
[1243.24 - 1246.04] P:1362.81 E:0.077027 |  with big screens on it.
[1246.04 - 1248.44] P:1548.92 E:0.103304 |  And so actually the match is being shown up there as well
[1249.08 - 1251.16] P:1841.44 E:0.111876 |  to all four sides of the stadium.
[1251.16 - 1253.96] P:1909.00 E:0.107618 |  Vlavic now is well challenged by Gay,
[1253.96 - 1256.04] P:1717.01 E:0.108674 |  but that's given away by Alexander-Arnold.
[1256.04 - 1260.36] P:1750.17 E:0.102682 |  He has Mitrovic shooting wide, Serbia's first chance.
[1260.36 - 1262.12] P:1764.58 E:0.096287 |  Tickford diving to his left.
[1262.12 - 1264.20] P:1658.03 E:0.099701 |  I'm not sure he would have got there,
[1264.20 - 1268.28] P:1661.18 E:0.111705 |  and it was well hit by Mitrovic, but wide by probably inches.
[1268.84 - 1270.52] P:1676.53 E:0.104969 |  Oh, got away with one there.
[1270.52 - 1273.08] P:1793.85 E:0.101790 |  Trent Alexander-Arnold doesn't get the ball under control.
[1273.64 - 1275.48] P:1849.41 E:0.097316 |  I mean, Mitrovic takes it so early.
[1276.44 - 1278.52] P:1575.01 E:0.104994 |  He just has a loose touch, Alexander-Arnold.
[1278.52 - 1281.64] P:1700.68 E:0.094268 |  It really bounces off his shin as he's chasing it.
[1281.64 - 1284.28] P:1629.38 E:0.098537 |  Ricochet's back to Mitrovic, and he takes it so early.
[1284.28 - 1285.80] P:1432.43 E:0.083368 |  Just blazes it wide.
[1285.80 - 1287.80] P:1610.06 E:0.076171 |  Yeah, it must have flashed.
[1287.80 - 1290.28] P:1626.86 E:0.105279 |  Just past you, is he, behind the goal there?
[1290.28 - 1291.56] P:1577.80 E:0.086174 |  Yeah, it was very, very close.
[1291.56 - 1294.60] P:1577.46 E:0.096012 |  He hit it with some serious, forced it, Alexander Mitrovic.
[1294.60 - 1296.68] P:1618.76 E:0.115319 |  But it's just come a little bit sloppy from England,
[1296.68 - 1299.08] P:1626.45 E:0.111202 |  and just watching Jordan Pickford's body language,
[1299.08 - 1301.16] P:1714.02 E:0.117847 |  he is so on it, he is so sharp.
[1301.16 - 1303.72] P:1740.24 E:0.114409 |  He absolutely hammered John Stones for passing the ball out
[1303.72 - 1304.76] P:1822.43 E:0.095485 |  a play a moment ago.
[1304.84 - 1306.68] P:1856.06 E:0.109871 |  And John Stones has actually just signalled to him,
[1306.68 - 1308.20] P:1813.98 E:0.088329 |  giving him the thumbs up to say,
[1308.20 - 1310.36] P:1690.39 E:0.100173 |  stay on my back, mate, because we need to be on it.
[1310.36 - 1312.44] P:1736.53 E:0.078871 |  They can't give Serbia a sniffy yet.
[1312.44 - 1315.32] P:1607.86 E:0.078632 |  Yep, yep. That's excellent.
[1316.28 - 1319.40] P:1506.84 E:0.093696 |  Excellent insight from down there, from Izzy.
[1319.40 - 1321.80] P:1520.32 E:0.099808 |  And Matt up here, we're watching Bukaj Osaka
[1321.80 - 1323.40] P:1683.24 E:0.103246 |  winning a free kick for England.
[1324.04 - 1327.16] P:1722.92 E:0.095769 |  And this is 30 yards out, right of centre.
[1327.96 - 1331.48] P:1509.77 E:0.101955 |  So Alexander-Arnold is there again as well.
[1331.48 - 1333.08] P:1557.95 E:0.091446 |  Foulding just to his right,
[1333.08 - 1335.72] P:1543.29 E:0.081982 |  Jordan standing with his hands on his hips.
[1335.72 - 1339.00] P:1636.59 E:0.100060 |  Alexander-Arnold just puts his left foot next to the ball
[1339.00 - 1341.96] P:1762.07 E:0.110565 |  and then takes two, three strides back.
[1343.40 - 1345.72] P:1805.78 E:0.114472 |  It is Trent Alexander-Arnold with the free kick.
[1345.72 - 1347.24] P:1738.36 E:0.106953 |  That bounces down and hits Rice.
[1348.28 - 1351.48] P:1550.69 E:0.103080 |  I think it might have been glanced by a defender into his midriff.
[1351.48 - 1352.68] P:1346.58 E:0.104655 |  And before he knew what had happened,
[1352.68 - 1354.28] P:1586.30 E:0.106448 |  the ball had bounced straight through
[1354.28 - 1355.88] P:1639.55 E:0.096390 |  and behind the far post for a goal kick.
[1355.88 - 1358.04] P:1690.55 E:0.110811 |  Yeah, I mean, I think one of the deckland feels
[1358.04 - 1358.76] P:1495.53 E:0.110386 |  he's going to get the ball.
[1358.76 - 1360.04] P:1744.06 E:0.111985 |  Not even sure there was a touch.
[1360.12 - 1365.32] P:1442.08 E:0.095191 |  He just took him completely by surprise, hits him in the shoulder.
[1365.32 - 1366.60] P:1699.91 E:0.101171 |  He's got no time to react,
[1366.60 - 1368.52] P:1666.99 E:0.095810 |  and the ball just rolls out of play for a goal kick.
[1368.52 - 1372.12] P:1655.48 E:0.094703 |  But, you know, that right foot of Alexander-Arnold,
[1372.12 - 1374.44] P:1617.07 E:0.093194 |  I mean, it was quite a narrow free kick, wasn't it?
[1374.44 - 1376.92] P:1458.81 E:0.093128 |  But he's able to wrap his foot around it
[1376.92 - 1379.88] P:1580.34 E:0.094399 |  and get that angle, almost create an angle,
[1379.88 - 1383.88] P:1452.93 E:0.094526 |  to put a really good delivery into the box for players to go and attack.
[1383.88 - 1387.72] P:1333.43 E:0.095422 |  Serbia nil, England 1-5 live, BBC sounds.
[1387.80 - 1391.56] P:1287.37 E:0.095883 |  Here's Trebjav, towers above Zivkovic.
[1392.52 - 1394.92] P:1371.59 E:0.101999 |  Great spring from him to head it forward.
[1394.92 - 1396.28] P:1215.50 E:0.100753 |  Trebjav playing as the left back.
[1396.28 - 1398.84] P:1432.78 E:0.105664 |  Lukasjord is on the bench for this match, incidentally.
[1398.84 - 1402.84] P:1446.08 E:0.102384 |  Vlavaj just crossfield passes, easily cut out by Kyle Walker,
[1402.84 - 1405.32] P:1399.43 E:0.097755 |  who has the ball on the edge of his box, plays it back to Pickford.
[1405.32 - 1408.28] P:1230.06 E:0.093799 |  Pickford pulls it under his left foot and then hits it long,
[1408.28 - 1410.92] P:1431.79 E:0.100134 |  high up towards the goal scorer, Jude Bellingham.
[1410.92 - 1413.64] P:1393.38 E:0.083012 |  I think he's got a shove in the back there from Valkovic.
[1414.36 - 1417.88] P:1355.02 E:0.088192 |  That's Serbia with Zivkovic will actually knock it back
[1417.88 - 1419.24] P:1400.72 E:0.106086 |  towards the edge of the penalty area,
[1419.24 - 1423.48] P:1556.35 E:0.093968 |  to the rugged figure of Nikola Milenkovic.
[1424.44 - 1427.08] P:1329.12 E:0.089112 |  And then back to Golgipa, Rijkovic,
[1427.08 - 1429.24] P:1288.48 E:0.093372 |  left footed from him up towards Mitrovic,
[1429.24 - 1430.84] P:1564.78 E:0.111755 |  Dusan Tadec on the bench.
[1430.84 - 1433.24] P:1697.84 E:0.107853 |  And Declan Reis is dispossessed.
[1433.24 - 1436.52] P:1771.01 E:0.104031 |  Now Vlavaj on the edge of the area, Vlavaj is shot, blocked by Gea.
[1436.52 - 1440.20] P:1692.14 E:0.093607 |  You've got his left leg in the way of that, bounced out to Saka.
[1440.20 - 1443.24] P:1621.69 E:0.105430 |  And Serbia have committed men downfield here.
[1443.64 - 1445.00] P:1584.35 E:0.103934 |  And that means there could be spaces,
[1445.00 - 1446.84] P:1597.47 E:0.103243 |  but Foden passed the ball behind Saka.
[1446.84 - 1448.44] P:1596.07 E:0.099251 |  So Serbia have got it back now,
[1448.44 - 1450.52] P:1623.21 E:0.102534 |  and it is Serbia who will come forward with Kostić.
[1450.52 - 1455.24] P:1546.69 E:0.083942 |  The Juventus left wing back as he is in this Serbian line-up.
[1455.24 - 1457.88] P:1600.71 E:0.102382 |  Dragan Stukovic has used back three, back four,
[1457.88 - 1460.44] P:1671.54 E:0.109865 |  but it is a three-central defenders today,
[1460.44 - 1462.52] P:1644.80 E:0.108343 |  and then Kostić concedes the throw.
[1462.52 - 1468.04] P:1640.50 E:0.104953 |  And Jude Bellingham has just had a little set to with Kostić.
[1468.04 - 1469.80] P:1618.30 E:0.097671 |  Bellingham actually just turned his back on him,
[1469.80 - 1472.28] P:1464.83 E:0.091522 |  walked away from him, and Kostić chased after him.
[1472.28 - 1475.80] P:1395.72 E:0.102821 |  I think he gets in his face a little bit just before that,
[1475.80 - 1477.48] P:1691.89 E:0.099984 |  whether or not he's just getting up to the crowd,
[1477.48 - 1480.92] P:1701.94 E:0.091697 |  he just drops a little shoulder into Kostić's chest.
[1480.92 - 1483.80] P:1541.25 E:0.091970 |  I can understand why he's had a little pop at him there, John.
[1483.80 - 1485.32] P:1596.59 E:0.083946 |  Bellingham really is on it.
[1485.32 - 1486.76] P:1740.89 E:0.097286 |  I mean, he's the one pressuring there.
[1486.76 - 1488.12] P:1630.08 E:0.089742 |  He shuts the ball down.
[1488.12 - 1489.88] P:1452.96 E:0.073978 |  He's pumped for this game, Jude Bellingham.
[1489.88 - 1491.08] P:1527.57 E:0.068631 |  Yeah, you can see that.
[1491.96 - 1496.12] P:1527.61 E:0.102092 |  And that could have happened in any era, couldn't it?
[1496.12 - 1496.68] P:1579.03 E:0.102580 |  It could.
[1496.68 - 1500.20] P:1628.30 E:0.104317 |  That little exchange between the two of them.
[1500.20 - 1501.80] P:1639.82 E:0.105267 |  It's great to see, John, if I'm honest.
[1501.80 - 1503.40] P:1836.78 E:0.106177 |  I mean, you want to see that kind of energy
[1503.40 - 1505.32] P:1747.29 E:0.100979 |  and passion in the game of this size.
[1505.32 - 1508.68] P:1660.13 E:0.094488 |  And I think England have started with that in their game.
[1508.68 - 1511.64] P:1464.36 E:0.088110 |  You can tell that the players are really wired into it.
[1511.64 - 1515.16] P:1553.57 E:0.084968 |  Garry Southgate will want them to press on from here,
[1515.16 - 1518.68] P:1690.74 E:0.091337 |  just like Spain and Germany did in their opening matches, though.
[1518.68 - 1521.40] P:1632.11 E:0.095767 |  And Serbia just showing a little more at the moment.
[1521.40 - 1522.44] P:1675.94 E:0.106656 |  They are 1-0 down.
[1523.00 - 1526.12] P:1774.84 E:0.095771 |  But it is in the forward areas where their talents are.
[1526.12 - 1529.72] P:1650.14 E:0.107241 |  But Glavic's Crossfield pass is cut out by Alexander-Arnold.
[1529.72 - 1531.56] P:1616.09 E:0.109526 |  Now Saka plays it for De Walker.
[1531.56 - 1533.16] P:1798.29 E:0.113920 |  Walker speeding into the area.
[1533.16 - 1537.08] P:1698.67 E:0.108478 |  Walker goes for goal, and it's all the way across the six-yard box.
[1537.08 - 1541.32] P:1663.30 E:0.097753 |  There were men in there, Kane, Foden and Alexander-Arnold,
[1541.32 - 1543.88] P:1694.21 E:0.097309 |  but none of them could get a touch to it,
[1543.88 - 1546.04] P:1669.91 E:0.107568 |  and it rolled right across the goal and away.
[1546.04 - 1549.08] P:1699.26 E:0.115367 |  Well, that is the steam train that Kyle Walker is
[1549.08 - 1550.36] P:1642.23 E:0.110398 |  when he gets on the overlap.
[1550.36 - 1553.16] P:1619.73 E:0.094942 |  There is no stopping this guy at any age.
[1553.80 - 1557.08] P:1596.46 E:0.091662 |  He makes it, but it's almost a cross-cum-shot.
[1557.08 - 1557.64] P:1621.82 E:0.076468 |  It's neither.
[1558.28 - 1561.32] P:1615.75 E:0.099380 |  He kind of originally sees the angle that he could have a shot
[1561.64 - 1565.56] P:1670.74 E:0.087607 |  at goal, then realises it's too tight, and then the cross isn't quite cut back enough
[1565.56 - 1569.72] P:1676.02 E:0.093164 |  for anyone to finish, and it rolls agonisingly in that gully of space
[1569.72 - 1571.48] P:1784.33 E:0.093679 |  where no-one is, and just wide.
[1571.48 - 1573.80] P:1528.64 E:0.089987 |  What a great opportunity to put a second in.
[1573.80 - 1575.80] P:1486.14 E:0.090004 |  Yes, it was. He scored in the qualifying campaign.
[1575.80 - 1577.88] P:1541.95 E:0.075029 |  Do you remember that one in Rotswaf?
[1577.88 - 1584.84] P:1467.43 E:0.083223 |  It's his only goal for England, which came in what was his 77th appearance.
[1584.84 - 1585.96] P:1400.55 E:0.101119 |  And here he is now, Walker.
[1585.96 - 1587.96] P:1622.62 E:0.102625 |  This is his 84th for England.
[1588.60 - 1590.68] P:1395.43 E:0.112597 |  And big opportunity, really.
[1591.72 - 1592.20] P:1196.64 E:0.092376 |  Massive.
[1592.20 - 1593.48] P:1381.85 E:0.100061 |  I mean, it was a brink.
[1593.48 - 1596.76] P:1499.77 E:0.089176 |  Whenever Serbia want to come out, they're in trouble.
[1597.32 - 1600.12] P:1287.18 E:0.089731 |  I think with that good when we win the ball back,
[1600.12 - 1603.00] P:1517.40 E:0.104613 |  finding that one or two passes off, and then we've got a runner,
[1603.00 - 1604.92] P:1500.70 E:0.102753 |  the space is there, and the pace we've got,
[1605.96 - 1607.96] P:1265.52 E:0.117383 |  it's going to kill them if they do expose themselves.
[1607.96 - 1610.28] P:1278.21 E:0.107800 |  They've got to really balance it correctly, Serbia.
[1610.28 - 1612.20] P:1517.27 E:0.114029 |  Otherwise England, I think, are really going to get out.
[1612.92 - 1615.08] P:1412.05 E:0.102495 |  25 minutes played.
[1615.08 - 1617.08] P:1415.75 E:0.090588 |  Serbia nil, England won.
[1617.08 - 1620.04] P:1712.12 E:0.098090 |  At the US Open, Rory McElroy, two shots off the lead.
[1620.60 - 1623.24] P:1632.81 E:0.101453 |  So you can hear that right now on Sport Extra.
[1623.96 - 1629.00] P:1580.27 E:0.089560 |  But here on Five Live as will be the case over the course of the next month.
[1629.64 - 1632.52] P:1810.36 E:0.105069 |  It is the Euros, all the top summer sport.
[1633.08 - 1636.84] P:1858.38 E:0.099632 |  And the general election as well.
[1636.84 - 1638.76] P:1735.69 E:0.098699 |  Not to mention the T20, incidentally.
[1639.32 - 1641.88] P:1681.46 E:0.106106 |  And we now know that England's first match in the Super 8
[1641.88 - 1644.76] P:1329.29 E:0.100416 |  will be in the early hours of Thursday morning
[1644.76 - 1647.16] P:1482.78 E:0.088201 |  against the West Indies in St Lucia.
[1647.16 - 1650.28] P:1377.75 E:0.102987 |  So Five Live the place, Sport Extra, the place to listen to that
[1650.28 - 1652.36] P:1351.61 E:0.098255 |  in the early hours of Thursday morning.
[1652.36 - 1655.08] P:1418.98 E:0.110636 |  One nil England lead, but the ball inside their own penalty area.
[1655.08 - 1658.60] P:1362.76 E:0.085277 |  Back to Jordan Pigford, all in green.
[1658.60 - 1661.80] P:1591.35 E:0.110498 |  Long and left-handed from him, Harry Kane is wrestling.
[1662.44 - 1666.04] P:1682.35 E:0.105695 |  Milenkovic says referee Osato.
[1666.04 - 1668.52] P:1483.59 E:0.099699 |  Kane feels that he was being fouled by the big number four,
[1668.52 - 1669.80] P:1550.01 E:0.075782 |  but the free kick's gone.
[1669.80 - 1670.60] P:1598.31 E:0.089420 |  Serbia as well.
[1670.60 - 1672.60] P:1549.73 E:0.092491 |  Yeah, I mean, he's a big lad as well, isn't he?
[1672.60 - 1674.04] P:1527.38 E:0.094238 |  Milenkovic, I think, six foot five.
[1675.00 - 1679.32] P:1496.27 E:0.084144 |  Harry Kane, who rather kind of unselfishly hasn't been heavily
[1679.32 - 1680.12] P:1343.74 E:0.109325 |  involved in this game.
[1680.12 - 1683.80] P:1577.36 E:0.096999 |  He's just been trying to occupy, I think, the back three.
[1683.80 - 1686.60] P:1494.35 E:0.095461 |  Certainly Milenkovic, the middle of the back three,
[1686.60 - 1688.20] P:1607.97 E:0.090408 |  the big six foot five centre back.
[1688.76 - 1691.56] P:1742.77 E:0.099264 |  He's just been occupying him and just trying to create that space
[1691.56 - 1696.92] P:1428.62 E:0.087726 |  for Bellingham, for Foden to get into in typical unselfish Harry Kane style.
[1697.80 - 1698.92] P:1250.65 E:0.092789 |  That's Matt Upsen.
[1698.92 - 1701.08] P:1370.28 E:0.103391 |  Is it Christensen's down behind the goal?
[1701.08 - 1703.00] P:1484.74 E:0.095169 |  It's Serbia nil England won.
[1703.08 - 1706.44] P:1481.36 E:0.097710 |  And Serbia have got the ball halfway inside their own half.
[1707.24 - 1710.28] P:1403.33 E:0.107605 |  So, one-one in the earlier match between Slovenia and Denmark.
[1710.92 - 1715.08] P:1423.26 E:0.096327 |  England's next match is on Thursday, and it's the middle match,
[1715.08 - 1718.68] P:1556.26 E:0.087871 |  so it'll be a five o'clock kickoff UK time against Denmark.
[1718.68 - 1721.64] P:1555.94 E:0.095485 |  He has rice near the halfway line, Trippie.
[1721.64 - 1724.76] P:1725.12 E:0.104575 |  And then Jude Bellingham commanding, really,
[1724.76 - 1727.56] P:1679.46 E:0.093481 |  the way that Bellingham just moves onto the ball there.
[1727.56 - 1730.76] P:1542.60 E:0.083512 |  And even though it's a simple thing, he just, with his right foot,
[1730.84 - 1733.00] P:1531.88 E:0.092620 |  unhearingly finds his target.
[1733.00 - 1736.28] P:1394.47 E:0.086228 |  He's got this kind of bouncing strut when he comes off of it.
[1736.28 - 1740.04] P:1466.06 E:0.091640 |  It's like such a confident little jog away from those moments, isn't it?
[1740.04 - 1743.64] P:1573.17 E:0.091507 |  And then he's, like, adjusting his position, head on the swivel,
[1744.20 - 1745.56] P:1415.20 E:0.099692 |  wanting to get on the ball again.
[1745.56 - 1746.28] P:1351.51 E:0.057829 |  I mean, he's...
[1746.28 - 1750.92] P:1435.51 E:0.088159 |  I've said before, Matt, it's got a little bit of Brian Robson about it, I feel.
[1751.96 - 1753.72] P:1665.25 E:0.111695 |  In terms of that kind of strut.
[1753.72 - 1754.84] P:1724.94 E:0.103809 |  It comes up exactly what you say.
[1755.56 - 1758.04] P:1451.91 E:0.087318 |  It's just that it oozes confidence, doesn't it?
[1758.04 - 1759.32] P:1347.58 E:0.106304 |  Yes, Alexander-Arnold.
[1759.32 - 1761.40] P:1808.56 E:0.110675 |  Lovely ball over the top to Saka.
[1761.40 - 1762.92] P:1758.68 E:0.101247 |  Saka has two men with him.
[1762.92 - 1765.40] P:1654.87 E:0.099630 |  Ball bounces for Saka inside the penalty area.
[1765.40 - 1766.36] P:1436.93 E:0.102882 |  Now on the edge of the box.
[1766.36 - 1767.24] P:1593.23 E:0.100638 |  Bellingham is there.
[1767.24 - 1769.08] P:1664.99 E:0.105204 |  Little touch back to Alexander-Arnold.
[1769.08 - 1770.68] P:1733.26 E:0.103024 |  Excellent change of feet.
[1770.68 - 1773.72] P:1693.59 E:0.117453 |  He easily beat Milenkovich, who came...
[1775.24 - 1777.96] P:1749.08 E:0.102712 |  Who came rattling in, Milenkovich.
[1777.96 - 1781.16] P:1516.48 E:0.091712 |  And Alexander-Arnold knew exactly what he was doing.
[1781.16 - 1782.12] P:1649.31 E:0.105936 |  It was Goodell, actually.
[1782.12 - 1783.48] P:1686.96 E:0.106088 |  Goodell, who went sliding in.
[1784.52 - 1786.92] P:1558.42 E:0.092568 |  And Alexander-Arnold, just too quick.
[1786.92 - 1787.72] P:1607.05 E:0.095918 |  Feet were too quick.
[1787.72 - 1788.52] P:1813.55 E:0.088989 |  Lovely, wasn't it?
[1788.52 - 1790.20] P:1605.71 E:0.091780 |  Shift from right foot to left.
[1790.20 - 1793.24] P:1652.94 E:0.080635 |  Just that little quick pop of the ball draws the foul,
[1793.24 - 1794.84] P:1589.92 E:0.091157 |  and this is an interesting distance, John.
[1796.12 - 1797.40] P:1686.29 E:0.084409 |  It certainly is.
[1797.40 - 1801.48] P:1623.39 E:0.092404 |  This is probably not quite 25 yards.
[1801.48 - 1802.44] P:1471.61 E:0.086048 |  It's right of centre.
[1802.44 - 1804.12] P:1553.86 E:0.102189 |  I've seen Harry Kane hit them from here before,
[1804.12 - 1810.12] P:1545.71 E:0.085654 |  but Alexander-Arnold and Trippier and Thornton are all together around the ball.
[1810.76 - 1812.52] P:1520.62 E:0.095985 |  Probably the wrong side for Trippier.
[1813.96 - 1816.12] P:1465.40 E:0.109817 |  But let's see what they've got in mind.
[1816.20 - 1818.28] P:1530.97 E:0.102458 |  They've got their set piece specialist England.
[1818.28 - 1819.64] P:1533.11 E:0.111496 |  They've had one for years.
[1819.64 - 1821.48] P:1398.13 E:0.093222 |  They were ahead of the curve with that,
[1821.48 - 1825.72] P:1371.08 E:0.100537 |  as Gareth Southgate was pulling me up on a few months ago.
[1826.76 - 1830.68] P:1459.95 E:0.096559 |  And referee Osato says, I think, he's saying the England...
[1830.68 - 1832.36] P:1661.66 E:0.110899 |  Oh, no, he's saying get the ball on the pitch.
[1832.36 - 1833.72] P:1746.42 E:0.094996 |  Any chance of getting the ball on the grass?
[1833.72 - 1837.32] P:1574.16 E:0.103988 |  Yeah, which Alexander-Arnold was holding the ball.
[1839.00 - 1839.64] P:1699.54 E:0.142923 |  So it is.
[1839.64 - 1841.48] P:1642.24 E:0.112183 |  It looks as though it's going to be Alexander-Arnold,
[1841.48 - 1843.64] P:1752.36 E:0.104490 |  but they're making Serbia a thing here.
[1845.16 - 1845.72] P:1813.11 E:0.121293 |  Trippier.
[1845.80 - 1847.88] P:1693.96 E:0.106175 |  And now they're fiddling about again.
[1847.88 - 1850.60] P:1688.51 E:0.107317 |  I think Saka's just lurking in that wide position,
[1850.60 - 1852.44] P:1604.18 E:0.100736 |  ready for a little slip to pass, you feel?
[1852.44 - 1854.84] P:1728.35 E:0.110325 |  I think Serbia, one eye on that, they're going to play it short.
[1855.48 - 1857.80] P:1709.72 E:0.111124 |  Well, it's had the big build-up, this one, no mistake.
[1857.80 - 1859.16] P:1855.65 E:0.105914 |  Trippier walks away.
[1859.16 - 1861.56] P:1759.21 E:0.117852 |  Alexander-Arnold is ready, but it could be Thornton.
[1862.44 - 1865.40] P:1813.96 E:0.115675 |  Alexander-Arnold, the wall just inside the Serbia box.
[1865.40 - 1868.36] P:1807.11 E:0.103559 |  Alexander-Arnold hits the wall, bounces out,
[1868.36 - 1871.64] P:1704.50 E:0.102284 |  only half-clear away, comes back to Alexander-Arnold,
[1871.64 - 1874.28] P:1557.17 E:0.093334 |  and then Trippier passes slightly behind him.
[1874.28 - 1877.48] P:1677.68 E:0.094149 |  So Trippier actually has to roll the ball all the way back to Pickford,
[1877.48 - 1878.68] P:1578.35 E:0.087025 |  and it comes to nothing.
[1878.68 - 1881.48] P:1602.32 E:0.101598 |  Very often it does when you see the big build-up.
[1881.48 - 1882.84] P:1463.47 E:0.079059 |  The big build-up, yeah.
[1882.84 - 1884.04] P:1552.29 E:0.094894 |  Unconvincing, wasn't it?
[1884.04 - 1887.72] P:1692.42 E:0.091309 |  I don't think in the end, I'm not sure if Trent Alexander-Arnold
[1887.72 - 1888.92] P:1779.64 E:0.115029 |  really quite knew what he was doing,
[1888.92 - 1890.84] P:1729.10 E:0.109833 |  but Jude Bellingham knows what he's doing.
[1890.84 - 1891.56] P:1583.43 E:0.091799 |  Doesn't he, Chas?
[1891.56 - 1894.36] P:1473.75 E:0.100081 |  With that, he just hit it across the window.
[1894.36 - 1897.24] P:1744.77 E:0.095116 |  A crossfield pass, which I think our microphones
[1897.24 - 1899.32] P:1783.48 E:0.106672 |  actually picked up the noise of that, didn't it?
[1899.32 - 1899.64] P:1781.05 E:0.084656 |  The foot.
[1899.64 - 1902.04] P:1727.11 E:0.106476 |  It was sort of splat as he hit it.
[1902.04 - 1903.72] P:1594.08 E:0.106945 |  Here's Saka on the right-hand side.
[1903.72 - 1905.40] P:1774.55 E:0.108694 |  Saka takes on his man to the byline.
[1905.40 - 1907.40] P:1758.08 E:0.093983 |  Right-footed cross, comes off the head of a defender,
[1907.40 - 1911.80] P:1644.01 E:0.087440 |  but that was enough of a deflection to take it beyond anyone in a white shirt.
[1912.52 - 1914.28] P:1658.64 E:0.104984 |  But back it comes for England again.
[1914.28 - 1915.96] P:1656.79 E:0.105444 |  Here's Bellingham once more.
[1915.96 - 1918.84] P:1654.80 E:0.095699 |  Bellingham 30 yards out, right-footed cross into the box.
[1918.84 - 1919.64] P:1751.43 E:0.086678 |  Saka gambled.
[1919.64 - 1923.40] P:1388.36 E:0.095441 |  It was headed away, though, by Pavlovic for Serbia.
[1923.96 - 1927.40] P:1329.25 E:0.109310 |  And Declan Rice now in possession of the ball.
[1928.12 - 1931.40] P:1634.21 E:0.110183 |  Alexander-Arnold, I mean, it's a very fluid England.
[1932.28 - 1933.48] P:1691.93 E:0.108542 |  Formation, this.
[1933.48 - 1935.96] P:1431.32 E:0.110292 |  I mean, Alexander-Arnold's now here on the left-hand side.
[1936.60 - 1940.04] P:1388.12 E:0.111329 |  And Alexander-Arnold, there in the alley, gave it away, actually, to Mitrovic.
[1940.04 - 1941.72] P:1576.47 E:0.099498 |  He was rather slow on that, I must say.
[1942.28 - 1942.84] P:1251.28 E:0.111237 |  Stones.
[1942.84 - 1945.48] P:1473.19 E:0.105339 |  Now Walker for Saka again on the right-hand side.
[1945.48 - 1948.04] P:1603.82 E:0.105011 |  Saka taking on Pavlovic, going down.
[1948.04 - 1951.40] P:1555.44 E:0.110929 |  And the referee says it was hand-balled, I think,
[1951.40 - 1955.00] P:1735.32 E:0.104981 |  by Saka in a tefri kick to Serbia with England 1-0.
[1955.00 - 1959.24] P:1545.17 E:0.097920 |  Yeah, they're struggling to get to grips with that Walker-Saka combination.
[1959.32 - 1963.80] P:1440.70 E:0.094137 |  The pass always seems to be on the angle from Walker inside the pitch.
[1963.80 - 1970.60] P:1463.04 E:0.093637 |  As I look at a slow motion of the Jude Bellingham right-foot sidewinder across the field.
[1970.60 - 1973.16] P:1485.07 E:0.095208 |  I mean, technically, just executes it so well.
[1973.16 - 1978.92] P:1402.87 E:0.095163 |  But on that far side for England, Walker and Saka really are working well together.
[1978.92 - 1980.12] P:1393.06 E:0.095680 |  Really good understanding.
[1980.12 - 1985.40] P:1419.76 E:0.089235 |  And Pavlovic at the left-side centre-back struggling to know what position to take up.
[1985.40 - 1986.76] P:1493.80 E:0.101716 |  Serbia-0, England 1.
[1986.76 - 1988.12] P:1539.67 E:0.096216 |  Five live BBC sounds.
[1989.24 - 1991.48] P:1392.49 E:0.102539 |  I hope you're going to be with us all the way through the Euros.
[1991.48 - 1993.32] P:1473.78 E:0.069116 |  Every match covered.
[1993.32 - 1996.76] P:1517.60 E:0.086523 |  And we've got three more commentaries for you tomorrow.
[1996.76 - 2000.52] P:1514.36 E:0.098887 |  Romania, Ukraine, Belgium, Slovakia as the group E matches get under way.
[2000.52 - 2002.92] P:1505.83 E:0.095052 |  They're the first two commentaries at two and five.
[2002.92 - 2005.80] P:1515.47 E:0.100932 |  And then tomorrow night, you and I will be in Düsseldorf, won't we?
[2005.80 - 2007.96] P:1484.76 E:0.104583 |  First in Austria against France.
[2009.40 - 2015.40] P:1516.07 E:0.104208 |  One of the leading contenders, Didier Deschamps, side.
[2017.24 - 2018.84] P:1454.31 E:0.115041 |  Serbia bringing the ball forward.
[2019.72 - 2023.64] P:1287.29 E:0.100782 |  With Pavlovic, who gets it back there near the halfway line.
[2023.64 - 2026.44] P:1380.53 E:0.096800 |  And then Pavlovic all the way across to Velkovic.
[2027.16 - 2031.00] P:1321.22 E:0.093345 |  And Velkovic here to Zivkovic on the right flank.
[2031.00 - 2037.24] P:1396.67 E:0.094003 |  Comes back centrally again for once England are out of possession inside their own half.
[2037.24 - 2039.08] P:1552.46 E:0.095100 |  And it's Serbia trying to craft something.
[2039.08 - 2044.44] P:1576.06 E:0.100865 |  Here is the now Saudi-Arabian-based Mitrovic to Zivkovic on the right-hand side.
[2044.44 - 2045.96] P:1452.21 E:0.119129 |  Left-footed ball into the penalty area.
[2046.04 - 2047.80] P:1729.09 E:0.096824 |  Roel Well had it away by Gay.
[2047.80 - 2051.80] P:1690.02 E:0.096860 |  And then England are able to get it further away through Saka and Forden.
[2051.80 - 2055.80] P:1721.82 E:0.099563 |  And Forden with a very nice touch actually, but not enough to reach Harry Kane.
[2055.80 - 2058.04] P:1593.47 E:0.112079 |  But an aerial threat there when we know that.
[2058.04 - 2060.28] P:1673.13 E:0.108153 |  We know the threat that Serbia are in the air.
[2060.28 - 2063.00] P:1733.47 E:0.107415 |  Yeah, when they put the ball in the box, not only do they deliver it,
[2063.00 - 2064.84] P:1703.94 E:0.102252 |  they have players that arrive in there.
[2064.84 - 2069.32] P:1551.57 E:0.088668 |  And I have to say, Mark Gehrheet, he's up there with my player of the match so far.
[2069.32 - 2072.28] P:1554.68 E:0.098133 |  His performance for England, he's been brilliant left side centre-back.
[2072.28 - 2074.04] P:1552.34 E:0.090440 |  His position has been great.
[2074.04 - 2076.20] P:1693.72 E:0.100739 |  He's gone in tight and put players under pressure.
[2076.20 - 2079.08] P:1538.06 E:0.111534 |  His winning balls in the air, he's passing it well.
[2079.08 - 2082.52] P:1463.08 E:0.106927 |  He's had a really solid opening half an hour for England.
[2084.20 - 2089.80] P:1475.91 E:0.094342 |  Serbia, who scored more headers, no goals from headers in the qualifiers than any other team.
[2089.80 - 2092.20] P:1564.72 E:0.106321 |  And Mark Gehrheet, who certainly is not the tallest,
[2092.20 - 2095.08] P:1481.92 E:0.099632 |  Serbia bringing the ball forward again from the halfway line.
[2097.64 - 2102.20] P:1637.35 E:0.103683 |  Lukic, under pressure, has to turn back and give it back to the left-hand side to Kostic,
[2102.28 - 2105.96] P:1634.99 E:0.092613 |  who angles it back, now near the left corner of the England penalty area.
[2105.96 - 2109.40] P:1705.09 E:0.093220 |  Saka jumps in, comes back to Kostic, his left foot of the ball across the box,
[2109.40 - 2112.92] P:1689.22 E:0.103163 |  but in position is Dutalingen, who swings the right foot at it
[2112.92 - 2115.00] P:1610.45 E:0.101288 |  and puts it out near the halfway line.
[2115.00 - 2119.48] P:1639.49 E:0.099782 |  Yeah, not the tallest by any means, Mark Gehrheet as a central defender.
[2120.68 - 2127.08] P:1604.25 E:0.091729 |  He's given us six foot tall, but I interviewed him the other day after the Iceland match.
[2127.08 - 2131.32] P:1477.93 E:0.098251 |  And producer Gary Flintoff took a photograph of us for the old social media.
[2131.40 - 2135.56] P:1481.78 E:0.093388 |  When I saw it, I thought, I'm absolutely cowering over Mark Gehrheet.
[2136.52 - 2137.48] P:1742.04 E:0.088435 |  That's most people.
[2138.12 - 2141.96] P:1631.43 E:0.094662 |  You just don't realise, because you're in that lofty space up there,
[2141.96 - 2143.24] P:1481.65 E:0.088071 |  and we're all just staring up at you.
[2143.24 - 2143.88] P:1395.25 E:0.057429 |  Yeah, but he certainly...
[2145.80 - 2146.30] P:1602.81 E:0.082071 |  Yeah.
[2147.32 - 2148.92] P:1604.10 E:0.098298 |  Anyway, well, he can jump.
[2148.92 - 2151.00] P:1676.55 E:0.093589 |  He certainly can, as he's just proved.
[2151.00 - 2156.92] P:1473.30 E:0.079658 |  And if you time it well, you can be six foot and be really dominant in the air.
[2156.92 - 2160.60] P:1529.51 E:0.089920 |  Yeah, remember Canavaro, of course, so I don't think was six foot tall.
[2160.60 - 2161.88] P:1412.85 E:0.096695 |  No, probably not, just under.
[2163.24 - 2166.20] P:1335.94 E:0.106088 |  Here is Serbia, carrying the ball to the halfway line.
[2166.20 - 2168.36] P:1397.81 E:0.103477 |  England are leading by one goal to nil.
[2169.56 - 2172.36] P:1609.91 E:0.107301 |  And then Gehrheet steps out, it was a heavy touch,
[2172.36 - 2175.72] P:1704.51 E:0.105710 |  and now Gehrheet's out of possession, but Declan Rice is in position.
[2175.72 - 2179.56] P:1706.94 E:0.094229 |  And as the attempted pass was made towards the edge of the England box,
[2179.56 - 2182.28] P:1541.31 E:0.080172 |  Declan Rice was in exactly the right place.
[2182.28 - 2183.80] P:1717.19 E:0.084611 |  It really sensed that.
[2183.80 - 2186.60] P:1601.73 E:0.088644 |  I'm not sure there's a better defensive midfield play
[2186.84 - 2190.68] P:1593.17 E:0.091756 |  that senses that kind of situation and reads it instinctively,
[2190.68 - 2192.60] P:1532.06 E:0.104545 |  as well as Declan Rice in this tournament.
[2192.60 - 2193.88] P:1617.12 E:0.094658 |  I think he's superb at it.
[2194.92 - 2200.12] P:1622.26 E:0.093634 |  One nil England, and celebrity photographer Gary Flimtoff
[2200.12 - 2202.60] P:1648.64 E:0.102952 |  points out that Canavaro was five foot nine.
[2203.72 - 2205.16] P:1291.50 E:0.105678 |  Wow, no, really.
[2205.16 - 2206.36] P:1605.43 E:0.072645 |  Here's Lukic.
[2206.36 - 2211.24] P:1538.15 E:0.088840 |  Lukic out to the left-hand side, and here's Kostich again, back in field.
[2211.24 - 2215.80] P:1717.40 E:0.093994 |  Sasa Lukic, with some sort of strapping around his right wrist,
[2215.80 - 2217.00] P:1488.37 E:0.104546 |  comes to the right-hand side.
[2217.00 - 2221.32] P:1449.23 E:0.094377 |  Zivkovich is there, and then Zivkovich back into his own half.
[2221.32 - 2223.96] P:1569.93 E:0.109587 |  Martin, as Manchester United, are you going to throw that one in?
[2223.96 - 2224.60] P:1344.86 E:0.090642 |  Yeah, that's right.
[2224.60 - 2225.72] P:1628.26 E:0.115934 |  Should we keep going or stop?
[2225.72 - 2227.24] P:1631.80 E:0.105528 |  We could do.
[2227.24 - 2227.88] P:1506.50 E:0.088404 |  Chris Perri.
[2228.84 - 2229.24] P:1507.91 E:0.116192 |  Yeah.
[2229.24 - 2230.92] P:1626.61 E:0.096451 |  Yeah, he was probably under six foot.
[2231.80 - 2232.68] P:1379.37 E:0.121228 |  Good header of the ball.
[2232.68 - 2235.32] P:1671.40 E:0.082397 |  He might have been six feet, maybe.
[2235.32 - 2237.48] P:1644.99 E:0.107929 |  Here is Serbia on the halfway line.
[2237.48 - 2241.32] P:1635.42 E:0.095519 |  It's chip caught by Mitrovic, Zivkovich taking on Gehi,
[2241.32 - 2243.88] P:1713.17 E:0.107213 |  and then Flavic is moving in field,
[2244.12 - 2246.12] P:1737.33 E:0.098554 |  Jude Bellingham just got a touch on that.
[2246.12 - 2247.96] P:1623.68 E:0.104717 |  Rice was there behind him as well.
[2247.96 - 2249.48] P:1606.88 E:0.099831 |  Bellingham and Rice together.
[2250.20 - 2252.52] P:1614.41 E:0.115900 |  Many people felt that it should have been Bellingham and Rice
[2252.52 - 2254.44] P:1548.38 E:0.100164 |  as the two central midfielders.
[2254.44 - 2255.96] P:1468.97 E:0.107756 |  Bellingham's pass, he was caught late there,
[2255.96 - 2257.56] P:1477.71 E:0.099097 |  but he's found the pass to Saka.
[2257.56 - 2259.08] P:1601.59 E:0.114550 |  Kane making grants through the middle.
[2259.08 - 2261.72] P:1601.77 E:0.109191 |  Oh, Saka beats his man brilliantly into the box.
[2261.72 - 2263.88] P:1600.51 E:0.110332 |  Law ball across behind Foden,
[2263.88 - 2266.84] P:1594.06 E:0.107907 |  and the ball rolls all the way out into the opposite full-back position.
[2267.40 - 2270.28] P:1461.24 E:0.106187 |  Wow, Bakaio Saka brimming with confidence.
[2270.28 - 2272.28] P:1528.23 E:0.104769 |  He knows he's got the beat in Pavlovic.
[2273.00 - 2274.76] P:1457.03 E:0.100543 |  One-on-one, just too quick for him.
[2274.76 - 2277.40] P:1607.41 E:0.098328 |  Lovely little step over, gets around the outside of him,
[2277.40 - 2280.36] P:1576.88 E:0.090754 |  and it's a shame that Foden just couldn't adjust his run.
[2280.36 - 2283.48] P:1295.05 E:0.097764 |  He's making that run from outside to into that near post,
[2283.48 - 2284.84] P:1207.16 E:0.096308 |  the back post area.
[2284.84 - 2287.80] P:1294.01 E:0.096790 |  The ball just a little bit behind him, couldn't adjust himself.
[2288.52 - 2291.00] P:1143.84 E:0.088642 |  So that was Dazzling from Saka.
[2291.00 - 2292.84] P:1307.92 E:0.107711 |  He's already set up one goal for England,
[2293.40 - 2296.52] P:1337.53 E:0.095715 |  and looked as though he might get another one there.
[2297.16 - 2299.80] P:1449.41 E:0.100695 |  So Serbia have had a better spell of possession.
[2299.80 - 2301.16] P:1444.55 E:0.105644 |  They've threatened a little more,
[2301.16 - 2302.60] P:1552.75 E:0.079778 |  but as you say...
[2303.48 - 2305.08] P:1561.62 E:0.100004 |  I feel like England almost want that, John.
[2305.08 - 2308.92] P:1536.85 E:0.099412 |  As long as we can cope with it and deal with those defensive situations,
[2308.92 - 2311.40] P:1574.74 E:0.090873 |  certainly in the air when the ball comes in the box,
[2311.40 - 2313.40] P:1538.40 E:0.097225 |  I think it's going to suit England that they do come out,
[2313.40 - 2315.96] P:1541.25 E:0.092259 |  and then we get those one-on-one situations wide
[2315.96 - 2319.40] P:1468.61 E:0.087561 |  with Foden and Saka and Bellingham into Harry Kane.
[2319.40 - 2323.96] P:1616.08 E:0.090705 |  Yeah, he took on the absolutely strict Pavlovic for pace.
[2323.96 - 2328.44] P:1680.26 E:0.098051 |  He has Lukic, Lukic 10 yards inside the England half to his left,
[2328.52 - 2331.24] P:1528.50 E:0.101728 |  and then Mitrovic curls the pass out towards the left-hand side.
[2331.24 - 2332.92] P:1634.94 E:0.090758 |  Kostic is there. Kostic is high.
[2332.92 - 2335.64] P:1599.15 E:0.101639 |  Cross into the penalty area, headed down and away by Reis.
[2335.64 - 2337.48] P:1722.21 E:0.103927 |  Comes out centrally for Serbia again.
[2337.48 - 2340.84] P:1693.26 E:0.087173 |  They're threatening more than they have at any stage in the match now.
[2340.84 - 2343.48] P:1764.01 E:0.081496 |  Velkovic to Zivkovic.
[2343.48 - 2345.96] P:1803.10 E:0.094380 |  Zivkovic takes on Trippie, gets the cross in,
[2345.96 - 2349.56] P:1837.37 E:0.092918 |  but Reis was there as well at the near post,
[2349.56 - 2350.84] P:1710.18 E:0.114742 |  and brings the ball away,
[2350.84 - 2352.44] P:1784.83 E:0.095625 |  and then Foden with a confident touch,
[2352.44 - 2354.12] P:1781.27 E:0.107912 |  back to Bellingham on the edge of his own bar,
[2354.12 - 2357.56] P:1744.65 E:0.114660 |  who turns his man brilliantly, and then is basic.
[2358.44 - 2361.00] P:1520.32 E:0.115909 |  He's just pulled back, but then they take the free kick quickly.
[2361.00 - 2363.64] P:1658.06 E:0.113646 |  Bellingham takes it on, he's caught there by Goodell.
[2363.64 - 2366.20] P:1712.57 E:0.115706 |  The two of them, the ball had just got away from Bellingham,
[2366.20 - 2368.28] P:1719.71 E:0.121144 |  and Goodell came in, and the two of them collided,
[2368.28 - 2370.04] P:1746.11 E:0.111485 |  and the yellow card is out for Goodell.
[2370.04 - 2373.32] P:1784.00 E:0.103861 |  Just got a little bit overconfident there at two Bellingham.
[2373.32 - 2377.00] P:1720.23 E:0.104007 |  He rode the foul, and maybe could have just soaked up the foul
[2377.00 - 2378.68] P:1644.59 E:0.104019 |  and broke up the play and steady down.
[2378.68 - 2381.16] P:1566.52 E:0.094130 |  Instead, he stayed on his feet,
[2381.16 - 2383.64] P:1493.46 E:0.105653 |  and he did this marauding run into the middle of the pitch,
[2383.64 - 2387.00] P:1544.65 E:0.091020 |  and he just had a heavy touch, and he's back up on his feet.
[2387.08 - 2391.56] P:1651.06 E:0.085920 |  He tows the ball, and then takes the challenge
[2391.56 - 2393.24] P:1804.17 E:0.124746 |  on the side of the knee, and he's okay,
[2393.24 - 2395.56] P:1684.09 E:0.097139 |  but he was a little bit overstretched there, John, wasn't he?
[2395.56 - 2396.12] P:1467.52 E:0.111900 |  Yeah, he was.
[2396.76 - 2399.00] P:1613.64 E:0.089311 |  So Goodell has yellow carded,
[2399.80 - 2403.64] P:1709.98 E:0.087083 |  which is the first booking of the match for the experienced,
[2403.64 - 2405.96] P:1437.54 E:0.085255 |  number six, the Sevilla midfielder,
[2406.52 - 2409.32] P:1536.25 E:0.086037 |  sometime central defender Goodell,
[2409.32 - 2412.68] P:1527.84 E:0.091288 |  who's missed most of this season, actually, with an injury.
[2412.68 - 2415.08] P:1386.70 E:0.094283 |  He's had a couple of knee operations,
[2415.16 - 2418.20] P:1410.92 E:0.092639 |  but came back and played in the last league match for Sevilla.
[2419.24 - 2422.20] P:1327.61 E:0.101148 |  So, you know, he's a little bit like one or two of the England players,
[2422.20 - 2424.68] P:1493.49 E:0.097588 |  like Gay and Trippie, who've missed a lot of time this season,
[2424.68 - 2426.68] P:1324.91 E:0.101706 |  but have just got back in time for the Euros.
[2426.68 - 2428.28] P:1380.31 E:0.095811 |  He's a key player for Sevilla as well.
[2428.28 - 2431.16] P:1437.58 E:0.091115 |  Yeah, but Bellingham, fortunately, is okay,
[2431.16 - 2432.28] P:1413.68 E:0.085948 |  and he's back on his feet.
[2432.28 - 2435.88] P:1471.55 E:0.092429 |  Certainly taking some knocks over the course of the last few months.
[2435.88 - 2439.08] P:1514.27 E:0.093202 |  Jude Bellingham, England's goal scorer here tonight.
[2439.88 - 2444.04] P:1435.92 E:0.103092 |  21 in a few days' time, and in possession again.
[2444.84 - 2446.52] P:1639.36 E:0.120612 |  Bellingham, that's a great challenge.
[2447.72 - 2450.84] P:1525.94 E:0.114351 |  On Rice by Lukic, the ball had long gone there,
[2450.84 - 2453.48] P:1367.32 E:0.100786 |  and Rice also going to ground, has a glare at him.
[2453.48 - 2457.24] P:1487.25 E:0.081557 |  Yep, I think Serbia, just trying to let England know,
[2457.24 - 2458.92] P:1400.51 E:0.105812 |  they're not going to have it all their way with the ball,
[2458.92 - 2462.44] P:1559.77 E:0.090757 |  and get a little bit tied to come out and pressure a little bit,
[2463.08 - 2466.36] P:1546.52 E:0.098126 |  whether or not they feel they haven't done that well enough in this game,
[2466.36 - 2468.20] P:1462.54 E:0.098683 |  and they get a message from the side of the pitch
[2468.20 - 2469.24] P:1416.52 E:0.115819 |  to get a little bit tied to it.
[2469.24 - 2470.44] P:1236.89 E:0.111714 |  It certainly looks like that.
[2470.44 - 2473.48] P:1411.05 E:0.111144 |  Bellingham tried to use some excellent footwork
[2473.48 - 2476.52] P:1340.43 E:0.106745 |  to go between two players, wasn't able to do so this time,
[2476.52 - 2479.72] P:1397.25 E:0.105446 |  and Serbia knocked it back to goalkeeper, Rijkevic.
[2480.60 - 2481.64] P:1315.14 E:0.115024 |  So now, with...
[2482.76 - 2484.20] P:1323.84 E:0.108547 |  And they put the ball out of play,
[2484.20 - 2486.52] P:1346.24 E:0.113242 |  because there's a Serbian player down,
[2487.08 - 2490.60] P:1367.28 E:0.109743 |  it's Kostic, who's just sat down in the middle of the pitch.
[2490.60 - 2494.84] P:1204.77 E:0.107753 |  So while he receives some treatment,
[2494.84 - 2497.24] P:1579.14 E:0.100557 |  you can hear the noise inside the stadium.
[2497.24 - 2500.04] P:1673.87 E:0.097494 |  The England supporters singing the anthem.
[2500.28 - 2503.56] P:1694.13 E:0.099449 |  So we've got 40 minutes on the clock.
[2503.56 - 2507.80] P:1712.60 E:0.093469 |  Jude Bellingham, who's now scored at a World Cup,
[2508.60 - 2510.04] P:1626.89 E:0.110129 |  and a European Championship,
[2510.76 - 2514.04] P:1579.29 E:0.105127 |  and he's only the second man to do that before the age of 21
[2514.04 - 2518.12] P:1421.75 E:0.085541 |  to score in both of the tournaments after Michael Owen.
[2518.12 - 2521.72] P:1326.09 E:0.082621 |  So Owen and Bellingham have both managed to do that,
[2522.52 - 2525.32] P:1464.26 E:0.097491 |  and still Kostic's receiving some treatment.
[2525.32 - 2528.76] P:1433.73 E:0.100264 |  So what's the mood like down with you behind the goal, is he Christensen?
[2528.92 - 2532.28] P:1456.27 E:0.100093 |  The fans are still firmly in full voice.
[2532.28 - 2535.56] P:1530.00 E:0.097175 |  The noise has been incredible from the England fans,
[2535.56 - 2538.68] P:1482.82 E:0.095424 |  and just interesting, we knew that the Serbian threat
[2538.68 - 2540.92] P:1428.91 E:0.100388 |  was going to be from wide areas, crosses into the box,
[2540.92 - 2544.92] P:1527.22 E:0.094123 |  but fully agree with what Matt has said in commentary about Mark Gaye.
[2544.92 - 2548.36] P:1358.78 E:0.098351 |  The positioning and the way he's stepped in, he's been unbelievable,
[2548.36 - 2551.80] P:1537.57 E:0.094722 |  and Declan Reis has been dropping in to help defend the crosses,
[2551.80 - 2554.36] P:1586.32 E:0.096708 |  and the latest cross that came in from Serbia,
[2554.36 - 2557.88] P:1565.03 E:0.092330 |  Declan Reis just got so much power on the defensive clearance,
[2557.88 - 2559.96] P:1381.49 E:0.099552 |  and then the positioning of Bakaio Saka coming in,
[2559.96 - 2561.88] P:1503.16 E:0.089926 |  doing his defensive duties as well.
[2561.88 - 2563.88] P:1481.99 E:0.100560 |  England look really solid so far.
[2565.24 - 2567.32] P:1617.57 E:0.092332 |  Kostic still receiving treatment,
[2567.32 - 2569.64] P:1423.03 E:0.101759 |  and while that was happening on our little screen here,
[2569.64 - 2571.72] P:1505.19 E:0.096966 |  they were showing Matt the celebration,
[2571.72 - 2573.40] P:1504.83 E:0.089022 |  which was for the Bellingham goal,
[2573.40 - 2577.16] P:1471.81 E:0.098299 |  which was primarily involving Bellingham and Trent Alexander-Arnold,
[2577.16 - 2580.60] P:1552.62 E:0.097504 |  and I've heard this week that they've been spending a lot of time together,
[2580.60 - 2583.56] P:1514.31 E:0.089823 |  the two of them, they both went down onto one knee.
[2583.56 - 2586.28] P:1539.97 E:0.093387 |  I have to say, I'm not sure what that was from.
[2586.92 - 2588.52] P:1473.36 E:0.122450 |  Anyone else got any idea?
[2588.52 - 2590.84] P:1401.05 E:0.082839 |  You're looking around like we should know, John.
[2590.84 - 2593.24] P:1516.06 E:0.097725 |  I suspect it might have come from something or other.
[2594.20 - 2597.64] P:1514.75 E:0.098865 |  Somebody will know, but it looked very rehearsed, didn't it?
[2597.64 - 2598.12] P:1582.02 E:0.082307 |  It did.
[2598.12 - 2599.64] P:1462.03 E:0.092179 |  When I said to Garissel get yesterday,
[2599.64 - 2600.76] P:1271.12 E:0.103269 |  what have you been working on?
[2600.76 - 2602.68] P:1552.27 E:0.082433 |  He didn't mention goal celebration.
[2603.32 - 2604.76] P:1543.82 E:0.105928 |  I think what was interesting about that replay
[2604.76 - 2606.04] P:1714.82 E:0.094837 |  is the run of Harry Kane,
[2606.04 - 2609.24] P:1721.10 E:0.098750 |  because he just takes the defender out of the space into that near post there,
[2609.24 - 2610.92] P:1629.39 E:0.089063 |  he makes that run across,
[2610.92 - 2613.88] P:1512.41 E:0.091467 |  and it was a nasty deflection from that cross from Saka.
[2613.88 - 2615.40] P:1466.95 E:0.097309 |  He almost tries to hit it along the ground,
[2615.48 - 2617.64] P:1422.31 E:0.092258 |  but it goes under the foot of the defender,
[2617.64 - 2619.56] P:1505.11 E:0.097160 |  and it really does kick up off the turf
[2619.56 - 2621.24] P:1498.43 E:0.089381 |  and loops into the box brilliantly.
[2622.52 - 2624.44] P:1609.43 E:0.100677 |  I'm not sure Kostić is going to be able to continue.
[2625.56 - 2627.16] P:1633.50 E:0.104807 |  He had that look on his face, John,
[2628.04 - 2631.40] P:1611.36 E:0.104880 |  when you can see a player and they kind of know or feel like they're done.
[2631.40 - 2633.40] P:1655.51 E:0.108703 |  And he just had this dejected look on his face
[2633.40 - 2636.84] P:1747.54 E:0.101619 |  when he was down on the grass at the start of that injury situation.
[2636.84 - 2638.84] P:1660.48 E:0.101181 |  Oh, he's going to kick the ball away.
[2638.84 - 2640.52] P:1649.38 E:0.097497 |  John Stones has kicked the ball away
[2640.52 - 2642.76] P:1536.87 E:0.094980 |  when a throwing had been given to Serbia.
[2643.24 - 2646.76] P:1662.38 E:0.097001 |  And Mitrovic immediately, and he is the captain,
[2646.76 - 2648.84] P:1554.52 E:0.114503 |  immediately appealed to the referee,
[2649.96 - 2652.28] P:1762.76 E:0.090027 |  the action should be taken against John Stones.
[2652.28 - 2653.96] P:1797.13 E:0.088974 |  Unfortunately for England,
[2653.96 - 2656.92] P:1572.82 E:0.093384 |  the referee has not shown a yellow card.
[2656.92 - 2660.68] P:1745.13 E:0.089391 |  And yet there is a change for Serbia,
[2660.68 - 2664.20] P:1727.98 E:0.095448 |  and it is Kostić who's coming off just before halftime,
[2664.84 - 2666.04] P:1666.11 E:0.101025 |  not sure what happened to him.
[2666.04 - 2667.88] P:1768.65 E:0.087802 |  He just sat down on the pitch,
[2667.88 - 2671.00] P:1727.28 E:0.101658 |  and he's being replaced by the number 25,
[2671.08 - 2674.04] P:1776.52 E:0.106064 |  who was a possibility to be in the starting line-up.
[2674.04 - 2677.16] P:1497.55 E:0.092579 |  Yeah, the Panathanaikos man, Philip Mladenovic,
[2678.12 - 2682.52] P:1644.24 E:0.087004 |  and he is on straight swap at left wing back.
[2682.52 - 2685.24] P:1746.10 E:0.094174 |  Yeah, I don't think there's too much to choose between those two
[2685.24 - 2686.36] P:1528.88 E:0.095032 |  in terms of selection.
[2686.36 - 2689.00] P:1496.17 E:0.079498 |  I think that's quite a tough call for Stojkovic,
[2689.00 - 2691.96] P:1632.31 E:0.084328 |  so it shouldn't affect Serbia too much.
[2692.76 - 2697.48] P:1723.35 E:0.096839 |  Yep, so now the number 25 Mladenovic at left wing back.
[2697.48 - 2700.28] P:1730.23 E:0.091036 |  Serbia, Nile, England, halftime approaching.
[2700.36 - 2702.92] P:1465.37 E:0.106272 |  We'll have more from the US open, by the way, from Ian Carter.
[2702.92 - 2704.84] P:1603.37 E:0.086932 |  The commentary is on Sports Extra right now.
[2704.84 - 2708.44] P:1590.68 E:0.102981 |  Rory McElrion, now one shot behind Bryson Dišanbo,
[2709.16 - 2713.48] P:1576.29 E:0.102104 |  in the final round, so it could be a gripping night there as well.
[2714.52 - 2718.60] P:1571.27 E:0.087459 |  Here is Rykovic, the goalkeeper, long through the middle.
[2718.60 - 2724.28] P:1654.23 E:0.097667 |  Mitrovic chests this down, and gets no change out of Declan Reis,
[2724.28 - 2727.08] P:1409.05 E:0.099535 |  bounces back to Pikvod, Vlavač trying to close him down,
[2727.08 - 2728.84] P:1104.80 E:0.093675 |  but right-footed away by Pikvod.
[2728.84 - 2731.80] P:1325.49 E:0.101127 |  Brilliant control from Saka, near the halfway line.
[2731.80 - 2736.36] P:1643.17 E:0.107594 |  Saka then running back down his own wing, inside his own half,
[2736.36 - 2738.36] P:1525.70 E:0.094931 |  but taking the ball away from Serbia.
[2738.92 - 2741.88] P:1467.75 E:0.092727 |  And then in the end, Stolz clears it to the halfway line,
[2741.88 - 2743.00] P:1426.27 E:0.088995 |  and Serbia back in possession.
[2743.00 - 2745.64] P:1395.63 E:0.111594 |  There aren't many players that ride contact
[2745.64 - 2747.64] P:1313.08 E:0.105153 |  or challenge better than Bakao Saka.
[2747.64 - 2748.92] P:1443.67 E:0.105449 |  It's phenomenal for his size.
[2748.92 - 2751.96] P:1219.56 E:0.103960 |  I mean, he's so strong when he's grounded.
[2751.96 - 2754.36] P:1068.86 E:0.096997 |  He just gets his feet in the turf,
[2754.36 - 2757.48] P:1167.64 E:0.112461 |  he uses his strength of his lower body just to pull people off,
[2757.48 - 2760.52] P:1457.04 E:0.108251 |  and then he rides that tackle, he's got that lovely shimmy,
[2760.52 - 2762.36] P:1594.14 E:0.107263 |  shifts the ball once he lands.
[2762.36 - 2764.76] P:1485.16 E:0.097643 |  It was a brilliant hold-up play from him.
[2764.76 - 2766.76] P:1481.74 E:0.107959 |  One-mail England, Jude Bellingham's goal.
[2767.32 - 2770.12] P:1435.89 E:0.107220 |  And here is Gudal, who goes past Bellingham.
[2770.12 - 2772.76] P:1703.24 E:0.112426 |  There's a huge cheer from the Serbia fans for that,
[2773.64 - 2776.84] P:1431.31 E:0.086244 |  giving Bellingham a bit of his own medicine
[2776.84 - 2778.28] P:1283.98 E:0.088091 |  back to the halfway line.
[2778.28 - 2779.24] P:1567.97 E:0.075777 |  It goes.
[2779.24 - 2785.80] P:1722.92 E:0.089587 |  And then Milinkovic Sabic is the other man in this Serbian team
[2785.88 - 2787.88] P:1429.82 E:0.106913 |  who's playing his football in Saudi Arabia now.
[2787.88 - 2789.88] P:1537.89 E:0.101768 |  Milinkovic Sabic comes back centrally.
[2789.88 - 2792.04] P:1577.18 E:0.107364 |  They want them to have a goal from distance,
[2792.04 - 2794.28] P:1638.56 E:0.109863 |  but instead, I think he was in two mines, actually,
[2794.28 - 2796.60] P:1680.68 E:0.099161 |  Sasa Lukic, and just played a ball over the top
[2796.60 - 2797.88] P:1570.20 E:0.090940 |  that bounced through for a goal kick.
[2797.88 - 2800.44] P:1589.28 E:0.076921 |  And we have two minutes of added time
[2800.44 - 2802.60] P:1548.83 E:0.090709 |  at the end of this first half to play,
[2802.60 - 2806.04] P:1477.97 E:0.087716 |  and England leading through the Jude Bellingham goal
[2806.04 - 2807.24] P:1394.87 E:0.078633 |  in the 13th minute.
[2807.24 - 2810.04] P:1504.33 E:0.084025 |  Yeah, I'm thinking that the performance
[2810.04 - 2811.72] P:1510.80 E:0.094627 |  has been a very solid one from England.
[2811.72 - 2814.20] P:1566.55 E:0.087421 |  I think we're coping well with that threat
[2814.92 - 2817.72] P:1521.59 E:0.100961 |  that Serbia have when the ball's wide crosses in the box.
[2817.72 - 2820.12] P:1593.72 E:0.093064 |  As he's mentioned, Declan Rice getting back in that space
[2820.12 - 2821.64] P:1542.93 E:0.095704 |  to help out the two centre backs.
[2821.64 - 2824.52] P:1625.19 E:0.093597 |  If any of the balls are loose or just fading away
[2824.52 - 2827.16] P:1578.61 E:0.102070 |  to that penalty spot area, he's in there to clear the headers.
[2827.16 - 2829.32] P:1455.83 E:0.093117 |  And we're picking up the pieces pretty well.
[2829.32 - 2833.40] P:1448.59 E:0.100835 |  And then he's still only 1-0, so there's a lot to play for,
[2833.40 - 2837.16] P:1427.52 E:0.105976 |  but it's pretty solid from England so far in this opening 45 minutes.
[2837.16 - 2840.36] P:1533.71 E:0.112410 |  Yep, solid, but a 1-0 lead as the precarious lead.
[2840.36 - 2841.80] P:1568.82 E:0.099070 |  Jodanovic wins the free kick.
[2841.80 - 2844.60] P:1463.91 E:0.091103 |  Mitrovic plays it back towards the halfway line,
[2844.60 - 2846.44] P:1270.39 E:0.099137 |  and England drop back behind the ball again.
[2847.16 - 2850.68] P:1433.57 E:0.094773 |  Harry Kane's been quiet, I must say, in the match.
[2850.68 - 2851.48] P:1483.95 E:0.070792 |  Yep.
[2851.48 - 2855.64] P:1359.23 E:0.094597 |  It's Bellingham and Saka and Rice and Alexander-Arnold,
[2855.64 - 2859.56] P:1486.91 E:0.093381 |  really, that I think the eye has been drawn to primarily.
[2860.12 - 2862.52] P:1570.74 E:0.110395 |  There's Mitrovic just plays the ball back,
[2862.52 - 2864.84] P:1644.71 E:0.111536 |  centrely it comes square to Lukic,
[2864.84 - 2866.84] P:1609.10 E:0.110760 |  and then Lukic across here to the right-hand side,
[2866.84 - 2869.56] P:1614.66 E:0.095696 |  to Zivkovic again, who's up against Trebia.
[2869.56 - 2871.24] P:1616.42 E:0.098384 |  The right foot had left back,
[2871.24 - 2872.60] P:1726.24 E:0.114201 |  and now the cross from the right,
[2872.60 - 2875.40] P:1795.56 E:0.104290 |  in towards the back post, John Stones got something on it,
[2875.40 - 2879.00] P:1631.58 E:0.116373 |  and was able to miss-hit it beyond the far post.
[2879.00 - 2881.88] P:1679.56 E:0.108376 |  There was panic stations there for a moment for England
[2881.88 - 2883.72] P:1723.50 E:0.106646 |  after the cross from the right.
[2884.84 - 2887.48] P:1782.97 E:0.110862 |  Well, that was a bit chaotic, I mean, it was a big collision,
[2887.48 - 2890.28] P:1641.45 E:0.105747 |  I think with Walker and someone at the back post initially,
[2890.28 - 2891.24] P:1423.27 E:0.100666 |  they got back up with the feet,
[2891.24 - 2893.64] P:1504.63 E:0.111254 |  and that was a tricky ball for John Stones to deal with.
[2893.64 - 2896.36] P:1406.83 E:0.110637 |  You've almost got to time it to guide the ball out of play,
[2896.92 - 2898.68] P:1234.16 E:0.119203 |  along with the flight of the ball as well.
[2898.68 - 2901.00] P:1419.85 E:0.113039 |  It was a really hard one to clear for Stones.
[2901.08 - 2903.40] P:1444.91 E:0.114209 |  So it's a Serbian corner from the left-hand side,
[2903.40 - 2905.24] P:1468.41 E:0.111777 |  in added time, it's drawn into the near post,
[2905.24 - 2906.76] P:1562.28 E:0.092262 |  and cleared away by Bellingham,
[2906.76 - 2909.64] P:1715.83 E:0.085647 |  who got there first ahead of Milinkovic Savic.
[2909.64 - 2913.00] P:1647.48 E:0.095515 |  But Milinkovic Savic is back in possession for Serbia.
[2913.00 - 2915.32] P:1712.22 E:0.110412 |  But that's it, the Serbian attack comes to an end,
[2915.32 - 2917.88] P:1760.28 E:0.102716 |  because the referee blows his whistle for half-time.
[2918.60 - 2922.04] P:1680.85 E:0.096873 |  So we weren't sure what to think about England
[2922.04 - 2925.16] P:1450.35 E:0.107237 |  coming into this European Championship after the...
[2925.16 - 2926.60] P:1448.86 E:0.112828 |  Everything that happened last week,
[2926.60 - 2929.24] P:1643.97 E:0.082628 |  with the squad being cut to 26,
[2929.24 - 2932.76] P:1615.70 E:0.091442 |  and all of the stories and the Iceland defeat.
[2932.76 - 2934.76] P:1627.11 E:0.098589 |  But the first 45 minutes have been played,
[2934.76 - 2936.76] P:1327.87 E:0.093047 |  Matt Upps and England are winning 1-0.
[2936.76 - 2939.64] P:1707.29 E:0.096242 |  Yeah, I mean, it's a performance so far of confidence.
[2939.64 - 2941.32] P:1860.92 E:0.091431 |  It's got some purpose.
[2941.32 - 2945.80] P:1662.34 E:0.095148 |  It's a million miles away from what we watched at Wembley against Iceland.
[2945.80 - 2948.92] P:1744.26 E:0.096605 |  And you get a feeling that it's business-like from England.
[2948.92 - 2951.32] P:1674.16 E:0.102153 |  They've been decisive when they're needed to be,
[2951.32 - 2953.40] P:1699.60 E:0.103443 |  in terms of using the ball and being positive,
[2953.40 - 2956.36] P:1794.99 E:0.095155 |  and sliding those balls in behind Bellingham,
[2956.36 - 2958.28] P:1764.29 E:0.102158 |  has been everywhere, and has been outstanding.
[2958.36 - 2960.12] P:1651.02 E:0.101662 |  And as I mentioned, Mark Gehrig, I think,
[2960.12 - 2962.76] P:1752.49 E:0.092781 |  has been brilliant at the back for England defensively.
[2962.76 - 2966.36] P:1724.02 E:0.099208 |  It's been a good opening 45 minutes to this Euro for me.
[2967.48 - 2970.44] P:1760.17 E:0.107519 |  So, down the golden steps, all of the players.
[2971.48 - 2973.96] P:1695.48 E:0.110120 |  Bukaj Osaka is the last man off the pitch,
[2973.96 - 2976.28] P:1754.52 E:0.102112 |  and down the golden steps to make their way through
[2976.84 - 2980.84] P:1706.29 E:0.089370 |  that mineshaft-style tunnel
[2980.84 - 2983.40] P:1599.68 E:0.087742 |  that takes them towards the dressing room.
[2983.40 - 2987.96] P:1838.57 E:0.087747 |  But the first half at the cool face has been OK for England.
[2987.96 - 2992.68] P:1863.54 E:0.100377 |  Serbia Nil, England 1, and Kelly Kate is here with us in Gelsenkirk.
[2992.68 - 2993.40] P:1739.49 E:0.075032 |  Kelly.
[2993.40 - 2996.76] P:1823.10 E:0.103237 |  John Murray and Matthew Upsson watching on from our commentary position
[2996.76 - 2997.88] P:1804.45 E:0.109461 |  here at Gelsenkirk.
[2997.88 - 3001.56] P:1950.34 E:0.100850 |  And then Izzy Christensen is pitch-side behind the goal,
[3001.56 - 3004.28] P:1823.44 E:0.086584 |  was behind Jordan Pickham for that first half,
[3004.28 - 3007.40] P:1871.35 E:0.100379 |  and will be behind the Serbia goal for the second half.
[3007.40 - 3010.60] P:1836.36 E:0.102837 |  And I'd be hoping to see some action in that goal in the second half.
[3010.60 - 3013.64] P:1913.79 E:0.093156 |  But as far as the first half is concerned,
[3013.64 - 3016.60] P:1870.16 E:0.101610 |  what did you make of the England team and the set-up?
[3016.60 - 3020.44] P:1793.62 E:0.088190 |  I know Matt describes it in the first half as incredibly fluid,
[3020.44 - 3023.08] P:1869.12 E:0.076069 |  certainly the freedom that those midfielders were given.
[3023.08 - 3026.04] P:1828.88 E:0.087938 |  Yeah, I think he just actually just said it there
[3026.04 - 3028.68] P:1768.13 E:0.096419 |  at the end of that first half, business-like.
[3028.68 - 3029.88] P:1815.91 E:0.098078 |  And I've thought the exact same.
[3030.52 - 3033.64] P:1829.89 E:0.098966 |  There's a real strut about England, there's a real flow.
[3034.20 - 3035.40] P:1866.01 E:0.115029 |  You know, I'm pitch-side here,
[3035.40 - 3037.88] P:1866.58 E:0.091357 |  and I can see the way the back four and Jordan Pickford
[3037.88 - 3039.40] P:1993.66 E:0.086283 |  are communicating with each other.
[3039.40 - 3041.08] P:1998.52 E:0.103780 |  They look fully in control,
[3041.08 - 3043.64] P:1863.15 E:0.105125 |  and as soon as there's a moment where they drift out of control,
[3043.64 - 3045.64] P:1958.30 E:0.093101 |  they're snapping each other back into line,
[3045.64 - 3048.92] P:1829.13 E:0.099725 |  because they know 1-0, like John said in commentary, is very precarious.
[3048.92 - 3051.96] P:1757.76 E:0.081392 |  They've got to keep their foothold in the game,
[3051.96 - 3054.20] P:1825.60 E:0.096056 |  keep turning the screw and get that second goal.
[3054.20 - 3056.60] P:1847.30 E:0.083295 |  But Serbia have looked a little bit of a threat
[3056.60 - 3058.04] P:1669.58 E:0.099725 |  towards the end of that first half,
[3058.04 - 3060.92] P:1711.05 E:0.085057 |  and I think England will be pleased to go in with that 1-0,
[3060.92 - 3063.16] P:1687.81 E:0.092444 |  and they can have a discussion in the change rooms
[3063.16 - 3065.32] P:1753.94 E:0.099213 |  with the manager and see where they can keep getting better.
[3066.04 - 3068.52] P:1800.44 E:0.104233 |  Yeah, there have been a couple of moments for England
[3068.52 - 3071.72] P:1712.83 E:0.090413 |  where maybe it looked like Serbia could get something in that first half,
[3071.72 - 3073.00] P:1735.76 E:0.105219 |  but obviously they lead.
[3073.08 - 3075.32] P:1864.90 E:0.095359 |  And the goal map from Jude Bellingham,
[3075.32 - 3078.36] P:1756.79 E:0.092180 |  again, it's an opening goal of a tournament from Jude Bellingham,
[3078.36 - 3081.40] P:1728.22 E:0.085781 |  but just his all-round performance in the first half has been excellent.
[3081.40 - 3085.08] P:1885.77 E:0.092361 |  Yeah, I mean, it's just so animated and pumped, is it?
[3085.08 - 3088.44] P:1718.75 E:0.094860 |  I almost want to say, just steady down a little bit.
[3088.44 - 3090.76] P:1726.91 E:0.092697 |  I mean, that sounds crazy, but I don't want him to get hurt.
[3090.76 - 3092.76] P:1756.13 E:0.101526 |  I don't want him to overrun a ball and get stretched
[3092.76 - 3094.36] P:1860.43 E:0.087574 |  and get injured or anything like that.
[3094.36 - 3095.96] P:1838.65 E:0.093664 |  But he's just been brilliant.
[3096.68 - 3099.00] P:1943.46 E:0.092945 |  That goal I loved. I just love seeing goals.
[3099.00 - 3101.80] P:1758.17 E:0.096972 |  That is so committed. It's relatively simple,
[3101.80 - 3103.08] P:1604.78 E:0.109202 |  but executed really well.
[3103.08 - 3106.60] P:1860.90 E:0.096254 |  And it's just about anticipation, that desire to want to get in the box,
[3106.60 - 3110.04] P:1849.69 E:0.090048 |  which he has, and that's why he scores so many goals.
[3110.04 - 3111.56] P:1947.10 E:0.098860 |  But he really threw himself in there.
[3111.56 - 3115.40] P:1891.19 E:0.094400 |  It was a powering header into the roof and the corner of the net,
[3115.40 - 3117.56] P:1932.79 E:0.093600 |  and just a great goal all around for me.
[3117.56 - 3120.92] P:1903.31 E:0.101863 |  Yeah, the best players always can do the complicated stuff, is he?
[3120.92 - 3124.60] P:1918.06 E:0.098506 |  But sometimes it's the simple thing that is the best choice,
[3124.60 - 3126.92] P:1941.91 E:0.096592 |  and the best players always make the best choice.
[3126.92 - 3129.56] P:1925.56 E:0.101915 |  That's right, and Matt actually alluded to it in commentary,
[3129.64 - 3132.60] P:1860.12 E:0.093257 |  and I was nodding along here pitchside when he said it,
[3132.60 - 3135.80] P:1716.78 E:0.092369 |  because the run of Harry Kane, not many people will notice that.
[3135.80 - 3137.56] P:1763.92 E:0.093276 |  They'll just notice the finish from Bellingham,
[3137.56 - 3140.52] P:1907.53 E:0.091880 |  which fully agreed great finish, great commitment,
[3140.52 - 3142.92] P:1741.10 E:0.090997 |  and the third man run into the box.
[3142.92 - 3144.76] P:1928.08 E:0.098493 |  But the run from Harry Kane,
[3144.76 - 3148.20] P:1838.93 E:0.095383 |  just to distract the Serbian defence to that front post area,
[3148.20 - 3149.80] P:1835.33 E:0.083237 |  it just opens up the gap.
[3149.80 - 3151.96] P:1851.89 E:0.101568 |  And it all comes from Karl Waukham, Bakao Saka.
[3151.96 - 3155.08] P:1700.92 E:0.100998 |  There's a little bit of chat about Bakao Saka coming into this tournament,
[3155.08 - 3156.84] P:1763.93 E:0.092691 |  not necessarily in his best form,
[3156.84 - 3159.24] P:1869.97 E:0.096481 |  but I think that's more of a reflection on the standards
[3159.32 - 3160.04] P:1919.07 E:0.080407 |  we expect from him.
[3160.04 - 3162.84] P:1677.68 E:0.103973 |  But the way that he made that run in behind and got the cross away,
[3162.84 - 3164.60] P:1822.71 E:0.087474 |  yeah, a bit fortuitous with the deflection,
[3164.60 - 3166.84] P:1814.95 E:0.091366 |  the way the ball arrived into the box.
[3166.84 - 3171.32] P:1850.63 E:0.096317 |  But the Harry Kane, Bellingham, duo inside that six-yard box is lethal.
[3172.36 - 3176.20] P:1874.41 E:0.102970 |  Is he six touches in the Serbia box compared to just one
[3176.20 - 3178.36] P:1925.22 E:0.105285 |  in Jordan Pickford's area in front of you?
[3178.36 - 3181.24] P:1988.86 E:0.103296 |  Is he so hopeful there'll be a bit more action for you
[3181.24 - 3183.72] P:1889.48 E:0.106184 |  in the second half, a bit closer to where you're standing
[3183.72 - 3185.56] P:1875.10 E:0.103635 |  behind that goal over towards our right?
[3185.56 - 3187.48] P:1928.49 E:0.088924 |  So, Izzy, for now, thank you very much.
[3187.56 - 3190.44] P:1908.47 E:0.106367 |  Izzy Christensen with us throughout the evening here on Five Live Sport.
[3190.44 - 3193.24] P:1947.01 E:0.091162 |  Matthew Upsham and John Murray are your commentary team.
[3193.24 - 3196.36] P:1911.67 E:0.096432 |  We will have second half commentary of England's opening game
[3196.36 - 3198.28] P:1896.87 E:0.089660 |  of Euro 2024 against Serbia.
[3198.28 - 3201.80] P:1904.32 E:0.096530 |  They lead by a Jude Bellingham goal to nil at half-time.
[3201.80 - 3205.00] P:1796.51 E:0.091945 |  Second half commentary coming up and the rest of the day's sports news
[3205.00 - 3206.76] P:1760.19 E:0.111929 |  after the BBC News with Karl Hartley.
[3207.64 - 3209.16] P:1220.80 E:0.152375 |  The voice of the UK.
[3209.16 - 3213.24] P:1371.88 E:0.126395 |  And the home of the Euros and the general election 2024.
[3213.24 - 3215.72] P:1596.16 E:0.115427 |  This is BBC Radio Five Live.
[3216.28 - 3217.00] P:1278.14 E:0.085721 |  Thanks, Kelly.
[3217.00 - 3219.48] P:1377.01 E:0.102310 |  Police in Germany are investigating after some
[3219.48 - 3222.84] P:1675.72 E:0.090701 |  England and Serbia fans clashed ahead of this evening's game.
[3222.84 - 3227.48] P:1512.00 E:0.088875 |  Officers say the two groups were separated and seven Serbians arrested.
[3227.48 - 3231.40] P:1447.95 E:0.082632 |  Our sports correspondent, Andy Swiss, who's inside the stadium explains.
[3231.40 - 3236.12] P:1318.44 E:0.107836 |  There have been a few disturbances this afternoon in town,
[3236.12 - 3241.08] P:1046.64 E:0.110961 |  although they seem to be involving Serbian fans rather than England fans.
[3241.08 - 3245.64] P:1108.45 E:0.107791 |  In fact, UK police have issued a statement and they say that at this stage
[3245.88 - 3249.88] P:1428.23 E:0.097816 |  we do not believe that any UK nationals have been arrested.
[3250.60 - 3254.84] P:1716.04 E:0.095211 |  Earlier, German police shot and seriously injured a man who threatened officers with
[3254.84 - 3260.12] P:1695.19 E:0.084616 |  a petrol bomb and small pickaxe near a Dutch fan zone in Hamburg.
[3260.12 - 3263.16] P:1585.07 E:0.091785 |  Officials say the incident is not football related
[3263.16 - 3265.56] P:1731.81 E:0.067620 |  and the suspect is being treated for his injuries.
[3266.44 - 3272.20] P:1685.64 E:0.083250 |  A third food manufacturer has withdrawn certain products because of fears of e-coli.
[3272.20 - 3279.64] P:1638.68 E:0.081775 |  The company, This, has recalled it's This isn't chicken and beer can wraps sold only in W.H. Smith.
[3279.64 - 3283.80] P:1489.22 E:0.074263 |  Around 200 people have fallen ill with e-coli in recent weeks.
[3284.84 - 3290.84] P:1451.41 E:0.097703 |  Dozens of countries attending the Ukraine Peace Summit have used the final declaration to commit
[3290.84 - 3293.64] P:1590.26 E:0.083017 |  to Ukraine's territorial integrity.
[3293.64 - 3298.92] P:1615.12 E:0.083204 |  They called for dialogue, the return of all prisoners by both Kiev and Moscow
[3298.92 - 3303.48] P:1652.73 E:0.082021 |  and for Russia, which wasn't invited to return Ukrainian children.
[3303.48 - 3304.28] P:1755.85 E:0.058165 |  It's taken.
[3304.84 - 3311.48] P:1552.22 E:0.084899 |  Several countries didn't sign the final communique, including India, South Africa and Saudi Arabia.
[3311.48 - 3317.72] P:1481.61 E:0.086549 |  Ukraine's President Zelensky warned that time was not on his country's side in Ending the War.
[3317.72 - 3320.36] P:1899.42 E:0.082874 |  Moving to peace means acting fast.
[3320.36 - 3323.64] P:1831.57 E:0.067546 |  Preparations will take months, not years.
[3324.36 - 3330.52] P:1793.60 E:0.079453 |  So, when the action plans for peace are ready and when every step is worked out,
[3330.52 - 3334.20] P:1773.78 E:0.071040 |  the path will be open for the Second Peace Summit.
[3334.20 - 3336.84] P:1687.89 E:0.065787 |  And thus for Ending this war.
[3337.56 - 3343.16] P:1512.16 E:0.091040 |  An Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he thinks it's unacceptable that his military
[3343.16 - 3348.44] P:1618.01 E:0.080528 |  is introducing daytime pauses in its activity in a part of southern Gaza.
[3348.44 - 3352.20] P:1690.00 E:0.073129 |  The brakes are intended to let aid for Palestinians in.
[3352.20 - 3355.40] P:1639.31 E:0.070448 |  It doesn't apply to Rather, where fierce fighting continues.
[3382.60 - 3384.20] P:1745.11 E:0.123957 |  The best way to watch TV.
[3384.20 - 3385.24] P:1642.73 E:0.101442 |  Push the button.
[3386.20 - 3387.40] P:1394.14 E:0.131883 |  BBC iPlayer.
[3388.36 - 3390.60] P:1511.86 E:0.123614 |  Euro 2024, Deutschland.
[3390.60 - 3391.80] P:1698.90 E:0.120150 |  With Kelly Kips.
[3391.80 - 3393.72] P:1461.59 E:0.122409 |  On Five Life and BBC Sounds.
[3395.48 - 3398.12] P:1674.17 E:0.114339 |  Five Life Sport comes to you from Gelsenkirchen this evening,
[3398.12 - 3401.80] P:1817.84 E:0.098557 |  where England's Euro 2024 campaign is up and running.
[3401.80 - 3405.24] P:1878.47 E:0.091005 |  They lead Serbia by a goal to nil at half time.
[3405.24 - 3408.44] P:1886.47 E:0.092192 |  Second half commentary coming up from here very shortly.
[3408.52 - 3412.68] P:1851.48 E:0.096310 |  On Sports Extra right now, this commentary from the final round of the US Open.
[3412.68 - 3416.28] P:1961.02 E:0.086608 |  Ian Carter is watching and Ian, it's very tense.
[3416.28 - 3417.08] P:1890.79 E:0.126591 |  It really is.
[3417.08 - 3419.96] P:1788.35 E:0.104796 |  Bryson De Chombeau is still at the top of the leaderboard.
[3419.96 - 3425.32] P:1528.13 E:0.095988 |  He's at six under par one over for the six holes that he's played so far.
[3425.32 - 3427.80] P:1689.74 E:0.095446 |  Rory McElroy, just two shots behind.
[3427.80 - 3430.36] P:1517.41 E:0.096495 |  He opened up with a brilliant birdie at the first,
[3430.36 - 3433.96] P:1620.92 E:0.090414 |  but dropped a shot at the par five fifth, where he was very unlucky.
[3433.96 - 3437.72] P:1561.71 E:0.102921 |  Bouncing off the green into an awful lie in the native areas.
[3437.80 - 3440.60] P:1606.14 E:0.100354 |  So he is at four under par, two shots behind.
[3440.60 - 3445.88] P:1681.76 E:0.092593 |  Patrick Cantlay has just picked up a birdie that puts him in a share of second place at four under.
[3445.88 - 3449.00] P:1663.20 E:0.096891 |  The course is proving a real test for these players.
[3449.00 - 3451.48] P:1689.76 E:0.091298 |  Mathieu Pavant, still contending as well.
[3451.48 - 3454.12] P:1854.45 E:0.085256 |  The Frenchman at three under is three shots behind.
[3455.00 - 3456.28] P:1953.15 E:0.120418 |  Thank you very much Ian.
[3456.28 - 3460.84] P:1844.53 E:0.097384 |  Sir Andy Murray says retiring at Wimbledon or the Paris Olympics would be fitting.
[3460.84 - 3465.40] P:1972.56 E:0.096207 |  And he's unlikely to play at the US Open or in the Davis Cup later this year.
[3465.48 - 3468.44] P:1786.31 E:0.096672 |  And Katie Balder has retained her Nottingham Open title.
[3468.44 - 3472.20] P:1893.61 E:0.082202 |  The British number one beat Caroleena Pleskiva in three sets.
[3472.20 - 3476.92] P:1781.94 E:0.096001 |  Back to the Euros and in group A Scotland head to Cologne on Wednesday to face Switzerland
[3476.92 - 3478.76] P:1902.24 E:0.086918 |  in an eight o'clock kickoff.
[3478.76 - 3482.84] P:1799.59 E:0.095759 |  Morale is of course low following that five one hammering by the host Germany
[3482.84 - 3485.32] P:1841.02 E:0.077353 |  in the opening game of the tournament on Friday.
[3485.32 - 3488.52] P:1939.61 E:0.094292 |  Manager Steve Clark has been speaking to the media today.
[3488.52 - 3492.52] P:1898.77 E:0.077992 |  If I could criticise myself and I'll always criticise myself, I'll start with myself.
[3492.60 - 3497.16] P:1832.69 E:0.071654 |  Maybe give too much information, which may be cloudy to players a little bit on the pitch
[3497.16 - 3499.80] P:1677.10 E:0.071451 |  in terms of what we do with the ball, what we do without the ball.
[3499.80 - 3501.00] P:1828.92 E:0.109711 |  So we can work on that a little bit.
[3501.00 - 3502.36] P:1691.91 E:0.105588 |  We worked on a little bit this morning.
[3503.00 - 3506.76] P:1766.99 E:0.074896 |  We'll work on it again in the next two days, going into the game on Wednesday night
[3506.76 - 3509.08] P:1945.32 E:0.070056 |  and hopefully see a different performance.
[3509.08 - 3511.96] P:1931.41 E:0.096069 |  Listen, there are no excuses when you lose a game five one.
[3512.60 - 3513.88] P:1730.48 E:0.088648 |  And I've been in the game a long time.
[3513.88 - 3518.20] P:1887.57 E:0.069343 |  So when you lose a game five one, you have to take all the criticism that comes.
[3518.20 - 3519.08] P:1932.38 E:0.076210 |  You have to respond.
[3519.56 - 3524.76] P:1730.56 E:0.065026 |  The good thing for me is being in this position before, I've always responded pretty well.
[3525.80 - 3527.96] P:1790.54 E:0.088409 |  The players have always responded pretty well.
[3527.96 - 3530.68] P:1775.73 E:0.095095 |  This group of players, they talk about them all the time and how they respond.
[3531.32 - 3532.68] P:2071.30 E:0.057257 |  So that's what we try to do.
[3532.68 - 3536.68] P:2004.23 E:0.100741 |  Sometimes it's difficult to explain to people who are not involved in professional football that
[3537.24 - 3538.84] P:1769.42 E:0.087975 |  they have to be resilient.
[3538.84 - 3543.40] P:1933.49 E:0.085348 |  They have to be resilient because it's a game, especially in club football,
[3543.40 - 3544.60] P:2000.96 E:0.106980 |  it's a game of emotions.
[3545.16 - 3547.72] P:1546.41 E:0.074431 |  So you can have a terrible result on a Saturday.
[3548.44 - 3550.20] P:1759.74 E:0.091271 |  And then you've got to be bouncing yourself back.
[3550.20 - 3552.92] P:1792.43 E:0.105641 |  You've got to be ready to go again on a Wednesday night or a Tuesday night
[3552.92 - 3554.76] P:1947.15 E:0.095948 |  if you're unlucky enough to be playing the championship.
[3555.32 - 3557.00] P:2007.18 E:0.088220 |  Because the games come thinking fast.
[3557.00 - 3559.56] P:1872.57 E:0.091299 |  So it's a game of, it's a roller coaster of emotions.
[3560.28 - 3561.40] P:2061.56 E:0.069773 |  It's the same here.
[3561.40 - 3563.48] P:1507.29 E:0.086871 |  They understand they've let everybody down.
[3564.20 - 3565.16] P:1782.36 E:0.080791 |  They're disappointed.
[3565.96 - 3568.28] P:1711.66 E:0.092916 |  But they know they have to be ready and up for the next game
[3568.28 - 3571.00] P:1591.82 E:0.077643 |  because that's the nature of being involved in football.
[3571.00 - 3574.68] P:1947.37 E:0.063193 |  Kicking a couple of backsides, giving a couple of cuddles,
[3575.24 - 3577.88] P:1652.95 E:0.097405 |  getting them together as a group, making them understand why
[3578.52 - 3581.72] P:1896.30 E:0.068378 |  we had that performance on Friday night
[3581.72 - 3583.48] P:1990.00 E:0.093844 |  and making sure we don't have that performance again.
[3584.92 - 3589.08] P:1871.22 E:0.100649 |  That was Steve Clark speaking ahead of Scotland's game against Switzerland
[3589.08 - 3591.00] P:1838.00 E:0.092604 |  on Wednesday in Cologne.
[3591.00 - 3594.84] P:1912.53 E:0.086728 |  There's commentary of that from eight o'clock on Five Lives Sport.
[3594.84 - 3600.60] P:1843.59 E:0.099388 |  Earlier today at Euro 24, the Netherlands beat Poland by two goals to one.
[3600.60 - 3605.56] P:1921.59 E:0.093898 |  And then in England's group, it finished Slovenia won Denmark won.
[3605.56 - 3607.32] P:1838.76 E:0.087066 |  Denmark opened the scoring.
[3607.32 - 3612.68] P:1837.10 E:0.095682 |  And that goal will be one of these stories of this or any other European championship.
[3613.40 - 3615.24] P:1801.29 E:0.106340 |  Slovenia, Neil, Denmark, Neil Ballforster.
[3615.24 - 3618.20] P:1900.17 E:0.114491 |  Ericsson with his right foot on the half volley.
[3618.84 - 3621.00] P:1820.80 E:0.110345 |  Fantastic goal for Denmark.
[3621.00 - 3627.48] P:1785.22 E:0.112670 |  And what a moment for Christian Ericsson, who three years ago in Copenhagen admitted
[3627.56 - 3630.68] P:1752.27 E:0.114058 |  he thought he'd almost gone from this world.
[3630.68 - 3636.52] P:1913.12 E:0.103951 |  Well, he's right here, right now, runs under the ball, finishes for Denmark
[3636.52 - 3639.08] P:1707.26 E:0.115906 |  and celebrates a superb goal.
[3639.08 - 3641.00] P:1797.81 E:0.111109 |  Slovenia, Neil, Denmark won.
[3641.00 - 3645.08] P:1638.29 E:0.088900 |  I do think this time in the Euro is my story is very different compared to last time,
[3645.08 - 3648.44] P:1826.38 E:0.076798 |  which obviously is a big thing for me personally.
[3648.44 - 3653.16] P:1842.78 E:0.076805 |  But obviously it's been a lot of games since the last time and since that happened.
[3653.16 - 3654.52] P:1772.90 E:0.092694 |  So that hasn't changed.
[3655.16 - 3658.36] P:1667.23 E:0.084201 |  So also the interview I did before, I felt confident going into the game
[3659.16 - 3660.52] P:1705.89 E:0.086054 |  and confident in playing again.
[3660.52 - 3663.24] P:1838.04 E:0.071340 |  So in that sense, I was just happy to be back playing.
[3663.24 - 3666.12] P:1767.02 E:0.075042 |  And obviously qualifying for the Euro is always special for your country.
[3666.12 - 3668.28] P:1644.53 E:0.098418 |  I did have in mind that I hadn't scored that Euro.
[3669.08 - 3673.00] P:1479.44 E:0.084385 |  So obviously that was on my mind, but nothing else than football was on my mind.
[3673.00 - 3675.96] P:1755.65 E:0.090135 |  So I'm really just happy to help the team with the first goal.
[3675.96 - 3679.80] P:1992.94 E:0.080473 |  But yeah, obviously in the end, there would have been a different story for you at the three points.
[3679.80 - 3682.36] P:1878.76 E:0.083831 |  It would also be a lot happier and a lot more confident.
[3682.36 - 3685.40] P:1733.45 E:0.077242 |  But I think it's all the wake up call for us to go into the next game.
[3686.20 - 3691.16] P:1678.11 E:0.093962 |  That was Christian Eriksson speaking after scoring Denmark's opening goal at Euro 2024.
[3691.72 - 3699.56] P:1700.16 E:0.091485 |  1,100 days after suffering a cardiac arrest against Finland in Denmark's opening match of Euro 2020.
[3699.56 - 3703.00] P:1816.47 E:0.098141 |  And John Murray, while Christian Eriksson has played in games,
[3703.00 - 3705.40] P:1725.70 E:0.087457 |  he's played in significant games since then.
[3705.40 - 3708.92] P:1851.65 E:0.081396 |  And he's played healthily in games since then.
[3708.92 - 3711.00] P:1771.08 E:0.083603 |  This one feels like a milestone.
[3711.08 - 3712.12] P:1882.24 E:0.103468 |  Yeah, very much so.
[3712.12 - 3716.36] P:1790.42 E:0.091870 |  And I had that spelled in the at Brentford, which was really important for him.
[3716.36 - 3718.92] P:1724.51 E:0.103234 |  And then got the move to Manchester United where this season,
[3718.92 - 3721.88] P:1799.87 E:0.092487 |  I mean, he's been very much on the fringes, Christian Eriksson.
[3721.88 - 3726.44] P:1778.50 E:0.094473 |  And I have to say, preparing for the Euros last week when I was looking at Denmark,
[3726.44 - 3729.00] P:1540.44 E:0.099065 |  I was thinking, well, I wonder how much he is actually going to play.
[3729.00 - 3730.52] P:1544.77 E:0.107380 |  But there he was in the starting line-up.
[3730.52 - 3735.56] P:1636.45 E:0.097915 |  So as you rightly say, we've got one of the stories already of the tournament there today,
[3735.56 - 3737.56] P:1686.20 E:0.091494 |  as Ali so brilliantly described.
[3737.64 - 3739.72] P:1800.39 E:0.113455 |  Yeah, lovely story for Christian Eriksson,
[3739.72 - 3744.60] P:1913.64 E:0.107449 |  who opened the scoring for Denmark in their one-all draw earlier today against Slovenia.
[3745.40 - 3747.08] P:1792.40 E:0.123565 |  That, of course, is in England's group.
[3747.08 - 3751.72] P:1720.58 E:0.096545 |  In England, are set to face Serbia, the second half of their gaming group C.
[3751.72 - 3758.12] P:1757.30 E:0.095241 |  Jude Bellingham scored in the first half to make it England one Serbia nil so far in this one.
[3758.12 - 3760.04] P:1640.09 E:0.106236 |  Matt Upsen, as the second half approaches,
[3760.04 - 3763.88] P:1565.98 E:0.095273 |  you described England's performance in that first half as very fluid.
[3763.88 - 3766.84] P:1650.34 E:0.088208 |  The position of the players was very fluid.
[3766.84 - 3769.16] P:1767.25 E:0.090785 |  And I think that's particularly interesting,
[3769.16 - 3772.68] P:1635.76 E:0.102247 |  given how Garis Southgate teams were described in his early days,
[3772.68 - 3777.48] P:1626.17 E:0.098024 |  and that they were very organised, quite rigid, and depended really on set-piece goals.
[3777.48 - 3778.92] P:1730.75 E:0.114796 |  Yeah, I agree with that.
[3778.92 - 3782.60] P:1602.17 E:0.090002 |  I think the style of the player almost lends itself to it.
[3782.60 - 3785.16] P:1601.42 E:0.098769 |  I think Saka's the one that really holds his position.
[3785.16 - 3786.28] P:1757.19 E:0.099790 |  He loves that touchline.
[3786.28 - 3787.08] P:1511.21 E:0.116794 |  He wants to be wide.
[3787.08 - 3789.16] P:1725.67 E:0.088969 |  He wants those one-on-one situations.
[3789.16 - 3792.20] P:1597.44 E:0.095164 |  But when you look at the likes of Bellingham and Foden,
[3792.20 - 3794.68] P:1715.12 E:0.100037 |  and even Alexander-Arnold to a degree,
[3794.68 - 3796.36] P:1578.20 E:0.096311 |  although he has to have a bit more discipline,
[3796.84 - 3799.72] P:1699.56 E:0.100065 |  you've got the back-up of Declan Rice, who is missed the discipline,
[3799.72 - 3800.92] P:1665.42 E:0.116068 |  who will not go missing.
[3800.92 - 3803.08] P:1760.20 E:0.111006 |  He'll always be in the right place at the right time.
[3803.08 - 3806.68] P:1798.81 E:0.100234 |  So it gives them that flexibility to maybe take up slightly different positions.
[3807.88 - 3809.80] P:1792.13 E:0.114285 |  Well, the lines are open for 6-0-6.
[3809.80 - 3813.00] P:1633.74 E:0.101812 |  You can have your say on England's performance after the final whistle.
[3813.00 - 3818.04] P:1778.10 E:0.105718 |  Chris and Robbie will be here at 10.30 after we've brought you all the reaction to this match.
[3818.04 - 3822.68] P:1804.80 E:0.099231 |  The number is 0808-5909-693.
[3822.68 - 3825.24] P:1700.24 E:0.099572 |  And with you for the second half in Galsenkirkens.
[3825.88 - 3827.88] P:1755.65 E:0.110103 |  Matt Upsen and John Murray.
[3827.88 - 3829.40] P:1773.29 E:0.084319 |  Yes, thank you, Kelly.
[3829.40 - 3834.28] P:1682.70 E:0.101383 |  Hopefully during 6-0-6 we'll bring you the interviews live from down in the tunnel as well
[3834.84 - 3838.84] P:1720.71 E:0.094572 |  on whatever unfolds in the remainder of this match.
[3838.84 - 3843.08] P:1598.77 E:0.101109 |  Where England lead through Jude Bellingham's goal in the 13th minute.
[3843.72 - 3848.76] P:1700.49 E:0.101402 |  Fine header from Bukaj Osaka's cross that was just slightly deflected as
[3848.76 - 3851.56] P:1615.82 E:0.103109 |  as E. Christensen was saying just before halftime.
[3851.56 - 3854.28] P:1618.17 E:0.100221 |  And that was quite significant, wasn't it, that little deflection?
[3854.60 - 3856.84] P:1554.40 E:0.102133 |  Bounced it down and up and across for Bellingham.
[3856.84 - 3862.04] P:1701.91 E:0.100683 |  He gave the trajectory of that ball which was literally perfect for the way and the timing
[3862.04 - 3865.24] P:1640.20 E:0.103014 |  that Drew Bellingham arrived and really powered that header.
[3865.24 - 3869.40] P:1613.25 E:0.101451 |  I mean, it must have been a lovely moment for him just to score that kind of goal in that kind of moment.
[3870.04 - 3873.80] P:1677.43 E:0.112185 |  Dragon Stojkovic is going to make another change here and Gudal is going off.
[3873.80 - 3882.44] P:1711.33 E:0.101500 |  Nemanja Gudal is substituted at halftime and Ivan Illich of Torino is going to replace him.
[3882.52 - 3888.12] P:1745.19 E:0.100700 |  The 23-year-old who actually was at Manchester City as a youngster, you might remember Ivan Illich.
[3888.68 - 3896.52] P:1498.87 E:0.099402 |  But the Torino man, so Gudal, who has been booked and his fitness was an issue.
[3897.80 - 3900.04] P:1407.90 E:0.111517 |  It's been a little bit off the pace, hasn't he?
[3900.04 - 3902.68] P:1419.34 E:0.112039 |  And I think he's a top player. I think he's a really important player for them.
[3902.68 - 3908.20] P:1273.44 E:0.102401 |  But I think he's had two knee surgeries this season and only came back for the last 20 minutes or so
[3908.20 - 3911.48] P:1259.53 E:0.102313 |  of Sevilla's last game of the season.
[3911.48 - 3917.96] P:1397.52 E:0.099288 |  So to then step into this kind of game against the players that he's playing against is a big ask for him.
[3918.84 - 3922.04] P:1520.35 E:0.110934 |  Well, funnily enough, Illich has had a knee problem this season as well.
[3922.04 - 3925.72] P:1447.06 E:0.100297 |  But he's on the number 17 into the midfield, so that's a straight swap.
[3925.72 - 3932.92] P:1499.53 E:0.089196 |  And England, as they started the match with Pickferingol, Walker, Stones, Gae and Trippier,
[3933.00 - 3937.40] P:1498.31 E:0.082605 |  Alexander-Arnolden-Rice, Saka, Bellingham, Foden and Keane.
[3937.40 - 3939.72] P:1336.12 E:0.096190 |  They're running you through the Serbian team in a moment.
[3939.72 - 3947.80] P:1532.32 E:0.084422 |  But second half, very much underway here under the sometimes closed roof of the Arena Ralf Schalke.
[3947.80 - 3951.16] P:1347.18 E:0.092871 |  But it is open today. I think there's a little bit of rain coming in actually,
[3951.16 - 3956.44] P:1452.70 E:0.094032 |  at the moment, through the open roof above our heads, just beginning to get dark in North Rhine,
[3956.44 - 3961.32] P:1409.03 E:0.089915 |  Westphalia, as the ball is played back to goalkeeper Rykovic.
[3961.32 - 3967.96] P:1549.00 E:0.093027 |  So Serbia with Rykovic in goal, the three central defenders, Velkovic, Milinkovic and Pavlovic,
[3967.96 - 3973.08] P:1559.15 E:0.095980 |  then Zivkovic the right wing back, substitute Mladenovic now on the left after Kostic had
[3973.08 - 3980.20] P:1539.90 E:0.084538 |  to go off with an injury. Milinkovic-Savic, Illich and Lukic with Vlahovic and captain
[3980.20 - 3987.96] P:1416.85 E:0.091285 |  Mitrovic with the squad captain, Dusan Kadic, on the bench tonight, the former Southampton man.
[3988.60 - 3992.68] P:1262.28 E:0.094541 |  Serbia in possession inside the England half, but it's one back,
[3992.68 - 3996.60] P:1442.18 E:0.092750 |  Bellingham just stabs it out to Trippier on the left-hand side, it comes back to Bellingham
[3996.60 - 4000.36] P:1415.12 E:0.104574 |  in now this deep-lying position. That hits a marvellous pass to Saka.
[4000.36 - 4003.72] P:1581.66 E:0.098422 |  First-time touch from Saka, back to Alexander-Arnold on the halfway line.
[4003.72 - 4008.92] P:1731.05 E:0.097888 |  He turns, find Keane. Keane only two touches in the first half and this pass hits the referee,
[4008.92 - 4015.24] P:1520.51 E:0.090614 |  Osato, who apologises to Harry Keane and it will be an uncontested drop-off.
[4015.88 - 4021.72] P:1635.50 E:0.095389 |  That pass was on as well and Keane doesn't misplace those passes. It was going right in the path
[4021.72 - 4027.80] P:1508.49 E:0.091135 |  there of Walker on the overlap, but let's just take a little moment for that Drew Bellingham pass.
[4029.00 - 4034.36] P:1435.92 E:0.098010 |  It was a proper drilled grass-cutter, wasn't it? Across the pitch, zipping along,
[4035.32 - 4041.80] P:1379.01 E:0.086992 |  super pass. Technically, the confidence that he has at the moment, he's just on Cloud nine.
[4041.80 - 4043.24] P:1581.55 E:0.074942 |  Yeah, it is.
[4044.60 - 4049.96] P:1565.89 E:0.098544 |  Melanchovic put in a heavy challenge on Bellingham, but he's okay back on his feet.
[4050.92 - 4056.84] P:1553.43 E:0.092864 |  And Serbia in the all-red kit, or at least with the white and blue trim as per the flag.
[4056.84 - 4060.20] P:1607.37 E:0.100574 |  Find the ball to the left-hand side where Melanchovic's savage is able to play it in
[4060.20 - 4064.52] P:1593.60 E:0.098156 |  towards the edge of the box. Lukic is there, but Gage as well comes across anticipated.
[4064.52 - 4068.28] P:1489.84 E:0.099386 |  Great reading of the game there, wasn't it? I mean, he's been so sharp with that, Mark Gahey,
[4069.00 - 4073.88] P:1626.58 E:0.099312 |  super performers from him so far. All those doubts about the kind of partnership almost, Gage,
[4073.88 - 4078.84] P:1476.49 E:0.101357 |  he's just been at the standout performer in that back four. Yeah, Gage and Stonze, this is only
[4078.84 - 4082.68] P:1634.85 E:0.100363 |  the third time that they've started together as central defenders for England, but they have to
[4082.68 - 4087.72] P:1666.33 E:0.102496 |  defend here as Rice puts in an excellent challenge on the edge of the box just to get there. He'll
[4087.72 - 4093.48] P:1656.63 E:0.099829 |  sort of extend at his leg and it's played downfield to Saka, Saka up against Pavlovic. He's already
[4093.48 - 4099.16] P:1562.69 E:0.096947 |  beaten him, all ends up once. Saka has been forced back towards the edge to the half-way line, but
[4099.16 - 4105.72] P:1530.56 E:0.095564 |  the crossfield pass from Saka just gives possession back to Velkovic and Serbia have got it again
[4105.72 - 4110.76] P:1425.48 E:0.110136 |  inside their own heart. It's just those little moments, John, isn't it? This one-nil scoreline,
[4110.76 - 4117.40] P:1484.40 E:0.100385 |  even though England will be happy with a lot of elements to their first half performance,
[4117.96 - 4122.44] P:1482.14 E:0.105170 |  it's just a bit edgy at times because we know it's just these little moments of slight mistake
[4122.52 - 4126.76] P:1456.50 E:0.103478 |  or a real quality piece of play that just brings Serbia back in this game.
[4127.32 - 4133.80] P:1400.31 E:0.094728 |  John Stonze has to tidy up his own slightly misplaced head-at. Pickford underarms it out to
[4133.80 - 4141.64] P:1391.61 E:0.088346 |  Declan Rice. It just turns full 360 degrees. Ball stationary at his feet as he passes the ball
[4142.20 - 4147.80] P:1463.14 E:0.090755 |  to John Stonze who goes back to Jordan Pickford. First-time touch from him and then passes out to
[4147.88 - 4152.28] P:1624.15 E:0.093881 |  Rice who has a look over his shoulder. Malenkovic savages there. Fodin's actually dropped all the
[4152.28 - 4157.00] P:1799.99 E:0.110902 |  way almost to the edge of his own penalty area. Back it goes to Pickford again, boos from the
[4157.00 - 4163.24] P:1754.37 E:0.093856 |  thousands of Serbia fans. Pickford takes his time and then clips one of those passes up towards
[4163.24 - 4168.52] P:1484.90 E:0.096435 |  Harry Kane against Malenkovic, but Malenkovic actually comes out with the ball and back it
[4168.52 - 4174.44] P:1524.38 E:0.096171 |  goes towards the edge of the box. Yes, apparently, Opta reckon that Harry Kane had just two touches
[4174.44 - 4180.36] P:1418.46 E:0.097611 |  in the first half. Yep, I would say that felt about right and a lot of his movement was just
[4180.36 - 4186.28] P:1541.41 E:0.100360 |  trying to occupy space. I think he's playing a different role because of the players he has
[4186.28 - 4189.48] P:1338.48 E:0.103221 |  behind him. He's not going to be dropping into the area. He's not going to be on the toes of
[4189.48 - 4194.60] P:1507.68 E:0.095284 |  Bellingham, is he? He's going to try and vacate that space to give him the space to operate and
[4194.60 - 4200.36] P:1430.93 E:0.091838 |  Fodin's have come in there. So I think out of all the players, it probably affects him the most,
[4200.36 - 4204.76] P:1690.94 E:0.099028 |  doesn't it? And you've got to be careful with that because he's our most effective player in terms
[4204.76 - 4209.56] P:1513.98 E:0.087532 |  of statistically, but you know, he's figuring it out at the moment, but he's not going to be
[4209.56 - 4215.56] P:1674.88 E:0.107678 |  dropping too deep into that area. Alexander-Arnold is caught in possession and now looking up
[4215.56 - 4219.48] P:1700.87 E:0.093037 |  towards the edge of the box, but Alexander-Arnold actually got back challenged for it and there's
[4219.48 - 4225.24] P:1681.24 E:0.101887 |  a lovely pass forward from Walkout of Saka and Saka takes on Pavlovic, who's just about by hooker
[4225.24 - 4229.56] P:1625.33 E:0.095906 |  by crook, is able to stop Saka breaking forward with the ball and actually did well there.
[4229.64 - 4235.80] P:1662.41 E:0.097898 |  And Pavlovic now buoyed by that recent success comes away with the ball and gives it to
[4235.80 - 4240.28] P:1669.06 E:0.094617 |  Melenkovich Savic and Melenkovich Savic again through the middle England, just getting themselves
[4240.28 - 4246.84] P:1502.69 E:0.098884 |  organised. Ball goes out towards the right-hand side to Zivkovich. Zivkovich, the little right-wing
[4246.84 - 4253.16] P:1515.41 E:0.102894 |  back is able to win a throwing, which he takes himself back to the newly arrived Ilic, Dragan
[4253.64 - 4262.28] P:1352.81 E:0.090607 |  Stojkovich, the Serbia coaches has made two changes now. Again, Zivkovich in towards the
[4263.72 - 4269.80] P:1665.64 E:0.105522 |  corner of the penalty area to Melenkovich Savic and then quite well been, you know, it's not
[4269.80 - 4273.40] P:1478.34 E:0.101585 |  given us a free kick, Bellingham was challenged back to Pickford, Pickford had to be quick there,
[4273.40 - 4278.04] P:1528.99 E:0.097432 |  which he was left-footed ball. This is one for Kane to chase, he's up against Melenkovich,
[4278.04 - 4282.92] P:1679.59 E:0.098055 |  who's able to safely head it back to his goalkeeper. Last two times he's gone back to Pickford,
[4282.92 - 4287.80] P:1539.16 E:0.098528 |  he's gone long and I think it's been a really savvy decision. Players are dropping short,
[4287.80 - 4292.44] P:1566.27 E:0.098754 |  we know how teams play in and around your own 18-yard box, Foden's dropping onto the edge of
[4292.44 - 4297.80] P:1588.17 E:0.097724 |  his own 18-yard box. The game's poised in that way where you don't want any mistakes in the area
[4297.80 - 4302.28] P:1308.92 E:0.098157 |  of the pitch and I think Pickford's making really wise decisions just to go a bit longer and take
[4302.28 - 4306.84] P:1464.84 E:0.091890 |  the press, you might lose the ball but you're not taking that gamble, which England don't need to do
[4306.84 - 4311.56] P:1616.35 E:0.094785 |  at the moment. England leading by one goal to nil, but Serbia started the second half from a
[4311.64 - 4316.28] P:1659.99 E:0.108044 |  single in here, Blažač is ball right across the edge of the six-yard box, Trippje though able
[4316.28 - 4321.96] P:1693.36 E:0.109100 |  to control it for England and was able to clear it but then it's won back by Pavlović on the edge
[4321.96 - 4326.92] P:1711.86 E:0.107919 |  of the area, Mitrovic now just outside the D, England struggling here but Mitrovic it's a
[4326.92 - 4331.32] P:1623.38 E:0.109249 |  poor ball through into the penalty area and Pickford can easily pick it up. Well for the very
[4331.32 - 4338.84] P:1743.28 E:0.107398 |  first time Blažač showed his quality, rolled Gehe really nicely onto his left foot and fizzes
[4338.84 - 4344.60] P:1693.80 E:0.091205 |  the ball across the six-yard box line, just no touch from the arrival, Mladanović couldn't get
[4344.60 - 4348.60] P:1587.41 E:0.106727 |  on the end of it and England got away with it but a real warning shot from Serbia.
[4350.28 - 4356.52] P:1423.70 E:0.096998 |  Pat Upsen, England defender up here in the commentary box with me, high in the stadium
[4356.52 - 4360.92] P:1508.99 E:0.103339 |  on the dressing room side of the ground, Izzy Kristiansen, England midfielder is watching
[4360.92 - 4365.24] P:1406.01 E:0.100605 |  down from behind the goal, we'll hear from Izzy before too long but England go back towards
[4365.24 - 4368.92] P:1604.32 E:0.102760 |  the edge of that penalty area, England are actually attacking towards the end where all of
[4368.92 - 4373.72] P:1814.71 E:0.101363 |  those England fans are and Izzy Kristiansen as well behind the goal but it crosses the St George
[4373.72 - 4381.72] P:1936.05 E:0.096696 |  everywhere with all of the familiar name places written across the the red cross in the middle
[4381.72 - 4387.40] P:1761.14 E:0.090637 |  of the flag, Pickford inside his own penalty area, right foot it, Sakaž able to head that on,
[4387.40 - 4392.12] P:1647.07 E:0.093964 |  Forden got a touch on it but he was shoulder to shoulder with the defender, Forden crashes to
[4392.12 - 4396.28] P:1532.15 E:0.092534 |  the ground, it's out of play for the throwing to Serbia. There's a much different start to this
[4396.28 - 4400.92] P:1638.70 E:0.095536 |  second half isn't it, Serbia coming out more confident, pressing up high on England wanting
[4400.92 - 4406.84] P:1491.29 E:0.089739 |  to try and win the ball back in England's half, very different to the first half where England
[4406.84 - 4411.40] P:1549.61 E:0.093919 |  had plenty of control possession and they sat off a little bit, it's a real shift from the Serbian team.
[4412.76 - 4418.04] P:1754.38 E:0.102130 |  They've had a real mixed bag of results recently and at the World Cup in Qatar, their first match
[4418.04 - 4421.88] P:1653.20 E:0.102899 |  there as well was against one of the favourites against Brazil, you might remember Ishalas
[4422.36 - 4428.28] P:1717.16 E:0.097805 |  scored both goals as Brazil won 2-0 and now it is Lukic who's able to bring the ball forward but
[4429.16 - 4435.56] P:1472.82 E:0.094000 |  Dalingham's in front of him so Pavlovic receives it on the left hand side and then across it goes to
[4436.36 - 4443.00] P:1333.62 E:0.103256 |  the number 13, Velkovic right side at central defender, Pasey pass for Zivkovic to try and
[4443.00 - 4446.36] P:1484.23 E:0.106827 |  reach but there was no way in the world he was going to reach that and it's all the way through
[4446.36 - 4450.04] P:1333.18 E:0.100356 |  for a goal kick for England. Well these are the moments where England just need to be calm,
[4450.92 - 4455.00] P:1368.08 E:0.102994 |  get a hold of the ball and start to assert a little bit more dominance on this second half,
[4455.00 - 4459.16] P:1383.45 E:0.096240 |  it's been a little bit patchy, a little bit ragged, we could start to look a little bit
[4459.16 - 4464.36] P:1326.95 E:0.096127 |  tired, I wouldn't be surprised if there's a freshening up of legs relatively soon.
[4464.36 - 4469.72] P:1600.29 E:0.097039 |  And who would you be thinking of, you can have a ponder on that because Pikvot takes this goal
[4469.72 - 4475.80] P:1574.63 E:0.093015 |  kick long and high over the halfway line, Kane looking to head it on but he's beaten in the air
[4476.36 - 4485.64] P:1594.05 E:0.089552 |  again by Milankovic and then Kane goes down in the challenge with Mitrovic and wins a free kick,
[4485.64 - 4492.44] P:1436.63 E:0.095270 |  classic Harry Kane, he's very good at making and winning those free kicks. Yes, he does that extremely
[4492.44 - 4497.72] P:1232.13 E:0.107391 |  well, really clever, uses his body so well. And he walks away with a little bit of a
[4499.72 - 4504.68] P:1443.62 E:0.110346 |  perqueness about his stride, England take the free kick back to Kyle Walken out from
[4504.68 - 4511.00] P:1462.72 E:0.103067 |  Sackler and Walken goes back towards the edge of the penalty area. So one nil but England not
[4511.00 - 4518.52] P:1854.70 E:0.102259 |  necessarily at the moment threatening a second goal, Bellingham with it inside his own half,
[4519.64 - 4525.40] P:1805.93 E:0.093547 |  then Gae, Alexander-Arnold still just inside his own territory to the right of the centre
[4525.40 - 4530.20] P:1588.35 E:0.099847 |  circle but then goes for one of those long Trent Alexander-Arnold passes which is
[4530.20 - 4535.16] P:1613.85 E:0.096403 |  chested down by Trippia pushing up from left back, Kane with a first time touch, Bellingham now
[4535.16 - 4540.76] P:1679.50 E:0.098974 |  25 yards out, Foulden back to Bellingham, Rice square from him, Alexander-Arnold right foot shot
[4540.76 - 4546.44] P:1742.92 E:0.096879 |  pushed out by goalkeeper Rykovic, he's right at him but it was hit with power, probably wobbling
[4546.44 - 4550.04] P:1581.68 E:0.098464 |  as well so he just got his hands to it and pushed it back out into the penalty area,
[4550.04 - 4555.72] P:1703.42 E:0.103306 |  better from England, much better, Walken then to Rice, 30 yards from goal, Rice finds the ball to
[4555.72 - 4560.12] P:1658.85 E:0.107038 |  Alexander-Arnold into the box, pulls it back now, Bellingham on his left foot, in comes the
[4560.12 - 4565.00] P:1654.30 E:0.107078 |  challenge from Illich and a good one as well to win it for Serbia. An interesting selection
[4565.00 - 4570.28] P:1675.11 E:0.097951 |  from Trent Alexander-Arnold, he has the touch and waits for the cutback for Bellingham but I just
[4570.28 - 4576.60] P:1721.50 E:0.097682 |  felt that first time right footed cross fired across the six yard box, nice, Serbia were in big
[4576.60 - 4580.52] P:1568.29 E:0.105018 |  trouble then recovering back into their own box, I don't think they would have dealt with it very well.
[4581.00 - 4586.44] P:1368.05 E:0.094084 |  One now England lead and suddenly they've upped it now in the second half,
[4588.60 - 4595.00] P:1443.58 E:0.085018 |  Jude Bellingham, right foot control, little left foot pass to Foulden and then back to the
[4595.00 - 4602.12] P:1618.44 E:0.096400 |  halfway line, lines open for 606 by the way from 1030 or so tonight, Robbie Savage and Chris Sutton
[4602.12 - 4607.08] P:1544.78 E:0.102307 |  standing by, Chris is out here in Germany with us, they want to hear what you think of this
[4607.08 - 4616.20] P:1418.42 E:0.103569 |  England performance, 08 08 5 9 0 9 6 9 3, text 8 5 0 5 8, hashtag BBC 606 as Declan Rice is able
[4616.20 - 4621.24] P:1368.32 E:0.105110 |  to take possession back for England in the centre-surfer. Alexander-Arnold now to the right,
[4621.24 - 4625.96] P:1388.93 E:0.105257 |  it's been a great discussion hasn't it Matt, who would play alongside Rice, Alexander-Arnold has
[4625.96 - 4634.52] P:1396.76 E:0.091446 |  done so far, so very good, Alexander-Arnold again back in field to to Bellingham, passes it behind
[4634.52 - 4638.84] P:1654.39 E:0.091477 |  Foulden, actually Trippie is going to have to come back and get a touch for England, Foulden back
[4638.84 - 4645.96] P:1412.68 E:0.087284 |  to Marguerite on the halfway line and then John Stones is able to receive that from his central
[4645.96 - 4651.48] P:1404.83 E:0.094660 |  defensive partner with no Harry Maguire here in Germany with England this time because of his
[4651.48 - 4657.00] P:1322.64 E:0.095834 |  injury, Trent Alexander-Arnold now goes for a long pass that's looking for Kane but that's over hit
[4657.00 - 4662.92] P:1674.50 E:0.091556 |  from the Liverpool man all the way through to Rykovich, what are you thinking is he
[4663.00 - 4668.20] P:1588.10 E:0.091586 |  Christianson down behind the goal? Well obviously that chance from from Jude Bellingham the cutback
[4668.20 - 4673.72] P:1412.55 E:0.100131 |  but the pass into the space from Declan Rice to Trent Alexander-Arnold on the right-hand side was
[4673.72 - 4678.52] P:1493.00 E:0.106575 |  absolutely delightful and over to my left I'm actually watching some England players warming up
[4678.52 - 4682.20] P:1420.38 E:0.101730 |  and there does seem to be a little bit of intent about what they're doing down there, there's
[4682.20 - 4687.80] P:1569.01 E:0.094676 |  Olly Watkins, Esser, Anthony Gordon, Jared Bowen, I think that gives an indication that
[4687.88 - 4692.76] P:1579.48 E:0.101704 |  Gower Southgate might be looking to add freshness into the final third for England if they don't
[4692.76 - 4697.64] P:1791.17 E:0.099469 |  find a second goal soon. Yeah I think there might be a Serbian change coming as well but here they
[4697.64 - 4701.24] P:1765.17 E:0.115184 |  are on the attack, Marder, into the penalty area, Marder-Arnold, Denovic is ball across,
[4701.24 - 4706.52] P:1765.59 E:0.110907 |  Pickford dives down, gets something on it, Gays there as well and the Serbian players are running
[4706.52 - 4711.88] P:1864.39 E:0.101120 |  to the referee and suggesting that there might have been a foul on Mitrovic who's down inside the
[4711.88 - 4719.00] P:1791.40 E:0.091266 |  box and they've got to be careful because only the captain can run and appeal to the referee
[4719.80 - 4724.52] P:1609.80 E:0.096046 |  and I think Danielio Sato might have something to say about this, Pickford diving down at the feet
[4724.52 - 4729.64] P:1718.62 E:0.090245 |  of Mitrovic, what do you think Matt? Yeah I think Kiran Trippia just gets his legs across and there
[4729.64 - 4735.48] P:1659.13 E:0.091720 |  is contact with Mitrovic but I think Trippia Mitrovic at equal distance, kind of from the
[4735.48 - 4741.24] P:1758.11 E:0.091563 |  ball and he's just trying to shield himself in there, Mitrovic really gambles, he just throws
[4741.24 - 4746.84] P:1623.58 E:0.079118 |  his body in there like a centre forward would do to take the contact and... Well they'll be looking
[4746.84 - 4753.56] P:1624.51 E:0.087636 |  at it, VAR and it's one of the best men, it's the top man actually, Massimiliano Eratti who seems
[4753.56 - 4759.40] P:1685.86 E:0.094342 |  to be the VAR for virtually every match I cover in Europe that he is the top of the tree they say,
[4760.04 - 4765.88] P:1451.77 E:0.087443 |  we've got no indication yet whether VAR will call the referee to the side of the pitch and we've
[4766.20 - 4773.24] P:1590.15 E:0.087188 |  got a screen here that tells us if VAR are going to look at something and the referee is just waiting
[4773.24 - 4777.96] P:1494.36 E:0.095035 |  to restart play, the players have gone for the water bottles, these are quite anxious moments,
[4777.96 - 4782.60] P:1618.77 E:0.089873 |  aren't they? Yeah they are, I mean for the first time it was a tough one because John Stones had to
[4782.60 - 4787.80] P:1546.07 E:0.088958 |  match the run of a player that had momentum going past him, it's very difficult to match that run
[4787.80 - 4792.60] P:1613.98 E:0.090533 |  but he does quite well to stop the cross fully coming in but then it's just that coming together
[4792.60 - 4798.12] P:1599.47 E:0.083722 |  between Trippier and Mitrovic, I think they're in the clear, I think so, it doesn't appear to be
[4798.12 - 4802.68] P:1553.72 E:0.100160 |  like there's any intent on this check at all, even if there is one, they'll be looking but
[4803.56 - 4809.88] P:1784.93 E:0.092467 |  yeah and now we're going to actually have a double change and that's it from Mitrovic, so the man who
[4809.88 - 4815.32] P:1792.90 E:0.095242 |  knows England and the Premier League so well, the former Fulham and Newcastle centre forward,
[4816.36 - 4820.28] P:1560.29 E:0.108008 |  thought he might have won a penalty there but that's the end of his involvement and he'll take
[4820.28 - 4825.16] P:1698.61 E:0.098258 |  off the captain's armband and he'll give it to Dusan Tadic, another former Premier League man
[4825.80 - 4833.08] P:1642.95 E:0.090201 |  and it's a double change, actually Serbia are also bringing on the Milan forward Lukáj Jopic
[4834.04 - 4846.20] P:1783.34 E:0.091327 |  to play up front so the number eight Jopic comes on to win his 36th cap. Wow, that really shows you
[4847.08 - 4853.08] P:1725.00 E:0.091886 |  where Serbia feel this game is going, what a really offensive change, that is from Stojkovic,
[4853.08 - 4860.68] P:1725.82 E:0.087144 |  I mean you've got Tadic in there, Jovic, Vlávic, you know really are going for it to be honest with
[4860.68 - 4866.60] P:1798.12 E:0.097131 |  those changes and I think they sense that England are a tiny bit on the ropes John and that there's
[4866.60 - 4870.28] P:1809.34 E:0.101108 |  something there for them if they really push it and they're going to give it a go here.
[4870.28 - 4876.36] P:1770.38 E:0.103709 |  Yeah and it is Lukáj who's been replaced by Dusan Tadic so it's made four changes now,
[4876.36 - 4885.00] P:1594.07 E:0.093120 |  Dragan Stojkovic so Dusan Tadic, Serbia's most cap player comes on to make his 109th appearance
[4885.00 - 4892.20] P:1567.94 E:0.102824 |  for his country and their record goal scorer, Alexander Mitrovic is now off the field so he
[4892.20 - 4896.68] P:1570.56 E:0.087593 |  can't affect things. I think it's going to be interesting during this World Cup to see how
[4896.68 - 4903.40] P:1709.37 E:0.091970 |  the Saudi players look, you know most squads have got one or two in the case of Serbia who play
[4903.40 - 4910.60] P:1778.47 E:0.095380 |  Saudi Arabia, what did you think Mitrovic? I mean for Mitrovic with his style I don't think it
[4910.60 - 4914.92] P:1517.96 E:0.104982 |  affects him too badly because he's not like an electric mover is he, he just takes up really
[4914.92 - 4919.88] P:1654.66 E:0.098174 |  good positions, I don't think Milinkovic Sabic has been as good as what I would expect from him
[4919.88 - 4924.12] P:1634.81 E:0.096213 |  and whether or not that is that involvement in the Saudi League, the level's not quite the sharpness
[4924.12 - 4929.32] P:1385.35 E:0.083072 |  and the standard isn't quite up there and I don't think he's been particularly effective today for
[4929.32 - 4934.76] P:1366.27 E:0.099083 |  Serbia, I was expecting more from him. I think we'll need a full sample size won't we, all of the
[4934.76 - 4940.60] P:1521.25 E:0.098990 |  matches to make a proper judgement on that. So Dragan Stojkovic has made four changes, Gareth
[4940.60 - 4947.24] P:1506.14 E:0.096280 |  Southgate still waiting to make his first and we are now in the 63rd minute and England still
[4947.24 - 4952.44] P:1440.92 E:0.088005 |  leads through the Jude Dalingham header set up by a combination of Walker and Saka which seems
[4952.44 - 4959.40] P:1434.79 E:0.083252 |  like a long time ago now and Serbia it's been much more even in the second half and Serbia
[4959.40 - 4966.04] P:1492.23 E:0.080392 |  certainly had more of the ball, could barely have had less of it as the ball is played out towards the
[4966.04 - 4973.48] P:1385.95 E:0.090485 |  right hand side. Back to the halfway line it goes to Belkovic and across to Milinkovic,
[4974.12 - 4983.56] P:1581.34 E:0.088801 |  Milinkovic tall, big shoulders, Krukut, Pavlovic and then back to Milinkovic, Krukut almost goes
[4983.56 - 4987.80] P:1605.47 E:0.092966 |  with the territory doesn't it, if you play in central defence for Serbia. What are you saying
[4987.80 - 4993.40] P:1640.92 E:0.105084 |  John, you're not pigeonholing centre backs again are you, needing crew cuts and have to be tall
[4993.40 - 4999.80] P:1556.52 E:0.089310 |  today. Chris Perry incidentally five foot nine, you are right, there you go, here is Milinkovic,
[4999.80 - 5004.04] P:1678.39 E:0.099924 |  then back to Pavlovic, Pavlovic curls one forward down into full back position, nice flick,
[5004.04 - 5008.92] P:1625.93 E:0.095860 |  Milinkovic is under this, Milinkovic goes to the byline, then the cross from the far side,
[5008.92 - 5014.36] P:1730.49 E:0.099630 |  stretching header but it should be headed away and is headed partly away by Kyle Walker out
[5014.36 - 5019.88] P:1714.51 E:0.108367 |  towards the far side. England coming under pressure now after Stojkovic's changes. Yeah they're really
[5019.88 - 5026.04] P:1704.47 E:0.093493 |  sensing it, you know those changes do indicate the mindset where Serbia are and just from England
[5026.04 - 5031.48] P:1623.86 E:0.091399 |  having that piece of possession before that stoppage, they look fresher and I think having the
[5031.48 - 5036.68] P:1670.27 E:0.100637 |  ball just gives them a bit of a breather. Ladanovic on the left swings over a deep cross which is
[5036.68 - 5043.08] P:1664.64 E:0.099272 |  brilliantly taken down by Forden and is on penalty area, dropped over his shoulder and the touch was
[5043.88 - 5047.96] P:1547.51 E:0.094141 |  magnificent and then he volleyed it away over the halfway line. It's the kind of touch you want
[5047.96 - 5052.36] P:1393.45 E:0.091258 |  into having the other box isn't it, but that's how deep he is having to defend the corner of his own
[5052.36 - 5058.20] P:1587.62 E:0.090793 |  18-yard box and drop into that space and every England player taking responsibility at the
[5058.20 - 5062.76] P:1531.53 E:0.100577 |  moment. It has to be said to be organised and difficult to break down but you're not going
[5062.76 - 5066.04] P:1633.23 E:0.106202 |  to be able to stop all of these crosses coming into the box. And here's another one into the
[5066.04 - 5070.76] P:1519.39 E:0.097068 |  penalty area but it's knead away by Stones and then cleared away by Alexander Arnard.
[5070.76 - 5075.64] P:1749.77 E:0.100046 |  We've seen this before, Gareth South getting Steve Holland discussing a change as Tadic takes the
[5075.64 - 5079.88] P:1647.16 E:0.111865 |  ball on on the edge of the area into the box but it ran away, Jovic couldn't have the touch.
[5080.44 - 5086.92] P:1677.99 E:0.098782 |  A better touch there and Joric is in for the equaliser but he just really deflected it through the
[5086.92 - 5091.48] P:1697.73 E:0.107133 |  pick-foot. Well it hanging on by the skin of our teeth at the moment, you almost feel there has to
[5091.48 - 5097.48] P:1863.26 E:0.099834 |  be a change or a change of gear and a change of personnel just to shift it because we're
[5097.48 - 5102.52] P:1850.45 E:0.104048 |  struggling to contain it, it's just too open. Steve Holland has called someone up from the
[5102.52 - 5108.44] P:1746.38 E:0.083657 |  the group of five substitutes, actually is it Conor Gallagher who's getting himself ready.
[5108.44 - 5113.56] P:1800.34 E:0.096567 |  What a take from Harry Kane there, brilliant use of his body, holding off the big
[5114.28 - 5120.52] P:1802.21 E:0.094719 |  crew cut, Malinkovic with himself and brings the ball down so gently with his right foot and then
[5120.52 - 5125.96] P:1706.39 E:0.095995 |  holds him off, draws the foul and it's a much needed break in play for England, get the ball in
[5125.96 - 5131.40] P:1413.96 E:0.092922 |  the opposition half and just take stock at the moment. Yeah England need to reassert themselves
[5131.40 - 5136.36] P:1309.48 E:0.099763 |  in this game, just in the balance right now. England have got the lead, they've got that one goal
[5137.08 - 5142.68] P:1383.28 E:0.097815 |  that they need, certainly the skills of Harry Kane in terms of holding the ball up
[5143.40 - 5148.68] P:1565.92 E:0.092509 |  and it is Conor Gallagher stepping forward to come into the tournament, Walker after the free kick.
[5148.68 - 5153.96] P:1748.02 E:0.111164 |  Now Alexander-Arnold into the box but thanks to the defender Pavlovich but it's gone behind for
[5153.96 - 5159.88] P:1661.76 E:0.109318 |  what actually is England's first corner. Set piece is so important for England with Alexander-Arnold
[5159.88 - 5164.36] P:1647.14 E:0.106554 |  and Rice but this is the first time they've had a chance so let's see what England have been
[5165.32 - 5170.76] P:1727.52 E:0.099907 |  There's nice hold-up play from Kane just to draw the ball in, set it wide and then Alexander-Arnold
[5170.76 - 5175.96] P:1918.84 E:0.102825 |  trying to get the cross in that wins the corner and he's just teeing the ball up on this near
[5175.96 - 5180.36] P:1947.24 E:0.108576 |  side corner, the linesman bearing down over him making sure he's not for any part of the ball
[5180.92 - 5186.52] P:2002.08 E:0.111614 |  outside of that little area that it has to be in by the corner flag, the quadrant
[5187.32 - 5192.68] P:1932.96 E:0.111095 |  referee just blows his whistle and gives Tudor Bellingham a kicking off. His influence has
[5193.40 - 5199.56] P:1886.43 E:0.110297 |  dropped away in the second half and with that England's superiority however they've got a corner
[5199.56 - 5205.24] P:1957.90 E:0.109357 |  from the right so Alexander-Arnold to take this into the edge of the six yard box goalkeeper
[5205.24 - 5210.28] P:1730.53 E:0.094592 |  comes gets a punch on that right fist good distance cleared further away on the edge of the penalty
[5210.28 - 5216.20] P:1664.76 E:0.092236 |  area, Thordan back to Alexander-Arnold still on the right his ball into the penalty area it's headed
[5216.20 - 5221.32] P:1634.18 E:0.100173 |  away actually came off the head of Melenkovich right across his own box and now here is Bellingham
[5221.32 - 5228.04] P:1721.08 E:0.098742 |  with it on the left hand side Bellingham goes one way and the other brilliant kicks on Illich
[5228.04 - 5234.04] P:1779.66 E:0.105331 |  beats him again left footed cross but it's caught plucked out of the sky by goalkeeper Reikovic.
[5234.04 - 5240.12] P:1561.19 E:0.101276 |  Yeah not quite enough on the little thing from Bellingham, lovely footwork I mean he's got this
[5240.12 - 5245.96] P:1612.22 E:0.101532 |  kind of reaction time but when he holds the ball and he sees a player try and make a move to just
[5246.04 - 5251.64] P:1608.47 E:0.089667 |  tow it away he's got the ability to react quicker I mean he's got some twitching him to be able to
[5251.64 - 5254.92] P:1614.75 E:0.096373 |  do that and he's just slowly jogging back in position he's just picked up here because he's
[5254.92 - 5261.56] P:1540.97 E:0.090266 |  realised Serbia are on the ball he needs to get back in position. One Nellingdon lead five live BBC
[5261.56 - 5269.64] P:1610.90 E:0.085142 |  sounds Serbia going out towards Zivkovich on the far side and England are now into the last quarter
[5269.64 - 5274.76] P:1541.00 E:0.095388 |  of the match Zivkovich plays it into the penalty area but it's headed away could head up by stones
[5275.56 - 5280.68] P:1601.62 E:0.102997 |  flicked forward by Malinkovic Zivkovich then down by Forden to Trippier and then Ryse and
[5280.68 - 5286.44] P:1657.13 E:0.108096 |  the pressure pass it forced to pass it out of play throw in to Serbia level with the edge of
[5286.44 - 5290.68] P:1620.22 E:0.101128 |  their own penalty area in England now will make the change and Conagallaga is going to come on for
[5292.60 - 5298.36] P:1752.23 E:0.102411 |  Trent Alexander-Arnold. Yeah I thought it might be a switch with Trent Alexander-Arnold and he's
[5298.36 - 5304.20] P:1702.53 E:0.107862 |  interested in his Gallagher I think it's his energy jog you know we see him play he gets about the
[5304.20 - 5310.12] P:1689.14 E:0.102796 |  pitch with real energy Conagallaga and I think it just needs a bit of that to win the ball back
[5310.12 - 5314.84] P:1820.59 E:0.101896 |  and to apply a bit of pressure we've dropped off a little bit and allowing Serbia to have too much
[5314.84 - 5320.92] P:1911.71 E:0.105897 |  of the ball. What do you think Izzy Kristiansen? Yeah it's interesting because I saw the signal
[5320.92 - 5325.96] P:1782.96 E:0.101398 |  from Gareth Southgate and Steve Holland to the bench to get Conagallaga ready as soon as Serbia are
[5325.96 - 5331.32] P:1558.39 E:0.093671 |  on the attack a few moments earlier he just gets the nod to come in there alongside Declan Rice just
[5331.40 - 5336.76] P:1646.20 E:0.091803 |  to solidify this for England because they are on the back foot at the moment. Yep they're 20 minutes
[5336.76 - 5343.56] P:1619.83 E:0.090259 |  away just over 20 minutes away from an opening win but it's by no means certain Zivkovic to take
[5343.56 - 5350.84] P:1684.29 E:0.082671 |  this throw he's actually going to take it short to Velkovic then back to Zivkovic whose cross is
[5350.84 - 5355.56] P:1576.88 E:0.099723 |  blocked but bounces nevertheless into the penalty area that's lifted across to the back post it's
[5355.56 - 5362.84] P:1646.89 E:0.094345 |  got to be watched by Saka the bouncing ball which it is and then Naidenevic gives it to Pavlovic
[5362.84 - 5366.76] P:1660.19 E:0.109087 |  lovely move from Pavlovic against Conagallaga who's able to block the cross out for a throw in on
[5366.76 - 5373.08] P:1684.56 E:0.095371 |  the left hand side. This is edgy times hanging on edgy times for England it's not comfortable at all
[5374.60 - 5378.92] P:1748.91 E:0.106334 |  throwing Serbia increasing in confidence all of the time
[5379.64 - 5385.24] P:1603.93 E:0.103158 |  Milenkovic and then Zivkovic is balling into the penalty area takes a deflection
[5385.24 - 5390.52] P:1643.67 E:0.096589 |  Pickford comes gets a punch on it and is able to punch it to Saka then it's fired forward but
[5390.52 - 5394.84] P:1674.28 E:0.095624 |  Walker is able to evade it ducks underneath it because the pass came from Milenkovic in the
[5394.84 - 5399.24] P:1613.59 E:0.103206 |  centre circle and it's a goal kick and referee Osato is already on to this he's already on to
[5399.24 - 5405.24] P:1698.09 E:0.085458 |  Pickford and says I'm watching you I know you're about to waste time. Yeah he can sense you but
[5405.24 - 5411.24] P:2016.56 E:0.116174 |  I mean this is where it's at every break in play or ability just to reset and slow the game down
[5411.24 - 5414.68] P:2018.77 E:0.103138 |  England are having to take because we just can't get hold of the ball at the moment we've got no
[5415.32 - 5421.24] P:1637.45 E:0.086640 |  real sustained possession and it's making us look a little bit ragged and tired. Yeah and
[5421.24 - 5425.48] P:1610.74 E:0.104078 |  Bellingham who was imperious in the first half you know his influence certainly has gone out of the
[5425.48 - 5430.68] P:1664.75 E:0.098778 |  game as Harry Kane wins the free kick for England halfway inside the Serbian half. You don't find
[5430.68 - 5436.28] P:1567.22 E:0.089197 |  he's got that exuberance that it all kind of comes at once almost I mean how he performed in
[5436.28 - 5443.88] P:1522.38 E:0.088205 |  that first half was just absolutely outstanding and the energy I kind of mentioned just to steady down
[5443.88 - 5448.52] P:1288.42 E:0.106139 |  a little bit and save it some of it up and you'll see all of a sudden you'll see a surge from him
[5448.52 - 5454.04] P:1590.56 E:0.093110 |  and he'll do something incredible and he is that game winner that game changer player
[5454.12 - 5458.28] P:1618.93 E:0.086058 |  Drew Bellingham so a free kick on the left after Harry Kane was fouled
[5459.56 - 5465.40] P:1591.40 E:0.089222 |  and Phil Forden left footed curls it high into the penalty area towards the back post it's headed
[5465.40 - 5469.96] P:1646.30 E:0.099276 |  away it comes out to Saka who's also dangerous in the first half Saka now left footed ball to the
[5469.96 - 5475.56] P:1691.23 E:0.098564 |  back post backing away Reiss nods it across took a deflection a shout for a handball from Bellingham
[5475.56 - 5479.24] P:1638.12 E:0.097855 |  but I don't think the referee will be interested in that and it deflected to Gorky Barajkovic.
[5479.32 - 5484.20] P:1619.23 E:0.092754 |  There's a hopeful shout wasn't it never going to be a handball nice delivery in from Forden with
[5484.20 - 5489.80] P:1632.55 E:0.081569 |  his left foot really swung it into that back post area. Robbie Savage and Chris Sutton waiting
[5489.80 - 5500.60] P:1369.94 E:0.087211 |  for your calls on 606. Your opinion on England's performance here tonight 08 08 5 9 0 9 6 9 3
[5501.16 - 5506.04] P:1839.17 E:0.108425 |  three more commentaries on five live tomorrow two o'clock five o'clock and eight o'clock
[5506.04 - 5512.52] P:1802.17 E:0.094455 |  Romania Ukraine Belgium Slovakia and tomorrow night this time tomorrow night France play their
[5512.52 - 5519.80] P:1598.60 E:0.084471 |  first match you'll hear that with with me and Matt will be in Düsseldorf which is not too far away
[5519.80 - 5525.40] P:1442.36 E:0.096911 |  from here or about half an hour away from Essen which is where our base in the Rua is and it's
[5525.40 - 5533.16] P:1631.53 E:0.095197 |  about 40 minutes the other way but tonight it's Gelsenkirchen and England and what's turned into
[5533.16 - 5538.68] P:1625.05 E:0.097901 |  quite a tense affair. Saka trying to wriggle away through the middle does well actually against
[5538.68 - 5544.60] P:1625.38 E:0.098145 |  Illich plays the ball back to Bellingham England in no rush here Bellingham gets the ball down
[5544.60 - 5549.40] P:1498.54 E:0.101044 |  and then with his right foot finds Tribya on the left flank Luke Shaw is among the substitutes
[5549.40 - 5556.52] P:1293.80 E:0.096760 |  tonight Forden then back to Rice Ryle Rice walks into the pass to give it back to Tribya back to
[5556.52 - 5561.40] P:1475.03 E:0.102782 |  Declan Rice again Rice low towards the edge of the penalty area due Bellingham back to the box
[5561.96 - 5568.12] P:1395.04 E:0.101633 |  gives it to Forden Tribya again on the left hand side but it's not zippy this by any means the
[5568.12 - 5572.84] P:1559.94 E:0.102805 |  pace of England's passing they're just trying to reassert a bit of authority I think yeah yeah
[5572.84 - 5579.08] P:1779.17 E:0.114809 |  it's just have the ball keep the ball in an offensive area as long as we can have the ball in
[5579.08 - 5585.16] P:1651.31 E:0.102656 |  the opposition half and keep possession we're happy and then also you kind of get your legs back a
[5585.16 - 5589.32] P:1564.29 E:0.115450 |  little bit John when you have the ball this is a lot of hard work that's the goal keeps turning over
[5589.48 - 5594.36] P:1604.93 E:0.114741 |  changing hands you're defending cross in the box you're clearing it and then having to deal with
[5594.36 - 5600.20] P:1573.25 E:0.110200 |  another one Bellingham has pulled up for a foul on on Tadditch there I wasn't sure about that I must
[5600.20 - 5607.80] P:1556.97 E:0.094775 |  say but Tadditch has won the break gig back down to pitch side is he yeah it looks like Jared Bowen
[5607.80 - 5613.56] P:1771.77 E:0.107279 |  is stripping off ready to go he was just receiving some instructions from one of Garas Southgate's
[5613.56 - 5618.44] P:1774.95 E:0.106352 |  technical team yeah it looks like he's coming right on and Eze has been given the nod as well to
[5618.52 - 5622.36] P:1780.32 E:0.110564 |  warm up with a bit more intent yeah he's taking his bib off it looks like as I might be entering as well
[5624.12 - 5628.36] P:1788.55 E:0.109412 |  this is interesting as well it's another attacking change though first by Serbia
[5628.36 - 5634.12] P:1681.32 E:0.096343 |  and Zivkovich the right wing back has come off and it's the the Sparta Prague man who is the player
[5634.12 - 5641.88] P:1508.64 E:0.088777 |  of the year in in the Czech Republic this season Velko Biamantjevic who's come on the number 26
[5642.60 - 5646.76] P:1599.79 E:0.099620 |  here's Tadditch on the far side for Serbia but he's actually given the ball away to Foden who
[5646.76 - 5651.80] P:1487.27 E:0.100606 |  controlled it again brilliantly that was hit at him at pace still deep inside his own half
[5651.80 - 5657.24] P:1541.86 E:0.100888 |  then Tribje does well beats the challenge there Foden in the orange boots stretches forward and
[5657.24 - 5663.40] P:1579.66 E:0.108310 |  is brought down that's a free kick and it's a yellow card for Dusan Tadditch and a free kick for Inge
[5663.40 - 5669.40] P:1525.69 E:0.105823 |  I mean what a first touch isn't it he's got a piece of velcro stuck on the end of his boot I think
[5669.40 - 5674.92] P:1562.75 E:0.107253 |  Bill Foden with that the way he took that ball in absolutely superb and then Tadditch can only
[5674.92 - 5679.32] P:1624.48 E:0.104482 |  just kick through the back of him as he just glides past him picks up his yellow card
[5680.04 - 5685.56] P:1354.85 E:0.101843 |  here's that change that Izzy was telling us about Jared Bohan is about to come on the West Ham
[5685.56 - 5692.52] P:1221.09 E:0.095068 |  man England's number 20 to win his ninth cab he's yet to get off the mark in terms of goals
[5693.32 - 5699.32] P:1646.68 E:0.100316 |  and he it is a straight swap Pukaj Osaka who as we know was injured towards the end of the season
[5699.96 - 5706.12] P:1887.59 E:0.109005 |  but he set up the goal the only goal that we've seen here so far tonight yes a smart move 75
[5706.12 - 5713.24] P:1888.50 E:0.110166 |  minutes he's given a really high level for Kaj Osaka he's looked like his best actually
[5713.24 - 5718.92] P:1797.18 E:0.108731 |  inserted moments his shift of direction his sharpness the way he's going past people certainly
[5718.92 - 5724.28] P:1508.00 E:0.103773 |  in the first half he had Pavlovich on toast and I think that he was a big part of this performance
[5724.28 - 5731.48] P:1402.61 E:0.094950 |  for England right off he comes and Jared Bohan is in for his first taste of the tournament
[5732.68 - 5738.68] P:1592.22 E:0.099603 |  so big day for him big feeling to get involved in this sort of occasion England's first match at
[5738.68 - 5747.80] P:1433.43 E:0.095168 |  Euro 2024 they are winning but it is three points is by no means absolutely certain Pavlovich
[5748.36 - 5752.52] P:1616.72 E:0.111831 |  heads it forward and then there's a free kick on Konigalega in it and England again there's a
[5752.52 - 5758.04] P:1541.48 E:0.109954 |  little bit of frustration there as the ball was thrown away by Melinkovic Savic
[5759.16 - 5765.00] P:1589.28 E:0.107618 |  there's a sloppy foul wasn't it it's giving England a nice way to pause is halfway into
[5765.00 - 5771.00] P:1695.01 E:0.096237 |  the Serbia half in a wide area here's Bohan into the action for the first time the hammer of the year
[5771.00 - 5776.20] P:1786.71 E:0.102781 |  Bohan tries to take it to the bi-lane gets the cross in Kane is there heads against the crossbar
[5776.28 - 5783.80] P:1797.98 E:0.101437 |  and it bounces down and out and away so close Kane absolutely I mean physical you name it
[5783.80 - 5788.36] P:1657.47 E:0.099812 |  there was a defender there but Kane got his head to the ball but couldn't direct it underneath the
[5788.36 - 5793.00] P:1811.82 E:0.102077 |  crossbar well brilliant from Jared Bohan as well I mean this is what he does there's no
[5793.00 - 5797.88] P:1750.18 E:0.099267 |  airs and graces with Jared Bohan he just goes at people gets crosses in the box he flights it
[5797.88 - 5803.96] P:1655.16 E:0.091167 |  beautifully Harry Kane gets up over the defender at the back post powers the head up and it's a
[5803.96 - 5809.16] P:1611.05 E:0.096539 |  solid save from Rakovic in goal he does well to get two hands on it and put it onto the crossbar
[5809.16 - 5814.60] P:1522.65 E:0.095260 |  saved onto the bar well saved excellent save from the the Serbia goalkeeper that must have been about
[5814.60 - 5819.96] P:1531.38 E:0.090226 |  15 yards away from you Izzy yeah the build-up was Jared Bohan's cross was absolutely delightful and
[5819.96 - 5825.16] P:1499.70 E:0.099082 |  then the goalkeeper Rakovic he's just actually fist pumped the air because he knows that's a big
[5825.16 - 5829.48] P:1358.49 E:0.109783 |  big save he tips it onto the bar like Matt said and Harry Kane thought it was nestling into the
[5829.56 - 5834.60] P:1409.16 E:0.102902 |  back of the net but it wasn't to be a classic Kane but Serbia coming forward a deep cross it's
[5834.60 - 5839.80] P:1457.25 E:0.102343 |  over the top of Trippia he's actually headed it out towards the the right hand side and Trippia at
[5839.80 - 5843.88] P:1449.50 E:0.097444 |  the ball went between his legs but he was able to recover played it back to Pickford and Pickford
[5843.88 - 5849.24] P:1618.10 E:0.096143 |  left footed quick gets it away towards the the halfway line where Kane is chasing the ball
[5849.24 - 5857.16] P:1485.51 E:0.099540 |  Malenkovic putting the challenge in on him Serbia coming forward again with Malenkovic savage now
[5857.16 - 5862.52] P:1598.83 E:0.085716 |  the the pass down the right flank England dropped back towards the edge of their own
[5862.52 - 5866.36] P:1589.93 E:0.102208 |  penalty area again Malenkovic savage stabs it in towards the edge of the box but straight into the
[5866.36 - 5871.08] P:1565.09 E:0.098123 |  path of Trippia and then Bellingham turns away with the ball and passes it for to Kane and then
[5871.08 - 5875.40] P:1614.93 E:0.105682 |  Kane has got a lot to do here but he's over the halfway line the England captain still going
[5875.40 - 5879.72] P:1694.96 E:0.103190 |  three Serbian players around him flicks it back to Foden Foden then infield towards Gallagher but
[5879.72 - 5885.48] P:1711.47 E:0.107076 |  Gallagher was on his heels and now Serbia will pull forward Pavlovic again as Serbia chased the
[5885.56 - 5890.68] P:1677.47 E:0.095946 |  equaliser Pavlovic has done well he's beaten Walker but then over hit the pass forward and down it
[5890.68 - 5895.00] P:1604.43 E:0.090780 |  goes into the left back area where Trippia is able to play it forward towards Foden
[5895.80 - 5900.12] P:1645.01 E:0.103235 |  Rice is in space in the middle of the field and receives the ball just taps it forward
[5900.12 - 5906.68] P:1492.16 E:0.078850 |  towards Bellingham Bellingham now as England all in white come forward and Jared Borne that's the
[5906.68 - 5911.72] P:1698.19 E:0.094592 |  voice of Dragan Stojkowicz who you can hear there clapping his hands and shouting just next to where
[5911.72 - 5917.24] P:1914.12 E:0.103854 |  Jared Borne was in possession there's an England man Trippia has gone down England's left back
[5918.36 - 5925.32] P:1700.94 E:0.082696 |  has got an injury problem he doesn't look good either John judging by his expression it looks a
[5925.32 - 5931.24] P:1624.79 E:0.098223 |  little bit uh muscular well we'll find out we'll find out what the state of play is with Luxor I
[5931.24 - 5937.96] P:1469.76 E:0.087834 |  mean it's Joe Gomez who's warming up I think it is down there I don't see sure warming up no so it
[5937.96 - 5944.44] P:1562.80 E:0.087541 |  looks as though it's a straight swap but this this could be a blow for uh for Kieran Trippia
[5945.48 - 5951.88] P:1632.64 E:0.091823 |  who has fought his way back in time to to be fit enough to win a place in the squad for the
[5951.88 - 5959.32] P:1517.74 E:0.079753 |  Euros what what do you think the problem is any idea it it looks like he's just gone down and he
[5959.32 - 5964.76] P:1575.13 E:0.095260 |  kind of was feeling the back of his hamstring area and laid on the floor and put his hands over his
[5964.76 - 5968.84] P:1838.04 E:0.100284 |  eyes as if to say do you know what I mean you kind of have that that body language to go
[5969.48 - 5973.80] P:1851.38 E:0.093449 |  I know I've done something well he's up he's up he's walking off the field hopefully it's just a
[5973.80 - 5979.48] P:1600.27 E:0.092449 |  bit of cramp or something I hope so may well be okay it's been a it's been a tough second half
[5979.48 - 5985.00] P:1478.48 E:0.087424 |  physically because we've not been in control so a lot of reacting a lot of loose clearances that
[5985.00 - 5990.68] P:1529.29 E:0.080838 |  have then been won by Serbia and then we're back on the defense again and he's had to get through a
[5990.68 - 5994.44] P:1744.72 E:0.096016 |  lot of running Kieran Trippia and he's just stretching his hamstrings stretching his hamstring
[5994.44 - 5998.68] P:1462.36 E:0.093217 |  a little bit like for those who remember it when Gordon Stracken scored that goal at the at the
[5998.68 - 6002.92] P:1431.67 E:0.102107 |  World Cup many many years ago and he couldn't jump over the advertising hoarding and he put his leg
[6002.92 - 6007.32] P:1425.54 E:0.095916 |  up on top of the the advertising hoarding and he's stretching it there so we're waiting to see what
[6007.32 - 6012.44] P:1540.94 E:0.104809 |  the story is is that how you stretch your hamstring guitar with you that time well since you since
[6012.44 - 6019.72] P:1609.15 E:0.093684 |  Dr Upson helped me with my recovery yes that's exactly the sort of thing I did England have a
[6019.72 - 6026.20] P:1619.61 E:0.105806 |  look over there and Trippia is coming back onto the field well let's just keep an eye on him 10
[6026.20 - 6031.64] P:1483.02 E:0.099277 |  minutes to go England 10 minutes away from an opening win after Bellingham's early goal that
[6031.64 - 6036.60] P:1613.12 E:0.109404 |  Serbia have really put them under pressure as I think Gallagher did Gallagher handball a ball?
[6036.60 - 6040.52] P:1704.92 E:0.096393 |  I think I think he's done him for a high foot but I mean it was good play from Gallagher he really
[6040.52 - 6045.80] P:1594.56 E:0.087065 |  gets off the ball both players with a high foot okay he's stretching but that's what Gallagher's
[6045.80 - 6050.36] P:1679.95 E:0.095814 |  come on the pitch for to win those kind of loose second balls and apply a bit of pressure
[6050.36 - 6056.52] P:1539.84 E:0.097387 |  to the Serbia midfield in that area. A big sport here in Germany and Gelsenkirk and England winning
[6056.52 - 6061.88] P:1594.27 E:0.102131 |  1-0 big night of sport in North Carolina as well that's your choice of listening tonight sport text
[6061.88 - 6068.20] P:1526.60 E:0.094966 |  that'll be on into well probably up towards midnight and the news is Rory McElroy is now
[6068.20 - 6074.68] P:1633.19 E:0.092724 |  sharing the lead with Bryson Dechampol after after a couple of quick birdies Serbia coming
[6074.68 - 6079.24] P:1665.91 E:0.097253 |  forward ball into the penalty area that's cleared away by Walker so sports extra for the commentary
[6079.24 - 6085.16] P:1608.90 E:0.097366 |  on the US Open where Rory McElroy shares the lead 10 years since he last won a major
[6085.72 - 6090.60] P:1744.33 E:0.097920 |  caddage deep lying position left footed ball stones heads that away comes out to the edge of the box
[6090.60 - 6095.48] P:1764.18 E:0.106060 |  left foot shot is just over the top of the crossbar I think Pickford got a touch on that the shot
[6095.48 - 6100.36] P:1666.11 E:0.102656 |  from Vlavic from just outside the box he did it's a Pickford save it's a corner yeah he couldn't
[6100.36 - 6106.36] P:1710.47 E:0.102464 |  leave it Jordan pick but he had to be certain I think it may have been going over well maybe crossbar
[6106.36 - 6111.16] P:1602.89 E:0.104289 |  it was a decent little save tipped over but Vlavic a couple of times in this game he's just come to
[6111.16 - 6117.32] P:1503.55 E:0.105542 |  life hasn't he shown that he is a quality talent yeah had an excellent season for Juventus they won
[6117.32 - 6123.40] P:1544.63 E:0.096868 |  the cup the Coppa Italia caddage to take this corner from the left hand side England really
[6123.40 - 6128.28] P:1505.96 E:0.100894 |  under pressure now to hang on to this lead that they've got caddage takes it left foot towards
[6128.28 - 6133.08] P:1745.88 E:0.102537 |  the far post that's headed away comes out to the edge of the area and it's headed away inside the box
[6133.72 - 6139.00] P:1757.72 E:0.108600 |  Pickford diving for it it was actually knotted away by Harry Kane in his own six yard area
[6139.00 - 6144.20] P:1758.94 E:0.102620 |  and the the captain is being roundly congratulated after England winner free kick in their own box
[6144.20 - 6151.88] P:1614.31 E:0.095012 |  for getting in the way of that shot well it was a big moment really because he's on target Pickford's
[6151.88 - 6157.80] P:1560.58 E:0.100334 |  behind the ball but Harry Kane just gets his head on it puts it up in the air and then we win a foul
[6157.80 - 6163.96] P:1437.76 E:0.101171 |  in the 18-yard box through the contact Serbia really furious with the referee for giving what
[6163.96 - 6167.64] P:1669.91 E:0.110602 |  they feel was a soft piece of contact and he's actually coming over and having a chat with
[6168.28 - 6175.72] P:1939.42 E:0.120544 |  Stojkovic's teetering on the edge of his technical area yes he is white shirt very white trainers
[6175.72 - 6183.32] P:1816.38 E:0.098605 |  very white trainers black trousers it's a great great player Stojkovic the Serbian coach
[6183.80 - 6190.84] P:1604.03 E:0.098371 |  real talent part of that highly talented Marseille team that Chris Waddle was in here is Jared
[6190.84 - 6195.80] P:1648.63 E:0.104366 |  Bowen into the challenge England win the ball back that's what they need Bowen bringing a bit of
[6195.80 - 6201.32] P:1721.90 E:0.091135 |  West Ham spirit to it long pass from the back gay this is for Bowen to chase but it's headed out of
[6201.32 - 6207.80] P:1869.32 E:0.096891 |  play by Pavlovic I mean he's been great since coming on Jared Bowen he really is he's been direct
[6207.80 - 6212.12] P:1613.88 E:0.099561 |  he's putting his foot in he's getting about trying to win second balls and lose that's what this game
[6212.12 - 6216.28] P:1692.77 E:0.092708 |  is at the moment let's not think about all the nice football and the talent we have this this
[6216.28 - 6222.12] P:1708.03 E:0.093947 |  game at the moment 83 minutes gone it's about doing your job yeah winning second balls grinding it a
[6222.12 - 6227.24] P:1635.78 E:0.092878 |  little bit and hopefully getting a bit of possession and just take the sting out of the last 10 minutes
[6227.24 - 6232.60] P:1750.44 E:0.095191 |  or so of this game yeah Bowen does look fresh look sharp I must say throwing taken by Walker I don't
[6232.60 - 6236.84] P:1585.81 E:0.082271 |  think Bellingham will get there no it's cleared away by Tadditch on the edge of the box England
[6236.84 - 6241.16] P:1515.45 E:0.100945 |  who've been up against it for large parts of this second half Gallagher he's he's tackled
[6241.88 - 6248.60] P:1673.45 E:0.110384 |  Tadditch that incomes Bellingham sliding in on his knees Jude they all shout from the England sections
[6248.60 - 6252.92] P:1597.60 E:0.098322 |  Bowen I bet I'm sure Bowen would love to be able to get a run at Pavlovic in the way that
[6252.92 - 6256.36] P:1839.75 E:0.111830 |  Bukajosaka did in the first half I thought he was there John I thought he had the option he thought
[6256.36 - 6260.36] P:1870.29 E:0.104652 |  about it didn't he decided to be safe and keep the ball but I think just at that moment just get
[6260.36 - 6265.96] P:1640.59 E:0.097147 |  hat in test the big centre back how do you think do you think Trippie is okay by the way over on the
[6265.96 - 6271.08] P:1654.32 E:0.096674 |  far side he's getting through it isn't he and I don't think he I don't think he's kind of stay on
[6271.08 - 6275.56] P:1676.49 E:0.108315 |  the pitch if he really felt he'd done his hamstring in any way nice from Bellingham again turns gives
[6275.56 - 6280.52] P:1613.60 E:0.109085 |  it to Kane Kane's pass is a little short actually and it's slid away towards the halfway line by
[6280.52 - 6286.28] P:1575.56 E:0.107016 |  Gaye comes across Vladovic is putting him under pressure wins a throw in throwing taken quickly
[6286.28 - 6290.44] P:1627.36 E:0.101055 |  England looking a little stretched here but there's a misplace pass Kyle Walker's onto that
[6290.44 - 6294.20] P:1538.01 E:0.096725 |  Walker then to Harry Kane in the centre circle just allows the ball to come to him and then
[6294.20 - 6299.88] P:1730.75 E:0.104455 |  is hold over by Vladovic and Kane wins another free kick that's proving to be very important for
[6299.88 - 6307.16] P:1692.99 E:0.085044 |  England the the free kicks that that Kane is winning and Stukovic was boot I think for something
[6307.16 - 6312.92] P:1723.11 E:0.092623 |  that he said dragon Stukovic so that's another coach boot and that's it Bellingham is coming off
[6312.92 - 6322.12] P:1853.84 E:0.101032 |  the field so Jude Bellingham the goal scorer the man who scored England's first goal in Qatar
[6322.92 - 6328.76] P:1916.95 E:0.111232 |  the man who scored England's first goal here in Germany has been rushed off the field by referee
[6328.76 - 6332.92] P:1867.87 E:0.100437 |  or Sato and I think you thought for a moment that he might be about to be booked yeah maybe
[6332.92 - 6338.84] P:1898.82 E:0.099866 |  I mean he's just had brilliant moments in this game his goal was fantastic what a presence he is
[6338.84 - 6343.72] P:1815.47 E:0.095883 |  for England what a difference he actually really does make in that part of the pitch and I can
[6343.72 - 6348.36] P:1657.76 E:0.089982 |  understand bringing him off in this moment he's obviously had a big few weeks hasn't he and hasn't
[6349.00 - 6354.68] P:1550.73 E:0.097547 |  played in any minutes in the warm-up fixtures so great performance from him really and that means
[6355.40 - 6361.32] P:1717.07 E:0.099154 |  Matt that the 19 year old Kobe Menu of Manchester United the man who scored what turned out with
[6361.32 - 6366.84] P:1468.15 E:0.098927 |  the winning goal in the FA Cup final just a few weeks ago he's on now having come from
[6367.80 - 6374.28] P:1705.32 E:0.115227 |  really nowhere and a bad injury at the start of this season a teenager is sent on Kobe Menu to
[6374.36 - 6382.36] P:1479.72 E:0.109948 |  get his first experience of big senior tournament football and England now have Rice and Menu and
[6382.36 - 6387.32] P:1525.85 E:0.106732 |  Gallagher on in their midfield and I think that tells you everything you need to know about where
[6387.32 - 6393.32] P:1665.42 E:0.098081 |  this game is Rice is a judge to a foul caddage free kick to Serbia just four to the centre circle
[6393.32 - 6400.20] P:1517.30 E:0.103612 |  we've got three and a half minutes of the 90 to play you just see this experience I mean there's a
[6400.20 - 6406.28] P:1514.27 E:0.102746 |  lot of experience on the team here for Serbia on the pitch and you just feel that they're using
[6406.28 - 6410.28] P:1638.87 E:0.107629 |  the tattage there winning the foul using his body not allowing Rice to get to the ball and winning
[6410.28 - 6416.52] P:1706.07 E:0.093854 |  a foul and a free kick and more pressure coming England's way. Foden bolleys the ball away Menu's
[6416.52 - 6421.96] P:1661.14 E:0.097662 |  into his first challenge Foden was able to to turn keeping his own half Foden sets off on a run over
[6421.96 - 6428.60] P:1574.42 E:0.105169 |  the halfway line and then is then body checked by Velkovic Foden goes down free kick to England
[6428.68 - 6434.20] P:1597.20 E:0.097113 |  I think Velkovic may even have made some contact on no it's just into his chest
[6434.20 - 6439.40] P:1747.84 E:0.107835 |  England take the free kick they've lost possession that was careless that was sloppy
[6439.96 - 6445.96] P:1672.64 E:0.081318 |  tattage Malinkovic Savic now back to the halfway line
[6447.96 - 6451.72] P:1387.27 E:0.107346 |  and England are saying to Serbia now what are you going to do how are you going to be able to
[6451.72 - 6456.60] P:1701.73 E:0.105820 |  find a way through as England try to hold out for an opening clean sheet and then it's with a cross
[6456.68 - 6462.04] P:1690.53 E:0.101461 |  excellent header away by John Stones he was up against it there but he he beat Jovic to the ball
[6462.04 - 6467.88] P:1752.20 E:0.100117 |  but Serbia win it back again tattage that's a little short so in steps Jared Bohan and the
[6467.88 - 6473.64] P:1645.55 E:0.097415 |  the ball is out of play off the west hand man for a throw in taken quickly Malinkovic Savic
[6473.64 - 6481.48] P:1594.17 E:0.094043 |  square from him to Ilic now out towards the far side to Velkovic and Serbia again as England
[6481.48 - 6488.76] P:1713.79 E:0.104159 |  just dropped back into position Nadejnavic again on the left hand side beats Bohan Nadejnavic
[6489.32 - 6495.32] P:1775.64 E:0.103248 |  then back to Malinkovic Savic on his right foot sends a shot from 25 yards wide of the top right
[6495.32 - 6501.96] P:1797.74 E:0.096955 |  corner and behind and Pickford comes out and remonstrates with his England team mates well
[6501.96 - 6507.72] P:1934.65 E:0.107540 |  super strike but England will be delighted he's taking the option of shooting there and it going
[6508.52 - 6514.28] P:2020.46 E:0.107282 |  well wide and they can just reset I mean it is really difficult moments for England it's not
[6514.28 - 6522.20] P:1902.51 E:0.098904 |  been an easy second half at all and to hold out if they go through this game we'd not concede in
[6522.20 - 6527.40] P:1537.83 E:0.086270 |  it's a it's a big tick in the box because they've been under so much pressure it's quite reminiscent
[6527.40 - 6533.08] P:1679.00 E:0.090300 |  of the first game at the last euros against Croatia which is also a 1-0 win and England now
[6533.08 - 6540.44] P:1578.57 E:0.089844 |  we're in the 89th minute in fact two seconds to go we're in the 90th minute here's Gallagher
[6541.16 - 6549.88] P:1709.12 E:0.103039 |  Gallagher over there to the far side right lines are open for 606 08 08 5 9 0 9 6 9 3 to talk to Robbie
[6549.88 - 6556.12] P:1863.56 E:0.107480 |  Savic and Chris Sutton about this England performance here tonight is it going to be an opening win
[6556.84 - 6563.80] P:1704.14 E:0.087715 |  really only a matter of a few minutes away from that we'll see shortly how many minutes are going
[6563.80 - 6568.52] P:1683.61 E:0.095932 |  to be added on Walker Walker just puts his foot on the ball on the halfway line all of this experience
[6568.52 - 6573.16] P:1563.16 E:0.092631 |  in the England team players like Walker stones now with a ball at his feet plays it across the
[6573.16 - 6579.32] P:1632.38 E:0.084049 |  mark gay and then forward towards Phil Forden who spent most of the second half in his own
[6580.04 - 6586.04] P:1631.06 E:0.101299 |  half and then Serbia can't keep the ball in on the far side and I see trivia just stretching
[6586.04 - 6590.20] P:1504.56 E:0.099141 |  again over there just off the field one foot in front of the other it's always quite hard to evaluate
[6590.20 - 6595.00] P:1556.62 E:0.097115 |  Phil Forden's performances for England sometimes isn't it it's like a mixture of really four minutes
[6595.00 - 6600.76] P:1780.79 E:0.100188 |  about a time that that's not that's not too bad actually I think England now looking in a little
[6600.76 - 6605.16] P:1787.87 E:0.098887 |  bit more comfortable having the ball for the last minute or so and they just need to get the territory
[6605.88 - 6610.84] P:1682.42 E:0.086558 |  have the ball in the Serbian half get some passes off stretch the pitch a little bit and just
[6610.84 - 6616.68] P:1557.68 E:0.087450 |  see this game out less than four minutes to go for England to record an opening win here in
[6616.68 - 6624.04] P:1541.96 E:0.094640 |  Gelsenkirk and Walker Walker to Gallagher Gallagher to me nice touch Gallagher was fouled after the
[6624.04 - 6629.24] P:1722.21 E:0.097374 |  ball had gone by Malinkovic Savic more applause from the England supporters and looking down on them
[6629.24 - 6636.12] P:1512.47 E:0.093495 |  in the stands to my right in amongst the the blue seats of Schalke standing most of them
[6636.12 - 6643.72] P:1661.48 E:0.106352 |  this is very tense Stubb Walker waits to take this free kick he knows he can't delay this
[6644.28 - 6649.56] P:1609.81 E:0.106198 |  England don't want to pick up needless yellow cards so back it goes to stones inside his own half
[6650.20 - 6653.56] P:1614.01 E:0.108059 |  rolls it out towards Trippia onto his right foot Trippia he has one for
[6654.20 - 6659.00] P:1391.14 E:0.107230 |  for folding the chase but that's headed forward by Serbia and then Gallagher is in he spotted
[6659.00 - 6665.24] P:1427.74 E:0.111850 |  his opportunity there Gallagher the ball bounced off the the Serbian player and Gallagher was in
[6665.24 - 6671.00] P:1557.56 E:0.110736 |  like a flash against Illich and won the free kick he was after I read it brilliantly didn't he Gallagher
[6671.00 - 6675.32] P:1560.55 E:0.114418 |  anticipation there was super he knew the touch was going to go back and he just took a gamble
[6675.32 - 6681.16] P:1562.93 E:0.105779 |  conner Gallagher and little moments like that you know you put a sub sub on and you want them to do
[6681.16 - 6685.64] P:1586.63 E:0.114164 |  a job for you I mean it's really taking responsibility and thinking well this is my job I've got to see
[6685.64 - 6689.80] P:1505.25 E:0.106581 |  this through and help the team and it's done that pretty well since he's come on conner Gallagher
[6689.80 - 6694.76] P:1566.84 E:0.110792 |  yeah conner Gallagher was an unused substitute in all of the matches of the world cut by the way so
[6695.96 - 6700.92] P:1759.59 E:0.096370 |  he served his time now he's on the field winning that important free kick for England
[6700.92 - 6706.92] P:1770.92 E:0.096966 |  one nil England lead five live as Boen can't keep that ball in play didn't have much of a chance in
[6707.48 - 6713.00] P:1632.80 E:0.092823 |  in all truth with the pass to him throwing is taken back by Mladenovic and then forward from
[6713.00 - 6718.60] P:1696.16 E:0.096744 |  Milenkovic up towards the halfway line two minutes of the four have been played now as
[6719.32 - 6726.20] P:1770.40 E:0.097710 |  Tadich finds the path pass to the right-hand side in comes the cross no it's blocked by Trippia
[6726.20 - 6733.88] P:1674.16 E:0.084613 |  excellent work against Bia Manchevic Illich now Illich for Serbia left with it to the left-hand
[6733.88 - 6739.16] P:1786.55 E:0.102128 |  side Mladenovic is there Mladenovic is crossed that's blocked by Boen who got his chest in the
[6739.16 - 6743.64] P:1713.85 E:0.096551 |  way of that one and put it out for a throw I think it's more the stomach actually took it right in
[6743.64 - 6749.32] P:1664.62 E:0.103727 |  the mid-riff there Jared Boen yeah as the throwing is taken Illich is going to try a shot which is
[6749.32 - 6753.96] P:1695.96 E:0.103893 |  blocked by Gallagher ball inside the England box bounces for Boen who just hits it away downfield
[6753.96 - 6760.36] P:1720.15 E:0.098169 |  that's giving possession back to Serbia Serbia now this is urgent really urgent stuff from
[6760.36 - 6765.32] P:1716.82 E:0.099395 |  Dragans Stojkovic's team as Pavlovic wins the throw in on the left-hand side that was blocked
[6765.32 - 6770.28] P:1640.11 E:0.094998 |  out of play by Boen I think he's still feeling that ball into his stomach Illich now in the centre
[6770.28 - 6776.60] P:1627.60 E:0.090816 |  circle England have got everyone back behind the ball we've got one minute to play we're into the
[6776.60 - 6782.12] P:1763.64 E:0.101662 |  final minute of added time England clinging on for the one no win into the box it goes Walker
[6782.12 - 6786.84] P:1688.53 E:0.098811 |  stretching heads it away and then it's hooked away by the left foot of Jared Boen Keane comes
[6786.84 - 6796.20] P:1722.41 E:0.106672 |  across to try and win this and what power blidging that was as as Dragans Stojkovic actually picks
[6796.20 - 6801.08] P:1725.24 E:0.105544 |  the ball up from the pitch the Serbia coach and I wonder what he was going to do there he ran across
[6801.08 - 6805.96] P:1633.71 E:0.103077 |  to Harry Kane who was lying on the pitch just a few yards away and he placed the ball on Kane's
[6805.96 - 6812.12] P:1574.78 E:0.102540 |  chest as he lay on the ground he's won that free kick there Harry Kane brilliantly I mean he's just
[6812.12 - 6818.76] P:1718.53 E:0.105249 |  got his body in exactly the right position felt the contact from Malinkovic it wasn't a lot gone down
[6818.76 - 6827.80] P:1761.11 E:0.105594 |  take the pressure off so England closing in on victory pickford takes this only seconds left now
[6828.44 - 6834.20] P:1516.17 E:0.102506 |  it's been a real real grind for them in the second half as Foden hooks one forward and it's
[6834.92 - 6841.24] P:1719.50 E:0.111694 |  then cleared on the edge of the Serbian penalty area and that's it the final whistle goes here in
[6841.24 - 6847.88] P:1448.55 E:0.113079 |  Kelsen Kierken and England do get their opening win thanks to Jude Bellingham's early headed goal
[6849.40 - 6855.40] P:1552.02 E:0.108254 |  what a struggle it was in the second half Serbia showed what they are made of but England yet
[6855.40 - 6862.36] P:1631.87 E:0.105962 |  again are able to start with a win just like they have now in all four of Garra Southgate's
[6862.36 - 6868.92] P:1592.03 E:0.108245 |  tournaments as the England manager in the previous three the opening win has proved to be the spring
[6868.92 - 6874.92] P:1682.75 E:0.101486 |  ball that has taken them far into the tournament but Matt Upsen what do you think well it just
[6874.92 - 6881.48] P:1517.04 E:0.100478 |  leads me nicely John into thinking about how good this game was for England in terms of what they
[6881.48 - 6887.56] P:1420.14 E:0.113363 |  had to deal with how good moments of the first half really were but the second half they really
[6887.56 - 6893.56] P:1401.31 E:0.109165 |  had to dig deep and they had to soak up a lot of pressure the defence got tested massively as a back
[6893.56 - 6897.88] P:1539.70 E:0.109430 |  for could they deal with it can they get on the end of teams can they get their body in the way
[6897.96 - 6902.92] P:1480.64 E:0.118574 |  it was ugly at times it was a bit rugged but they ground it out and I think that's a really good
[6902.92 - 6908.60] P:1484.80 E:0.119276 |  game for them to experience and to come through leading into a major tournament like this you've
[6908.60 - 6913.80] P:1531.15 E:0.118181 |  been talking all week about how you wanted to see this England team grow into the tournament
[6914.44 - 6918.92] P:1634.07 E:0.110759 |  there've been sayings there haven't there a what potentially lie ahead absolutely there's been
[6918.92 - 6924.52] P:1626.89 E:0.105019 |  big signs both collectively and moments individually we've seen a performance from Jude Bellingham at
[6924.52 - 6930.68] P:1414.71 E:0.101191 |  times which was just sensational Harry Kane done his job the players that came on off the bench I
[6930.68 - 6935.40] P:1479.96 E:0.109143 |  thought Bo and then the Gallagher really played the role they were meant to at that point the game
[6935.40 - 6939.80] P:1631.42 E:0.104910 |  was a bit gone wasn't it it was about just seeing it through grinding out loose balls getting hold
[6939.80 - 6944.60] P:1517.99 E:0.106608 |  of it stretching Serbia putting them on the back foot and I thought all those things happened really
[6944.60 - 6950.84] P:1574.39 E:0.105092 |  well and overall England have to be you know pretty positive over of course the result is a win but
[6951.40 - 6957.16] P:1498.88 E:0.106891 |  they got tested and they came through it yeah so Denmark next on Thursday for England in Frankfurt
[6957.16 - 6962.28] P:1405.21 E:0.115754 |  five live the place to hear that coverage of all of the matches here at the Euros but England
[6962.28 - 6968.84] P:1393.54 E:0.100074 |  their players move away towards all of those thousands of England fans in the stands and
[6968.84 - 6975.48] P:1483.62 E:0.113514 |  Garis Southgate in amongst them all they're going to Pukajosakarasi also going to Phil Fordon my
[6975.48 - 6980.36] P:1536.11 E:0.114338 |  goodness he worked hard here tonight and Garis Southgate puts his arms around him Garis Southgate
[6980.36 - 6986.20] P:1539.14 E:0.114085 |  in his first tournament remember the narrow opening win against Tunisia Harry Kane's late goal in
[6986.20 - 6992.28] P:1597.32 E:0.109768 |  that match do you remember at the Euros England winning 1-0 against Croatia not unlike this do
[6992.28 - 7000.04] P:1533.92 E:0.099972 |  you remember in Qatar as well the 6-2 win against Iran I remember saying there Matt it's not how
[7000.04 - 7008.12] P:1527.33 E:0.094979 |  you start it's how you finish and I think the same applies here Serbia nil England won it's finished
[7008.20 - 7013.72] P:1627.89 E:0.113209 |  as Garis Southgate himself applauds to the England fans and Kelly Cates is here with us
[7013.72 - 7018.68] P:1617.51 E:0.115362 |  up in the stands John Murray and Matthew Upton with commentary of England's victory against
[7018.68 - 7023.48] P:1660.27 E:0.115496 |  Serbia will be joined by Izzy Christensen who's pitch side right in front of the England fans
[7023.48 - 7028.28] P:1657.39 E:0.113690 |  so we might just wait till sweet Caroline dies down a little bit before we try and talk to Izzy and
[7028.28 - 7034.92] P:1803.82 E:0.099019 |  Joe Hart is with us as well Joe what did you make of that good enough yeah good enough some excellent
[7034.92 - 7040.60] P:1780.01 E:0.103054 |  stuff in the first half second half it almost felt like we were we were looking for the result
[7041.32 - 7046.44] P:1895.60 E:0.113169 |  but look we dug in we got the result which is the main thing 1-0 at the start of the tournament
[7047.24 - 7054.60] P:1861.27 E:0.113358 |  our superstar shining let's go Matt look we don't need to overreact to this but it is England so
[7054.60 - 7060.36] P:1912.28 E:0.100621 |  we probably will but in terms of that performance the first half an hour as Joe was saying there
[7060.36 - 7065.24] P:1827.79 E:0.104665 |  was some really excellent football there from England yeah it's the reason they don't carry on
[7065.24 - 7071.00] P:1936.06 E:0.101643 |  with that because the idea is to protect the lead or is it because it's just hard to keep that up for
[7071.00 - 7077.32] P:1824.86 E:0.089872 |  90 minutes of international football yeah I felt it was a kind of a little bit insurgent and you
[7077.88 - 7083.08] P:1807.26 E:0.089432 |  you can't maintain that so it's going to be a little bit up and down I felt we you know fitness
[7083.08 - 7087.88] P:1740.58 E:0.092693 |  wise there's been a little bit of a question mark for me over the over the team as a whole to maintain
[7087.96 - 7093.16] P:1682.58 E:0.094768 |  that kind of tempo and I think that really got tested we looked a little bit leggy at moments but
[7093.16 - 7097.40] P:1705.29 E:0.097862 |  but hung in there and I think as you get the games into your body and you get that that repetition
[7097.40 - 7102.20] P:1718.67 E:0.095613 |  and rhythm of playing I think you get stronger and stronger and I think or I hope this team will
[7102.20 - 7106.36] P:1780.28 E:0.100464 |  do that I think they're capable of doing that they're a really good age but there was certainly
[7106.36 - 7111.16] P:1715.81 E:0.097899 |  some really really positive moments in in that first half is it just about growing into the
[7111.16 - 7116.60] P:1818.62 E:0.105740 |  tournament as much as anything Joe I mean as a group of players but the fans we in the media
[7116.60 - 7120.84] P:1659.95 E:0.103153 |  will kind of pick this performance apart but as a group of players will they go in and take
[7121.72 - 7125.24] P:1781.17 E:0.104570 |  job done and and actually there are plenty of positives you can take from that that are going
[7125.24 - 7130.76] P:1809.86 E:0.106599 |  to help us throughout the tournament yeah 100 look this team the way they're set up as Matti just
[7130.76 - 7134.84] P:1778.40 E:0.102504 |  said they're set up to win this tournament they're not set up to win this game and convince us and
[7134.84 - 7139.40] P:1758.00 E:0.112498 |  get us all singing and dancing that was about getting the result obviously ideally we come here
[7139.40 - 7144.60] P:1837.49 E:0.103643 |  we win 3-0 but look there was times that we had to dig in I felt we were comfortable I didn't feel
[7144.60 - 7149.88] P:1958.07 E:0.107362 |  uncomfortable at any point in the game I felt like we could score if we needed to but look this is
[7149.88 - 7153.80] P:1828.85 E:0.109078 |  the long game and if you've got it if you've got a scrape through a little one-nil every now and again
[7153.80 - 7159.00] P:1916.41 E:0.105718 |  then so be it but you know as we've talked about we've got some young bit exciting players and if we
[7159.00 - 7164.36] P:1894.47 E:0.101507 |  can get a 90 minutes out the boys then they'll blow people away let's head down pitch side now
[7164.36 - 7169.24] P:1840.91 E:0.097833 |  and join Izzy Christensen Izzy the guys are saying here you know it was a performance that was
[7169.24 - 7174.04] P:1842.48 E:0.100778 |  good enough to win good enough to start the tournament but there might well be more to come
[7174.04 - 7179.00] P:1945.72 E:0.092371 |  from this England side what do you think yeah I completely agree I think the first half was
[7179.00 - 7184.36] P:1883.39 E:0.096789 |  absolutely exceptional from England I thought from from minute one to minute 45 the way they moved
[7184.36 - 7189.00] P:1775.65 E:0.089233 |  the ball the way they manipulated Serbia they dropped them right off the plane that you know
[7189.00 - 7194.28] P:1813.64 E:0.087116 |  the ball around the pitch with speed with tempo Jude Bellingham was an absolute joy I mean you
[7194.28 - 7198.52] P:1890.13 E:0.089936 |  know it's no surprise saying that but to do it again on an international stage you know
[7199.24 - 7203.16] P:1809.82 E:0.099637 |  unbelievable and the second half was a little bit more difficult for England they found themselves
[7203.24 - 7206.84] P:1833.42 E:0.092902 |  defending a lot more but I think that's quite a nice space to be in obviously we wouldn't be
[7206.84 - 7211.56] P:1900.82 E:0.093998 |  saying that if Serbia had found the equaliser but I think one-nil clean sheet you know lots to
[7211.56 - 7217.24] P:1886.81 E:0.085967 |  grow lots to build on and I thought in particular the substitutes made such a big impact particularly
[7217.24 - 7221.64] P:1847.01 E:0.090200 |  Conor Gallagher and Jared Bowen Gallagher was exceptional picking up second balls winning
[7221.64 - 7227.00] P:1916.83 E:0.091199 |  fouls getting England territory and it helped them get the the win in the end yeah I want to come
[7227.00 - 7232.52] P:1928.74 E:0.093651 |  back to that but we'll talk about about Jude Bellingham with you Joe because he gets the the goal
[7232.76 - 7237.64] P:1929.72 E:0.100679 |  England fans love him and as he's been been down there but I think his name's sung pretty much
[7237.64 - 7243.08] P:1939.96 E:0.103183 |  more than than any other player in the in the England squad what is it that there is to to love
[7243.08 - 7248.20] P:1857.53 E:0.089631 |  about him from a fans perspective but also as a player look what isn't there to love about him
[7248.20 - 7254.36] P:1910.40 E:0.089604 |  I'm looking at him you know he's exceptional he's he's some player he's some build he's gone to
[7254.36 - 7258.76] P:1916.11 E:0.100370 |  Real Madrid he's stuck the number five on his back he's performed you can tell that they absolutely
[7258.76 - 7263.24] P:2002.93 E:0.098913 |  love him he's he's you know he's worldwide now he's there's no doubt about it but you know what
[7263.24 - 7268.28] P:1983.41 E:0.101039 |  the thing that I can't get over and I'm almost trying to find out if it is true but everyone
[7268.28 - 7273.48] P:2032.47 E:0.102642 |  speaks so highly of him as a person they cannot say you know I pulled Tom Heaton before I said
[7273.48 - 7277.88] P:1922.20 E:0.099831 |  what's the catch for this guy I'm not looking for one don't we wrong well you were asking about it
[7277.88 - 7283.32] P:1825.98 E:0.104616 |  so in a way you were looking for one well I was so pleased with his reaction he was like I can't
[7283.32 - 7289.64] P:1942.04 E:0.090108 |  I can't stress what what a beautiful person he is look let's just look after him let's celebrate him
[7289.64 - 7294.20] P:1936.67 E:0.091266 |  he's got the crowd singing he's got that edge there was four or five six times they were leaving
[7294.20 - 7298.68] P:1867.88 E:0.089383 |  one one on him in the first half and he just dealt with it he just got up and you know what one time
[7298.68 - 7303.64] P:1918.24 E:0.087723 |  he stood his ground he told him let's let's go and um and then the big moment that's not that's not
[7303.64 - 7307.80] P:1847.41 E:0.093658 |  a pretty goalie scored that's someone desire that's someone with courage arriving late bang head of
[7307.80 - 7316.68] P:1957.70 E:0.075549 |  top corner I love I love watching him play yeah for me he's just incredible and that's that almost
[7316.68 - 7321.24] P:1799.82 E:0.081580 |  I'm playing in the park I know it's a bit of a cliche in it you know he's playing like he's on
[7321.24 - 7326.44] P:1802.76 E:0.081061 |  the field in the park but he genuinely doesn't mean I'm watching the replay the goal way before
[7326.44 - 7331.08] P:1810.32 E:0.092183 |  that ball comes in he's running into the box with his hand in the air waving it like I'm here
[7331.08 - 7336.36] P:1851.88 E:0.085683 |  just just put it in there like he plays with this energy and sometimes it's a bit fits and starts
[7336.36 - 7340.36] P:1809.02 E:0.096972 |  because you can't play like that all the time so then he kind of has his break and he has a rest
[7340.36 - 7344.76] P:1823.80 E:0.083602 |  and he might just jog back into position and be out of the play but then he's coming to life again
[7344.76 - 7350.76] P:1910.45 E:0.085225 |  and he's just trying things is it is a joy to watch as Joe said I mean to watch him is just fantastic
[7350.76 - 7355.64] P:1831.83 E:0.099728 |  I wonder if with that playing in the park analogy maybe it's more that he would play on the park
[7355.64 - 7358.92] P:1808.48 E:0.100266 |  as if he was playing in the Champions League final probably than he would play in a Champions
[7358.92 - 7363.48] P:1819.21 E:0.093039 |  League final but the way he was playing in a in a park because it just seems as though that that
[7363.56 - 7368.76] P:1854.74 E:0.093640 |  will to win is is is innate in him it came off in the game but again late on definitely not like
[7368.76 - 7374.04] P:1844.67 E:0.094632 |  anything to to be concerned about as far as as far as we know but as he mentioned the the
[7374.04 - 7380.28] P:1955.69 E:0.085825 |  substitutions there and how well she thought they they worked it was pretty much like for like wasn't
[7380.28 - 7385.24] P:1848.27 E:0.089572 |  it in terms of of the guys that came on for England but what did you think do you think that
[7385.24 - 7389.32] P:1763.56 E:0.096536 |  it brought the extra energy that he needed at that time yeah it really did I think the game was
[7389.32 - 7394.20] P:1840.09 E:0.086741 |  was screaming out for a change jared bowen came on obviously a big moment for him to come on in the
[7394.20 - 7398.04] P:1786.70 E:0.086387 |  tournament and then straight away creating that chance for harry kane down there you know down
[7398.04 - 7403.24] P:1733.29 E:0.088857 |  the right hand side what a what a fantastic save by the way and then connor gallagher I thought he
[7403.24 - 7408.12] P:1747.81 E:0.097324 |  was exceptional he was everywhere wasn't he bought that energy when maybe it was slightly lacking in
[7408.12 - 7412.68] P:1830.84 E:0.088102 |  in the there was there was gaps open that weren't there any there was gaps on the field it was it
[7412.68 - 7416.12] P:1721.69 E:0.099332 |  was looking like a big pitch but when connor gallagher came on the energy that he bought and
[7416.28 - 7419.96] P:1789.22 E:0.090915 |  those second balls those fouls that he was winning they were so important in this victory
[7419.96 - 7424.20] P:1835.32 E:0.093080 |  we just looked a little bit leggy and then the distances were too big between us and the
[7424.20 - 7428.92] P:1904.04 E:0.088639 |  Serbian players and all of a sudden we lost control of the game so for me the changes you could have
[7428.92 - 7431.96] P:1918.03 E:0.095673 |  made the changes five minutes earlier if I'm honest because there was a couple of little scares
[7431.96 - 7437.56] P:1907.67 E:0.079887 |  before that but when they came on that had a great impact jared bowen is just so direct
[7437.56 - 7442.28] P:1875.05 E:0.087425 |  he's no frills he gets the ball he wants to drive it defenders and hurt them and he did that straight
[7442.28 - 7447.72] P:1710.11 E:0.086305 |  away so connor gallagher and and jared bowen playing for starting places instead of tren
[7447.72 - 7453.16] P:1784.94 E:0.092395 |  alexander anald and bakayo saco are they playing for a part in the in the squad are they are they
[7453.16 - 7458.20] P:1679.17 E:0.082341 |  finishes as garrasalke said rather than starters I think they know their place at the moment I would
[7458.20 - 7462.92] P:1664.46 E:0.092359 |  say I mean I mean and it's a good place for them and they're growing into of course they'll have
[7462.92 - 7466.44] P:1692.29 E:0.085076 |  aspirations everyone has aspirations to want to be on the pitch at the start of the game of course
[7466.44 - 7470.76] P:1719.00 E:0.087685 |  they do but they know what their role is at the moment and they want to grab it and develop it
[7470.84 - 7474.28] P:1743.35 E:0.086577 |  and move it on and that for me is you know the strength of a really good squad
[7475.24 - 7480.92] P:1875.41 E:0.086592 |  let us hear now from harry keane harry congratulations sweet caroline is booming
[7480.92 - 7487.32] P:1531.04 E:0.100406 |  around this stadium off-tour winning start was that all tonight was about yeah 100 we knew it's
[7487.32 - 7491.56] P:1744.69 E:0.104761 |  going to be a tough game so be opposed some good threats very physical with the long balls
[7492.44 - 7497.40] P:1748.28 E:0.098962 |  rely on second balls and I thought we dealt with it overall really well there was a spell in the
[7497.40 - 7501.40] P:1763.38 E:0.101600 |  first half where we got camped in our box a little bit and we found it difficult to get out but
[7502.28 - 7506.20] P:1831.30 E:0.103504 |  overall I think we deserved the win and it's in the group like I touched on before it's just
[7506.20 - 7510.04] P:1768.58 E:0.099486 |  about getting through so it's an important win tonight you were so dominant in that first half
[7510.04 - 7514.60] P:1775.02 E:0.094974 |  what do you feel changed in the second the oven they they changed their pressure a little bit they
[7514.60 - 7519.48] P:1660.86 E:0.089917 |  went almost man for man and we couldn't quite keep the ball well enough but it's a tough game
[7519.48 - 7523.72] P:1887.38 E:0.094852 |  they're a good team there's some really good players they have a good structure physical they
[7523.72 - 7529.08] P:1901.91 E:0.092164 |  make it a battle but we stood up to a well clean sheet in any game is important and it's good that
[7529.08 - 7533.32] P:1787.39 E:0.091842 |  we've got one today jubeltingen will get the headlines once again what a performance and a
[7533.32 - 7537.16] P:1771.15 E:0.090597 |  goal from him what's he like playing with him at the moment yeah unbelievable player you know he
[7537.16 - 7542.92] P:1774.74 E:0.092688 |  deserves all the praise he's getting at the moment just the way he plays the confidence he plays with
[7542.92 - 7547.64] P:1816.66 E:0.096235 |  and also the way he affects games you know it's important for for people with playing his position
[7547.64 - 7551.64] P:1859.72 E:0.086564 |  to get goals in the system that's what he does it's a great run into the box and he finished it off
[7551.64 - 7556.12] P:1819.08 E:0.091104 |  nicely you really got that goal in the second half there's been so much talk about england's new
[7556.12 - 7560.44] P:1746.45 E:0.086334 |  look attack and who's going to play around you how does it affect you how the attack plays around you
[7560.44 - 7565.08] P:1781.03 E:0.089513 |  now yeah i think each game will be different you know today i probably stayed a little bit higher
[7565.08 - 7570.20] P:1801.91 E:0.090161 |  allowed uh because they like to defend man for man i wanted to keep them deep so jude and feel could
[7570.20 - 7574.44] P:1862.09 E:0.088997 |  uh play in the pockets trend as well on the right side uh so i think each game will be different
[7574.44 - 7578.60] P:1799.98 E:0.091820 |  sometimes you'll see me drop in sometimes playing higher up but i think today for me was more about
[7578.60 - 7582.52] P:1918.26 E:0.092557 |  you know holding the ball up especially in that second half winning fouls uh and trying to see the
[7582.52 - 7587.56] P:1973.17 E:0.085087 |  game out like we did that was harry kane talking to kelly summers will reflect on that in just a
[7587.56 - 7594.60] P:1867.23 E:0.090870 |  moment but first we're going to go back to the us open and ian carter because it is getting very lively
[7594.60 - 7599.08] P:1815.53 E:0.098766 |  this championship's turning into an absolute classic and at the moment looks like a two-horse
[7599.08 - 7604.60] P:1792.23 E:0.094625 |  race between rory mackleroy who's on a charge and brice and de shambot who's desperately trying
[7604.60 - 7611.32] P:1774.63 E:0.094943 |  to cling on de shambot cannot find a fairway off the tee mackleroy is holding a load of putts at the
[7611.32 - 7617.48] P:1726.15 E:0.087886 |  moment over a hundred feet worth he's had three birdies in the last four holes so mackleroy is at
[7617.48 - 7623.56] P:1655.44 E:0.091367 |  seven under par he's on the 13th tee as we speak de shambos in trouble off the tee on the 12th he's
[7623.56 - 7629.00] P:1784.65 E:0.089529 |  at seven under patrick cantley's just dropped a shot so he's back to four under so it's really
[7629.00 - 7635.32] P:1777.84 E:0.093594 |  between those three but in realistically kelly between mackleroy and de shambot for the us open
[7635.32 - 7640.92] P:1608.06 E:0.094970 |  we're live on sports extra right now bringing coverage of what is turning into as i say an
[7640.92 - 7646.76] P:1523.66 E:0.094050 |  absolute classic ian thank you very much and as you say you can follow that on sports extra we're
[7646.76 - 7651.72] P:1739.07 E:0.095384 |  reflecting on england's 1-0 victory against serbia and gelsen kerkin in their opening match of euro
[7651.72 - 7657.72] P:1896.81 E:0.081489 |  2024 we've just heard from harry kane is he is he christianson's been been pitched so she's behind
[7657.72 - 7664.12] P:1910.35 E:0.092597 |  the goal is he you were there when when harry kane's shot came back off the bar he was so close
[7664.12 - 7669.08] P:1959.04 E:0.076695 |  to getting on the score sheet yeah and it would have been classic harry kane he always has an
[7669.08 - 7674.28] P:1833.13 E:0.083258 |  influence on games and he didn't touch the ball a lot tonight as he's he's alluded to himself there
[7674.28 - 7680.04] P:1799.87 E:0.082696 |  he played a very unselfish role pinning the serbian backline back allowing others to to create but
[7680.04 - 7683.24] P:1560.28 E:0.095615 |  that would have been the moment for him and he couldn't really have done anything better the
[7683.24 - 7688.28] P:1896.94 E:0.087452 |  balling from bowing was was absolutely beautiful and yeah like i said harry kane he generated
[7688.28 - 7693.80] P:1803.60 E:0.086523 |  enough power on it he headed it back across goal but it was a brilliant save onto the bar and that
[7693.80 - 7698.76] P:1739.15 E:0.084466 |  would have been his moment but you know his moment will come in this tournament but his role is so
[7698.76 - 7702.92] P:1823.83 E:0.084476 |  important with the team and the way that he's happy to to do that just speaks volumes of him
[7702.92 - 7707.80] P:1827.05 E:0.088928 |  as a person and as a player yeah you were really impressed matt with with his role in the goal as
[7707.88 - 7713.72] P:1878.53 E:0.084821 |  well weren't you yeah i mean how he describes it there was exactly how i saw his role today he
[7713.72 - 7718.92] P:1896.63 E:0.078801 |  stayed out of that area i think with these players in the team the probably the player it affects
[7718.92 - 7724.92] P:1917.25 E:0.065201 |  the most is him and there's no better player to to lay that down because he's so unselfish and he
[7724.92 - 7729.96] P:1840.00 E:0.077266 |  understands his role and he's collective and and he's humble in how he plays so he's happy to stay
[7729.96 - 7735.08] P:1809.65 E:0.080875 |  out the way let those players do their thing he's there for the killer moment he's not bothered he
[7735.08 - 7739.24] P:1873.47 E:0.086372 |  wants to get on the end i mean nearly scored it was brilliant at the back post peeled off
[7739.24 - 7743.72] P:1822.03 E:0.078947 |  did everything right it was a fantastic save as as joe said and and he's there for those moments
[7743.72 - 7749.00] P:1776.69 E:0.074910 |  but he's such an unselfish player great captain and i thought his performance tonight you could tell
[7749.00 - 7753.40] P:1832.86 E:0.080196 |  he was just trying to occupy that back three to give the space to everyone else and it's just
[7753.40 - 7759.56] P:1766.18 E:0.087935 |  another role for harry kane the way his his england career has has developed to seen him take up all
[7759.56 - 7763.72] P:1785.42 E:0.085576 |  those different positions and that that dropping deep that we've seen him do before wasn't needed
[7763.72 - 7769.24] P:1906.97 E:0.080312 |  today now there's there's real ice in his veins and there's such focus about him i was watching him
[7769.24 - 7774.28] P:1819.75 E:0.076170 |  towards the end of the game thinking you know obviously i want harry kane to score and maybe
[7774.28 - 7779.40] P:1744.89 E:0.084282 |  his movement might be a bit frantic no cool calculated being in the right positions always
[7779.40 - 7784.04] P:1822.60 E:0.082630 |  trying to be ready getting back when needed look there's a real unity around the team and when you've
[7784.04 - 7787.80] P:1915.08 E:0.087275 |  got leaders like himself you know harry of all people is going to be absolutely buzzing with the
[7787.80 - 7792.28] P:1931.03 E:0.083628 |  limelight being almost shared or taken over by jude bellingham he just wants this team to win he
[7792.28 - 7796.52] P:1787.35 E:0.087575 |  wants to be there and he wants to do everything that he can to to help help an england victory
[7797.24 - 7802.68] P:1825.76 E:0.083064 |  is there anything in that england performance tonight matt that that maybe concerns you something
[7802.68 - 7806.84] P:1723.98 E:0.086627 |  that garris south getting his team will be looking at and thinking we need to work on that if we're
[7806.84 - 7811.72] P:1860.52 E:0.078450 |  going to progress in this in this tournament i thought we had a a few loose moments with passes
[7811.72 - 7815.00] P:1783.31 E:0.085134 |  and the ball a couple of times so prior to the phoeden gave it away a couple of times and a
[7815.00 - 7819.08] P:1871.66 E:0.084746 |  couple of other players not just him they i think we could have been better in controlling the game
[7819.16 - 7825.16] P:1922.16 E:0.065977 |  with the ball when it got tough and i thought we looked a little bit tired if i'm honest but then
[7825.16 - 7828.60] P:1710.89 E:0.087689 |  you've got players like like bellingham who's had a massive three weeks he's not played any of the
[7828.60 - 7834.52] P:1918.08 E:0.085300 |  warm-up games he came in you could tell he was so hyped and what that does to you energy wise joe
[7834.52 - 7838.76] P:1822.37 E:0.085544 |  it's like you know as a player you almost got to try and you you don't want to see him be
[7839.64 - 7845.08] P:1913.37 E:0.081046 |  level because he's great to watch but it was a little bit in fits and starts and just being a
[7845.08 - 7850.52] P:1803.50 E:0.076959 |  bit more calculated as a team yeah yeah i agree with you there and i think we could have dovetailed
[7850.52 - 7853.80] P:1780.71 E:0.087555 |  a little bit we could have dovetailed a little bit better when it when it did get like that you
[7853.80 - 7858.12] P:1819.18 E:0.081269 |  know you talked before when jude with the way that he plays um in the fits and bursts that we
[7858.12 - 7861.80] P:1769.90 E:0.086376 |  could have covered him but i felt like towards the end we started working out everyone's how
[7861.80 - 7866.20] P:1919.87 E:0.088073 |  everyone was feeling how everyone's positions were um you know huge shout out to mark gay he
[7866.20 - 7871.72] P:1878.58 E:0.086238 |  told me was exceptional um all the talk when i when i've come over to germany is his name's been
[7871.72 - 7875.72] P:1680.86 E:0.090663 |  coming out of people's mouths all the time with no actual good reason because you know he's had a
[7875.72 - 7879.88] P:1789.18 E:0.088027 |  good season uh he's just the only one that doesn't have all the honors around his neck in that back
[7879.88 - 7884.84] P:1749.72 E:0.086955 |  uh that back four i thought he was brilliant tonight really stepped in uh really calm on the ball
[7884.84 - 7889.64] P:1737.83 E:0.073687 |  and you know john john stones is is top end of world football when it comes to center backs but he
[7889.64 - 7894.44] P:1798.16 E:0.085065 |  was a little bit rusty tonight i thought gay he allowed him to play his game you look john's gonna
[7894.44 - 7898.20] P:1616.07 E:0.094302 |  every every moment every training session he's going to get better and better and the more mark
[7898.20 - 7903.32] P:1803.19 E:0.075320 |  plays the better that partnership will get he was a standout performer for me i agree gay i agree i
[7903.32 - 7908.44] P:1662.35 E:0.082477 |  thought he was absolutely outstanding first half he was and in the second half he didn't put a foot
[7908.44 - 7913.72] P:1798.82 E:0.084493 |  wrong he was absolutely brilliant is he you got a closer look at him in the in the second half
[7914.92 - 7919.32] P:1708.97 E:0.083603 |  yeah i i think that i agree with with the guys i think john stones looked a little bit rusty but
[7919.32 - 7924.76] P:1855.28 E:0.084242 |  i think the players coming into this tournament who you'd expect to be rusty harry cayne you know
[7924.76 - 7928.68] P:1711.74 E:0.087263 |  coming off the back of the injury at the back end of the season uh john stones obviously picking up
[7928.68 - 7935.64] P:1824.75 E:0.080665 |  that knock um both of those players you know slightly off it but i completely you know echo
[7935.64 - 7941.48] P:1814.49 E:0.085647 |  the views of of joe and matt with with gay coming in he just looks so comfortable so composed
[7941.48 - 7945.96] P:1798.44 E:0.094725 |  stepping in when needed to win the ball back dropping off dealing with cross as well but
[7945.96 - 7950.60] P:1886.38 E:0.087289 |  you know but in my position here obviously joe will be able to speak you know more on this but
[7950.60 - 7955.16] P:1808.47 E:0.085126 |  watching the role of pickford communicating with john stones and gay and the button and the
[7955.16 - 7960.84] P:1843.78 E:0.089330 |  fallback trippie and walker it's it's so interesting because he almost controls their movement is that
[7960.84 - 7966.20] P:1838.79 E:0.088991 |  right joe yeah he will do he'll be just giving him an idea of how and when um always given an
[7966.20 - 7969.88] P:1737.73 E:0.086430 |  always given an angle as best he can you know the modern goalkeeper doesn't just stand in the middle
[7969.88 - 7973.96] P:1725.55 E:0.086303 |  and and be available so the boys need to get their heads up because he might be he might be
[7973.96 - 7978.52] P:1727.53 E:0.087020 |  vacating the goal um and i thought gay he was able to stay on the ball he had enough time to look
[7978.52 - 7982.28] P:1859.23 E:0.087259 |  to work out what he was going to do next another shout out to kieran trippie here as well
[7983.00 - 7987.48] P:1644.69 E:0.088181 |  playing out of position i thought towards the end of the game he really shone and made it difficult
[7987.48 - 7990.36] P:1631.82 E:0.086788 |  um because there was a lot coming down that right hand side and obviously
[7990.36 - 7994.76] P:1628.79 E:0.094841 |  sirbio were looking to cross but i felt that we made them cross them at least 30 40 yards out
[7995.32 - 7999.24] P:1537.88 E:0.093412 |  the and and the box was you know we had we had a heavy amount of defenders in there and it made
[7999.24 - 8005.88] P:1642.15 E:0.085874 |  it a lot easier pickford made a couple of really good decisions i felt with the ball where we were
[8005.96 - 8011.72] P:1678.69 E:0.080594 |  trying to show for it and play probably 10 50 minutes into the second half and he could have
[8011.72 - 8015.72] P:1557.07 E:0.086033 |  easily got lured into that because you want to play you want to play i mean we enjoyed a chat
[8015.72 - 8020.36] P:1600.81 E:0.082983 |  about this last night um about over playing and went to play in the right areas and he just put
[8020.36 - 8025.16] P:1819.33 E:0.082033 |  his foot through or tried to hit harry kane or go long we lost turned over possession but it was a
[8025.16 - 8029.56] P:1623.14 E:0.093267 |  decision that i felt was really measured from his his understanding of where the game was at that
[8029.56 - 8033.56] P:1697.18 E:0.085646 |  moment and i think we've come on a long ways a group of players in terms of managing those
[8033.56 - 8037.96] P:1683.44 E:0.085798 |  situations in the game yeah definitely not doing things for the sake of it and yeah what harry was
[8037.96 - 8042.44] P:1827.57 E:0.091705 |  doing in what he talked about in his interview he was creating that unbelievable space where
[8042.44 - 8046.20] P:1715.76 E:0.094918 |  i think jordan will actually be disappointed with his quality that he didn't drop it in because the
[8046.20 - 8050.12] P:1660.38 E:0.092353 |  big number four that harry was fighting with you know when it was in the air it was very physical
[8050.12 - 8053.96] P:1699.39 E:0.086070 |  and difficult battle harry harry did very well but i think one or two times you managed to hit his
[8053.96 - 8058.52] P:1754.89 E:0.086740 |  feet what a player when he gets the ball at his feet and we can turn and go from there 10 15 yards
[8058.52 - 8064.04] P:1689.97 E:0.090002 |  into the serbian half and jordan pickford has been talking to joe is talking to john murray
[8064.04 - 8069.88] P:1635.15 E:0.084062 |  yes here he is we'll go from joe hart to jordan pickford that was uh that was tense jordan didn't
[8069.88 - 8078.12] P:1766.19 E:0.071483 |  you think um yeah a test a great test um you know we've had a lot of us some some of us four
[8078.68 - 8084.60] P:1803.12 E:0.076877 |  majors tournaments we've been in some couple five and a couple of um first time so that's
[8084.60 - 8090.92] P:1649.53 E:0.071609 |  tournament football um we knew it was going to be a competitive game um we showed our class we
[8090.92 - 8096.36] P:1593.09 E:0.077642 |  showed our resilience we we give it our you know we did everything we needed to do at night win
[8096.36 - 8104.20] P:1806.12 E:0.078260 |  get a clean shoot um their keepers made a fantastic save for for h um to go tune it up and um he's
[8104.20 - 8109.64] P:1673.44 E:0.077307 |  made a worldy hat's off to him but we've defended well with block low block everything i think tonight
[8109.64 - 8114.20] P:1421.42 E:0.077938 |  that shows a proper performance you know in tournament football yeah there's a little bit
[8114.20 - 8119.16] P:1565.42 E:0.088282 |  of everything wasn't there and and certainly some some very promising stuff in the first half
[8119.16 - 8126.76] P:1745.08 E:0.077241 |  yeah everyone knows the quality we have um going forward it's off the ball where you realize where
[8126.76 - 8131.16] P:1710.49 E:0.079399 |  when we're good because off the ball we're all working hard together we lose it we're we're
[8131.16 - 8136.44] P:1671.82 E:0.072330 |  getting our shape we're pressed we do everything together you know um to get the ball back and get
[8136.44 - 8142.68] P:1683.68 E:0.079323 |  the shape and um to limit the the opposition and um yeah so off off the ball's more important
[8142.68 - 8146.84] P:1578.96 E:0.076758 |  we're with the ball because you know the the the ability we have on the team and of course clean
[8146.84 - 8152.36] P:1589.35 E:0.086607 |  sheets were such an important part of what england achieved at the euros back in 2021 and that that
[8152.36 - 8158.28] P:1719.29 E:0.090066 |  clean sheet means that that you're now equal with peter shilton for for the most clean sheets at
[8158.28 - 8163.40] P:1374.95 E:0.083285 |  will cup stroke european championships that's that's not bad at all is it yeah it's great
[8163.40 - 8168.92] P:1713.07 E:0.079856 |  great achievement personally it's always great but i'll never take applauded to myself you know
[8168.92 - 8174.28] P:1583.97 E:0.087014 |  i've got a full 11 whoever whoever comes off the bench to help me um i'm there to make saves when
[8174.28 - 8179.72] P:1602.64 E:0.084765 |  the when the lads when the lads need me to be there the lads make blocks as well so it's a team
[8179.72 - 8184.68] P:1655.50 E:0.079164 |  effort but it's a great you know to be up there with peter shilton one of the greats in the game
[8184.68 - 8190.60] P:1577.56 E:0.073803 |  and the uh redwood cap holder um it's a great privilege to be up there but it's a team effort
[8190.60 - 8194.92] P:1599.60 E:0.073949 |  and um keep working hard and we'll go again for the next game to get another clean sheet
[8194.92 - 8200.20] P:1631.58 E:0.078738 |  well done tonight jordan thank you thank you jordan pickford uh callie john thank you very much and
[8200.20 - 8206.44] P:1807.08 E:0.086796 |  joe heart as you said sitting alongside me on on jordan pickford's performance not just tonight but
[8206.44 - 8212.04] P:1721.69 E:0.084960 |  across his england career to get to those sort of numbers that they were were talking about how
[8212.04 - 8216.92] P:1735.20 E:0.089492 |  much of an achievement is that you'll understand that more properly than than anyone else yeah he's
[8216.92 - 8222.12] P:1803.95 E:0.083482 |  been he's been exceptional every time especially in the in the tournament football but um look let's
[8222.12 - 8226.04] P:1844.12 E:0.098411 |  build on that let's jordan needs to be that guy now he needs to go that one stage further it's all
[8226.04 - 8230.28] P:1748.08 E:0.091201 |  very nice having clean sheets and lots of appearances but he'll be hungry for that medal around his neck
[8230.84 - 8234.84] P:1893.43 E:0.092299 |  but you know that doesn't come straight away it doesn't come in the first game of the tournament
[8234.84 - 8239.64] P:1834.36 E:0.090608 |  we've got to build we've got to build and a goalkeeper performing well like he is let's keep going with it
[8239.64 - 8245.24] P:1874.89 E:0.095057 |  and um yeah i'd love to hear him talk there very calm you know very you know very understanding of
[8245.32 - 8249.88] P:1807.39 E:0.091102 |  the moment and um that's the kind of goalkeeper that we need and he also talked about the the
[8249.88 - 8254.12] P:1752.96 E:0.092793 |  support of particularly the defense in front of him mark gaye who you guys have been talking about
[8254.12 - 8259.32] P:1796.66 E:0.091513 |  and praising completed 100 percent of his passes 32 of them you won 100 percent of his jewels there
[8259.32 - 8262.76] P:1498.57 E:0.090437 |  are only two of them and 100 percent of his tackles there was only one of them in the in the first
[8262.76 - 8267.88] P:1760.80 E:0.095077 |  half but it was still an all-round and performance that that caught your eye but is he you asked joe
[8267.88 - 8272.36] P:1787.46 E:0.087157 |  the question about the relationship between jordan pickford and his communication with with his
[8272.36 - 8276.76] P:1682.01 E:0.091201 |  defense particularly with the central defenders in front of him what did you see and hear from
[8276.76 - 8281.80] P:1681.58 E:0.084722 |  your position behind the goal in the first half well it was really interesting because obviously i
[8281.80 - 8286.68] P:1712.96 E:0.098828 |  know him from from everton uh football club as well and you know seen him train a lot seen him in
[8286.68 - 8292.44] P:1843.62 E:0.087717 |  and around finch farm the training base um obviously seen a lot of his games and the the
[8292.44 - 8295.80] P:1759.08 E:0.100399 |  communication he's got with the fans first and foremost the first thing he was doing before the
[8295.80 - 8300.60] P:1908.01 E:0.095835 |  game even kicked off is he was finding that connection with the fans and he he thrives off it and he
[8301.32 - 8305.40] P:1775.28 E:0.096434 |  when the when the england fans were singing england's number one i'm not going to sing it myself
[8305.40 - 8311.56] P:1874.60 E:0.095401 |  but they were singing that and he responds to it he acknowledges it he uses it and he constantly
[8311.56 - 8316.60] P:1846.61 E:0.092684 |  seeks that kind of enthusiasm from the crowd and his performance and then it translates into the
[8316.60 - 8322.04] P:1925.83 E:0.094733 |  game when it when it kicks off and and the way he he's so expressive with his hand gestures and
[8322.04 - 8327.40] P:1955.89 E:0.092459 |  you know you sometimes think like is he too wired up but but he isn't that's what makes him tick and
[8327.40 - 8331.64] P:1899.34 E:0.095719 |  it's what makes him perform and if england are going to go all the way in his competition that
[8331.64 - 8336.04] P:1837.17 E:0.097091 |  man is going to have to have an unbelievable tournament and if anything is to go by it of
[8336.04 - 8341.72] P:1880.28 E:0.091407 |  course it's early days but he looked really focused tonight and there was a real sense of not just
[8341.72 - 8345.48] P:1853.01 E:0.098484 |  from jordan pickford but quite a lot of those england players i noticed here you know at pitch
[8345.48 - 8350.60] P:1817.59 E:0.088678 |  level you know a real sense of hunger of arrogance of let's go one step further than than the last time
[8350.76 - 8358.52] P:1873.83 E:0.091436 |  let's go back to the u.s. Open where there's been another twist ian carter ten long years since
[8358.52 - 8365.64] P:1843.08 E:0.098104 |  rory mackerel won a major championship but maybe just maybe he's birded the short par four 13th to
[8365.64 - 8372.12] P:1871.18 E:0.096251 |  move to eight under par simultaneously brice and the shombo dropping a shot at the par 4 12th the
[8372.12 - 8379.40] P:1775.35 E:0.095922 |  shombo driving onto the green though at the 13th and he's given himself potentially a chance of

[8676.12 - 8680.04] P:1779.00 E:0.094967 |  out there is that something you're having to get used to yeah yeah i think um since i probably started
[8680.04 - 8684.36] P:1799.50 E:0.093841 |  playing at birmingham it's something that i kind of i've had to get used to um before i probably
[8684.36 - 8688.28] P:1846.10 E:0.092955 |  not handled it the best in terms of letting myself get involved in a fight but i think this time
[8688.28 - 8693.08] P:1803.12 E:0.094527 |  and today i felt really calm i felt relaxed i know my teammates have my back so yeah i think i've
[8693.08 - 8697.72] P:1811.70 E:0.095838 |  got to be ready for everything over the next seven or six games now and i'm willing to do whatever

[8729.88 - 8734.04] P:1596.20 E:0.105363 |  and accusations are being thrown and it's almost a bluff it's it's a really like a massive game of
[8734.60 - 8739.64] P:1723.36 E:0.092978 |  pretty much yeah yeah it's like you have to be a little bit like traitors well it came into it

[8764.76 - 8770.76] P:1663.12 E:0.081451 |  because you kind of have to stand your ground and then you're in a group situation someone new who
[8770.76 - 8775.56] P:1593.35 E:0.076165 |  thinks someone is a wolf you've got it if jude belligan's the wolf and i don't know connor gallagher

[8785.64 - 8792.76] P:1547.05 E:0.092687 |  given us that insight john murray in the tunnel in gelsenkirk and has the game at home yeah we've

[8855.72 - 8860.44] P:1724.50 E:0.081351 |  in teams i've been in and it's never really got that intense but i think if it becomes a theme and
[8860.44 - 8865.00] P:1807.72 E:0.086967 |  if it is like joe's saying it's been in the england senior camp for a while i imagine it is getting
[8865.08 - 8869.32] P:1770.29 E:0.078175 |  quite competitive do you know that there is something that's that's quite nice i know john
[8869.32 - 8872.92] P:1561.15 E:0.088610 |  was saying you can get the app for it but there is something quite nice when you we've heard all
[8872.92 - 8877.40] P:1598.70 E:0.075749 |  these stories about england camps where it's been a bit unsettled or where players have been a bit
[8877.40 - 8882.04] P:1627.14 E:0.083877 |  isolated and they've been locking themselves away and they've been playing on their their own consoles
[8882.04 - 8887.08] P:1727.24 E:0.076606 |  and that kind of thing it does there there is something quite wholesome about a sort of you
[8887.08 - 8893.24] P:1689.66 E:0.077126 |  know about an actual tangible board game that the players are all are all getting involved in it
[8893.32 - 8899.40] P:1705.19 E:0.075917 |  like i know it's a bit of a cliche thing to say but it is quite a bonding experience for them
[8899.40 - 8904.20] P:1809.04 E:0.085728 |  well it really is and you need to get used to that life um but all these boys are used to it you
[8904.20 - 8908.36] P:1638.31 E:0.074698 |  know that's that's especially now it's modern day football it's not necessarily tournament football
[8908.36 - 8913.32] P:1725.62 E:0.090078 |  if you've gotten away game home game you're in a hotel so you find ways of coping and and everyone's
[8913.32 - 8917.32] P:1525.30 E:0.087538 |  different um everyone's totally different some people want to always have their door open be around
[8918.20 - 8921.72] P:1626.16 E:0.083331 |  some people want to be locked away just minding their own business speaking to their families
[8921.72 - 8925.32] P:1524.48 E:0.090664 |  but that's they're human beings we've got to understand these boys are brilliant footballers
[8925.32 - 8929.32] P:1762.43 E:0.073499 |  but they're human beings they're finding the best way to cope finding the best way to get the best
[8929.32 - 8933.08] P:1579.64 E:0.083877 |  out of each other and i think the understandings there more importantly not everyone's going to
[8933.08 - 8936.84] P:1719.16 E:0.078988 |  play that game not everyone wants to be screaming and sharing it each other but the ones that do
[8936.84 - 8940.52] P:1668.92 E:0.082199 |  will have fun and the ones that don't be understood and left to do what they need to do that that
[8940.52 - 8945.80] P:1563.35 E:0.076660 |  filters onto the pitch though doesn't it i i believe i i think it has a crossover that you see on the
[8945.80 - 8950.84] P:1443.22 E:0.077991 |  grass and it also it breaks down barriers as well because whenever you've been away for a while you
[8950.84 - 8956.36] P:1686.33 E:0.082289 |  meet up again and those those barriers are there and it was Trent Alexander-Arnold involved in the
[8956.36 - 8961.32] P:1689.99 E:0.082840 |  celebrations with Jude Bellingham and he's talking now to John Murray yes we're just discussing the
[8961.32 - 8966.84] P:1569.43 E:0.090638 |  yeah the wolf game anyway more on that in a moment Trent well done tonight that must be a good feeling
[8966.84 - 8971.32] P:1523.36 E:0.076945 |  to to get off the mark with a win in that way most important thing especially when you're coming
[8971.32 - 8977.40] P:1525.81 E:0.071588 |  into a tournament um i think in the back of everyone's mind is don't lose but with the team
[8977.40 - 8984.20] P:1654.56 E:0.062490 |  and the quality that we've got and who we are as a nation it has to be um that's win so that was
[8984.20 - 8991.08] P:1667.75 E:0.073450 |  our main objective is to is to win um no however people will describe it is is however they will
[8991.08 - 8996.44] P:1555.05 E:0.085266 |  but for us a win is a win and we've earned it we felt like we were putting so much hard work out there
[8998.04 - 9002.20] P:1699.48 E:0.077668 |  and stopped them from playing the way that they wanted to as much as possible and then when you
[9002.20 - 9008.44] P:1567.36 E:0.080829 |  got the quality we've got attacking wires and the players get Bacchio running as um as full back
[9008.44 - 9013.64] P:1793.28 E:0.072698 |  and then drew the raven into the box you know you always got a chance of winning games in that sense
[9013.64 - 9018.76] P:1672.59 E:0.087075 |  and you playing in there you know Gareth Southgame it made it very clear yesterday that this has been
[9018.76 - 9023.40] P:1587.40 E:0.076408 |  a long-term strategy which has been backed up by the fact that he's played you there so often but
[9023.40 - 9028.68] P:1463.71 E:0.087515 |  to to start in a tournament i think for only the second time for you it's been a long time coming
[9028.68 - 9035.00] P:1546.51 E:0.078477 |  doesn't it yeah but it's something we have we have worked on a lot um the past year me um Gareth
[9035.00 - 9039.80] P:1949.19 E:0.084436 |  Steve it's not something that you know just spare the spare the moment we've done a lot of work we've

[9138.04 - 9143.00] P:1535.81 E:0.079812 |  Trent alexander onlady talking about the players around him who he says are the best in the world
[9143.00 - 9150.76] P:1634.96 E:0.073851 |  at what they do helping him to adapt to that that new role but is that role next to deklin rice up
[9150.76 - 9156.12] P:1736.83 E:0.072056 |  for grabs do you think matt is that is that a position if if there is one and it's you know
[9157.08 - 9163.00] P:1734.86 E:0.073111 |  we we all appreciate Trent alexander onlady's great strengths in in the game but this is a
[9163.08 - 9170.00] P:1720.81 E:0.071335 |  new role really for him so is is it something that you think garis
[9170.00 - 9174.36] P:1576.24 E:0.083439 |  it's going to stick to or is of all the positions that the one that is most likely to to change in the tournament
[9174.36 - 9180.76] P:1586.43 E:0.077075 |  goes on i think it's a really interesting thing that they're doing um you're trying to get a player
[9180.76 - 9186.36] P:1604.78 E:0.073100 |  into the team who you love as a talent you can't not like him as a talent is is incredible but you're
[9186.36 - 9191.48] P:1733.44 E:0.077055 |  trying to put him into a role which which is very central it's very important and like i say just
[9191.48 - 9196.52] P:1744.07 E:0.071378 |  receiving that ball with your back to goal or under pressure with the ball coming if you're you get
[9196.52 - 9201.08] P:1754.16 E:0.088110 |  to this level by being in those situations repetitively time and time again making all the
[9201.08 - 9205.80] P:1743.04 E:0.076005 |  mistakes knowing what the right thing to do is at the right time he hasn't quite been through that
[9205.80 - 9213.00] P:1743.44 E:0.059573 |  process so will that jump out and bite at some point and be a problem possibly but that's the
[9213.00 - 9216.84] P:1553.34 E:0.083460 |  gamble and that's the balance you've got to make deciders and managers whether the talent of what
[9216.92 - 9222.04] P:1766.38 E:0.066944 |  he does with his right peg is going to override that and you're going to go with it and and who's
[9222.04 - 9226.84] P:1628.18 E:0.076194 |  to say it's right or wrong i think you know chris Sutton said it you can see both sides i i get it
[9226.84 - 9232.84] P:1741.10 E:0.068897 |  but the repetition of playing in that position in any position you need to have done the yard
[9232.84 - 9236.84] P:1740.12 E:0.076052 |  and know those mistakes know the positions know the little idiosyncrasies that happen
[9236.84 - 9241.56] P:1792.27 E:0.075621 |  on the pitch and know what those right little choices are and he just hasn't had exposure to that
[9242.52 - 9247.40] P:1794.26 E:0.097988 |  Matthew Upson, Joe Hart, Izzy Christensen, thank you very much for your company this evening you've
