 Here we go then, the last 16 between Morocco and Spain. Morocco looking to reach the quarterfinals for the first time in their history. Spain, the winners of course in 2010. What Spain will we see this afternoon as the players stopped over on the far side, early free kick conceded by Hakim Ziesch of Morocco and Spain. We'll have a set piece, Jordi Arbour going down. A little bit excitable right at the start, I don't think he's particularly badly injured there, Ziesch reminding him that he was there. I don't think they've had a kick yet, have they? They may have had a header, they've not had a kick yet. But you expect that's going to be part of the game. These whistles and purges you hear there when Spain round the ball. They're going to have to have very strong throws because they're going to have to keep the halftrack for a while, because Spain will keep the ball. So here is Rodgerie in possession for Spain playing at centre half, as he has done throughout this tournament. And Spain now with La Porte just inside their own half, and we can take you through the line-up. So Morocco with Bono in goal, the back four of Hakimi, Aguierde of West Ham, Zais, the former Walsman and Mazraoui ahead of them. It's Anahi, Amrabat and Amala, Ziesch of Chelsea, Bouffal, formerly of Southampton and in the series, the Sevilla man, who plays his club football in Spain up front as the ball is out on the far side for a Spain throw, a little push there by Jordi Alba. After that Hakimi looks a bit nervous there. You know, considering he's played at a very salt level, he shouldn't be nervous there in the Southamberica Bowl he tried to play out the line. Referee Stoke again for some reason. I think he has got two players, Ziesch, very, very close to him. I don't think they can hit him. So low. Yeah, the noise inside the stadium. I think that's the afters of that little push by Jordi Alba, which Ziesch didn't react to whatsoever, but the referee coming over very quickly, Fernando Rappayini of Argentina and saying, no, none of that. And you can understand why in this cauldron of noise the official is wanting to get on top of things very quickly. I have to say, there was very little in it from Jordi Alba and Ziesch, but the official's aware. What a huge match this is in the noise inside Education City Stadium. Most of it for Morocco. That's why the whistles you can hear because Spain in position. And the big cheer as Ferran Torres is challenged by Sofiambu Falpol out of play for a Spain throw. Spain have Simone in goal, the back four of Llorente, Rodri, La Porte and Alba ahead of them. It's Gavi, Bousquets and Pedri, youth that experience intermingling in that Spain trio in midfield with Torres, the former Manchester City man, Almo and Asensio up front. Spain in position over on the far side, nil, nil. Three minutes played here on five live BBC sounds and across Africa on the BBC World Service. The left hand side comes Spain, very patient in position, but Morocco, well, one thing, and I'm loath to make predictions, but one thing that you would be surprised to see is Morocco panicking at any point in this match as the ball comes forward into the penalty area, cleared away by Ziesch, the big up and under. Spain will pick it back up just outside the penalty area, but it bounces off Asensio and Morocco will tidy up out to the right hand side and then Schraff, Hakimi, one of their star players, teammate of a couple of the Spain squad as well at PSG, Colour Soler and Palace Arabia, both on the bench for Spain today, but such a talented fallback over on that right hand side from Morocco. Spain in possession on the half-way line, but yes, Morocco's World Cup has been utterly marvellous. They finished top of their group, they drew with Croatia, they didn't concede, they beat Belgium, yes, Belgium have been disappointing, but didn't concede, as Pat mentioned earlier, the only goal that's gone in was against Canada, a match that they still won to top the group, Spain in possession still on the half-way line, it was one of those before the tournament, Pat. You'd think they'd be hard pressed to get out of the group, but now we're saying they're the ones that you'd really back if there's going to be an upset in the last 16, it could well be Morocco. Yeah, we actually just started with it, this game is incredible. They have tackled everything, and now they're getting their first break. And here they come down the right-hand side, it's the Chelsea man hacking Zee Esch, just overran it, poor touch, and the ball goes behind for a Spain goal kick, Mill Hill. Zee Esch tried to run outside as man. I don't think I've ever seen that from Zee Esch before, because he's so uncomfortable on his right foot, on that right hand side, he always comes back, comes into his left foot and tries to cross him down. That's the first chance of having to keep the ball, keep the ball at all. But what is, as I say, very noticeable, they are knacking into tackles. They are giving the Spanish no time at all, they're not letting them... If they come with the final touch and get close, every single Moroccan player is in there, they're definitely tackles, not getting half a yard. Here you go, Spain note down the right-hand side with Llorente, good sliding challenge from Roman Saís, and the ball takes a nick off, Marcos Llorente as well, and it will go out for Morocco, goal kick, Mill Hill. 0-0, 5.5 minutes play. Yes, Zee Esch's participation in the World Cup, if you only go back four months or so, was very much in doubt. He'd fallen out with the previous manager, Vahid Halid Hodzic. He'd retired from international duty, quit the national side in February. But that is one of the many plus points you can say about the reign of Valid Regragi, the former Morocco defender, apart from tactics and how they've done at this World Cup, bringing players back into the national fold that had fallen out with Halid Hodzic and Zee Esch, foremost amongst those. Here come Morocco, down the left-hand side, Sophie and Bilfau goes down, there's nothing really in that, and Spain will clear away. They won't keep position, though, and it will be a throw to Morocco, which they take quickly. Left-hand side, midway through the Spain half, but they'll go all the way back to Roman Saís, who will square it to his centre-half partner, Naif Aguard, who will be appearances for West Ham this season. He was another one for different reasons, whose participation was in doubt, missed most of the season with an ankle injury, came back at the end of October, but those two Saís and Aguard very much the heart of that Moroccan solid defence of Spain have it, just inside their own heart, goblets. I know, it suggests the heart-heart as well. They put in the tackle, it's very interesting, they had a goal-kick, Morocco there, they've actually worked on their goal-kicks for a long ball to the left-hand side, they've got three players up for it, and they won it there. Now, I think they were almost preparing for Aspelikweta, with the lack of height to be there, but they still got the knock-on, and it shows you that they work on every part of the game, even their goal-kicks. So, Spain in position in the centre-circle, and Ramon did that, you can watch this match with our commentary on the BBC iPlayer, if you would like to, just search for World Cup Extra, and you'll find the feed that is synced up with our five-live commentary with your pictures, as the ball is with Gavi, just inside the Morocco half. Spain work it now to Pedring, it's all very neat and tidy, but Morocco in good shape. Spain trying to thread the ball through that red wall, those banks of five and four, as they work it out to this right-hand side. And here is Ferran Torres, who's a manches to City Man, lovely footwork into the penalty area, and tried the cute little back heel, and Spain will concede the free-kick inside the Morocco penalty area, Sofiane Amrabat going down, but that was nice from Torres. It was Brita Wall, he walks in there, and there's a red wall in front of him. As I say, if you get into the dangerous positions, they will close you down, but not one, not two. It's something three, something four. He's very, very little space out, so he did one little trick, but he needs more than one, he needs about three or four in the row there. I think there is one weakness that can begin to see one possible weakness in that back line of the Moroccans. When they hold the line, it is about 20 yards outside the 18-yard line, there's a gap there. If you had an Iniesta plane, I would be worried sick. They've not gotten an Iniesta plane, but they've got two players, so you never know, that ball just over the top may well be on for Spain at one point. Spain in position with the port up to the left-hand side now, but ball over the top doesn't count as going long, does it? No, but I'm not the way here to play it, not because it'll be from inside the opponent's heart. Just every now and again someone makes a run that may be fair in Torres, sometimes it's almost, but they're taking turns to make a little zippy run, just needing one of them right. Spain in possession, out to the left-hand side they go, and Jordi Alba, Tani Alba may have made the run, but Alba got some field instead, towards a sense he owns, very well dispossessed by Sophie and Amrabat, all the way back to Bono, who clears long over halfway line, looking for, in the series, the tall Moroccan centre forward. It's cleared away by Spain, in the series who did score. Coming off the bench the last time these sides met at the World Cup in 2018, that finishes a two-wheel draw very late, equaliser for Spain, and the wals around the stadium, because Spain have conceded a free kick, just outside their own penalty area, good driving run by Sofiane Bufal. Spain aren't happy with the decision, but Rocco with a set piece in a very good position here. Eh, I think Spain should have got free kick before it. B, 100% convinced her to have fell on the first, but I think he's fallen down, he's slacked already. However, they've got a free kick, it's about 30 yards out, and they're very fortunate to get it, but if they score here, the Spain's scores will be furious for the referee. Yeah, Pat's called it, very, very soft indeed. They were furious at the award, and as Pat rightly points out, they will be even more furious if they end up conceding from this set piece. So, Rocco, the two players over this, one of them is Astraf Hakimi, the other is Hakim Ziesh. Spain, with the players in the light blue shirts, lined up just inside their own penalty area, 0-0 here, 11 minutes gone, will be Hakimi, and it's just over the bar. I think Simon have it covered, you know, good power in it, it's a good distance out, but with that sort of wall, there was four in the wall, it's going to have to be absolutely perfect. Noticeable, the Spanish do not play a player line during the carpet at the back, so I think they all have noticed that, Rocco, I think Ziesh will have noticed it, the entire wall jumped, and there was a gap underneath, so if they get another free kick. Yeah, good spot pattern, no draft excluder. Spain come down the left-hand side, ball into the penalty area, it's over the head of Asensio, by the head of Roman Ziesh, and up towards halfway, go Rocco, but Biscuits gets the foot in, and Spain will work it out to the left-hand side with Giuliava, his ball in towards Staniomo is too short, and Rocco again with the interception, all the way back to Bono, who's close down inside his own penalty area, taking a bit of a chance there, and he's it out in the end, very calm, he's a Saiz, it's one of those that, if that works out, then brilliantly, calmly done by Rocco, as Maserari wins the throw as well, but if it doesn't, we're all looking at the goalkeeper saying, what on earth are you doing? It is a sweet thing, if it does work out, but what a chance he takes there, that's extraordinary, with the Spanish players around him, and he's trying little tricks and dummies, and he's on little sex yardling, not intelligent to do that, you know, it's suggested. Free kick to Rocco, it's swung over to the right-hand side by Sofiane Bufels, yes, she wins the head of it, sends it back into the Morocco half, looking for a red shirt, it's collected by Amrabat, he goes down and wins the free kick, as Bono watches on inside his own penalty area, he's had a bit of a mixed tournament so far, Bono, he's the number one for Sevilla, so another one that plays his club football in Spain, so they two starts here, pulled out just before kick-off against Belgium, because he wasn't feeling well, had a really good match against Croatia in the nil-nil draw, but some nervy moments against Canada, and there were shades of that, as he played the ball out of his own penalty area a couple of moments ago, Morocco in position, just inside the Morocco half, and it's out to the right-hand side, and yes, they work it all the way back to just outside their own penalty area, and a get of West Ham. Well, nearly got to 15 minutes without, there wasn't a go, too many chances in the Moroccans, and you can see there's a little adaptation, a little change in the style of the game now, beforehand they were sitting in those banks that you perfectly described, and just allowing the possession for the Spanish, it's not happening now, look, they've opened the game up now, and they've widened the game up, as if to say, okay, we're here now, we're going to play. They're in possession over on the far side, one element of Morocco that hasn't led up at all, the fans behind the goal away to our right, banging the drums, waving the flags, they believe, as Masrari comes down the left-hand side, down to the bar line, digs the ball across, and Seymour takes that very well, on the edge of his six-yard box, under pressure too. Yeah, I mean, and good understanding, doing the left-hand side, they've looked very good from the start, it's not a good ball in the sedution, Masrari, we can do much better than that, but Hamon Bifal, they look at this, they've got a very, very good understanding, they're both really good players, but sometimes you can have that, and they don't work together, they want to work together, and I always like to go back and win wingers' partnerships, but very good sometimes. Spain in possession, just inside the run-off, what was your favourite one then, Pat? Well, I saw the Scottish manager, Steibie Clark wasn't bad to work with, but there have been many before I offend anyone. Hello, Seibik, are you listening? Spain in possession, just inside their own half. Nil Nil, 15 minutes gone on five live BBC sounds and a cross-apricot on the BBC World Service. Morocco in the last 16, for the second time in their history, the first time for 36 years, they have never got further than this stage, but then Nil Nil is Spain after what has been an outstanding world cup for Wali's Regragris side. And the Spain in possession just inside the Morocco half just passing along that back four. Again, it's remarkable to think that. He's only been in charge since the end of August. And to get by, and that's not easy, but sometimes it's a simple thing that you can win it by bringing our favourite player back come to his much love, then he's done that with Z. Spain building down the left-hand side, depending on who's there now to do and does manage to do it. Anu Nahi between them, throw goes out and goes Spain's way. Goal is here, that education city staying in the Spain, knocking back into the centre circle and the rotary of Manchester City now worked out to the former City Man Ferran Torres, whips the ball to the edge of the area, it's cleared away by Morocco and they'll control as well and play it back to Sophie and Amra. But again, they're happy to play around in the road penalty area in Morocco. That's a little bit more safety first. Still very good distribution from Borne, but Altsi Masrari, the left back, Zaheese then lifting it forward, a little too casual there ahead of Masrari and picked up by Yerente, Amra back with the foot in, Spain picking up once more, Ferran Torres then goes down, he wants the free kick, the assistant right next to him says no. It's a Morocco phone, no, no. Yep, I'm absolutely amazed that the keeper wants to play it out from there. Sometimes it's on, sometimes it's not. Looking at it, they've got a little bit of physicality up around as well, they could maybe use that a wee bit more, but he wants to play it out for the back and do you know what, he's got a way with it so far. As you've said, there's been a few hairy moments in this tournament so far. My heart's in my mouth for him. Every time he does it, back there. By the way, a lot of words about the Spanish supporters, they are massively outnumbered, but they've kept on singing as well, so well done. Yep, good atmosphere, the chees and whistles though are coming from the Moroccan fans with Spain in position. Now it's won back by Amra Bats, who again plays it back to Zaheese under a bit of pressure, they go all the way back to Borne, what's he going to do here? Again he delays, again he lifts it out to Maserari on the left-hand side. Spain know that that is what's going to happen and they put the pressure on there with Ferran Torres and they've won the throw. I think you're right, Pat, it's one of those where you're watching it from up here, behind the stands, I'm with you. My heart is in my mouth every time that happens and also because he's playing it out exactly the same way, all they need to do is get in front of Maserari and suddenly they're in. I'd be surprised if they don't actually catch me at one point, but he actually looks really calm, he looks really comfortable and confident, which kind of tells me he can play a bit, so you know, fair enough, if he not gets away, but if it works, if it works for him, you know, you should keep on doing it, but there are certain go-kippers who want to do that all the time and others. And you know that he wants to get involved in the play, do you know there are keepers like that? You're desperate to go, I'd love to be playing deep man field. He's just throwing a good ball out. His controller balls from Bairney's boot to a field-batch who have missed control a couple of times already. Spain have taken the throw quickly, swung in by Torres, flashes past all the blue shirts inside the penalty area and cleared away by the red shirts of Morocco. Hakimi up towards Zee Esh, no nonsense from La Porte who clears forward, Olmow will pick it up, then Piel for handball there, but the whistle's already gone for a Morocco free kick. And Morocco in possession once more. I think they'd be delighted with it, Morocco. Absolutely delighted, because it looks, you know, for ten minutes as if they're having to get a kick at the ball. But it's a real belief about them, isn't it? Here's the keeper again. He's lumped at this time, well done, probably sensible. Yep, up towards halfway, looking for Sofiam Boufal. Spain will win it back, Foutin, though, in the centre of the park, almost gets it back from Morocco, from Anahi, but Spain will steal the ball back themselves. And then with Pedri going down in the free kick on halfway. Portugal against Switzerland, the final last 16 match coming up for you on five live this evening. Seven o'clock kickoff UK time, Alistair Bruseboul, and Rob Green will be your team for that one here. On five live BBC Sounds in across Africa on the BBC World Service, 19 and a half minutes played. Here's Morocco, Nile, Spain, Nile, Spain play it forward, straight into Anahi. Lovely skill down the left by Sofiam Boufal. Again, goes for the switch of play, looking for Hakim Zes, it's well read by Jordi Alba, almost then just got a little push in the back by Ashraf Hakimi, but the referee is happy to let that go. Morocco can come down the right-hand side, nice play by Zes. Hakimi will pick it up over on the far side, Alba's there with him, So Hakimi just stops and checks and tries to swing it into the area, does manage to get it in, La Porte is there underneath it, heads it up towards halfway, header one in turn by Aguierre of Morocco, and then, I'm about going down and winning the free kick. Again, more and more I rate the Spanish players. They felt that was just a perfectly normal challenge, you know. He pulled the head to head, now I've had a look at it here a second time, do you know what, referee's got that one spot on. Little nudge in the back there, I think it was Gabi, he made sure that he couldn't get the ball, and of course, on the right-hand side with his left foot is Amman Zes, and we all know he can deliver on his sixpence when he is on form. So Hakimi's Zes of Chelsea, an option. Hakimi's over there as well, but it will be Zes, good delivery, it's headed away on the edge of the area, important header, because Salim Amalal was racing into the area, and had that not been cut out, he would have been in for an effort on goal, but it is still 0-0 midway through the first half, as the ball is all the way back with Bono, the Morocco number one. Play is it out to again, and now Sofian Amrabat approaching the halfway line, options over on the left-hand side, so he uses Sofian Bouffal, a lovely skill from Bouffal. One way, then the other, he goes against Llorente, ball into the area, and it's flicked on, Spain just about gets something on it, picked up by Zes, right-hand side of the box, Q defending by Dani Almo back there, who blocks the cross-in as well, and the ball goes out for a Morocco throw, but that's excellent defending by Olmo against Zes. Yeah, he defended well, but Llorente, any feel-back who's done me that much, I mean, it's a classic by the ticket to get back in again. He felt for that, like the worst, almost as bad as famous, you know, Yuan Kruyff many years ago did, but it was a definite take on Dani, Llorente just looked completely at the place, and Bouffal got great left from that. Yeah, he started brightly, the former Southampton man, Morocco picking up on the right-hand side, currently playing his trade with Anjaye, bottom of Ligue 1 at the moment, and another, he returned from injury shortly before the World Cup, it hits those tails that are always so intriguing, isn't it, Pat? You know, Morocco having an absolutely brilliant tournament in the last 16, the second time in their history, the first time for 36 years, and yet several of these players were a couple of weeks away from not being able to be involved as the ball is cleared out by Spain Morocco throw, and they're really growing into this match. Yeah, I mean, as they say, that first 10 minutes, you're not so sure, but slowly they've just got into it very great by defending by Le Porte, he had to get over quite, so back was caught a possession, and they're just little signs now of concern, I would suggest, for the Spanish. You know, they're not being overplayed, but there are signs of concern. Spain in possession, they played out to the right-hand side, and Marcus Llorente, big call by Luis Enrique, who is in hot reverse to making a big call or two, to start Llorente ahead of, has been a quitter, and Carvajal is world-cut debut, just offering a bit more pace down that right-hand side to deal with the pace of Sofie and Bufal, but at the moment Bufal is very much getting the better of him, he's just stolen the ball from Llorente, he's still appealing for the free kick, as Bufal brings it centrally, Morocco have it on the halfway line, Bufal has gone down and stayed down, and the referee has stopped play, so Zee Esch has to stop over on that far side. Nice. You know, first of all Llorente's having a difficult time, but I do think he looks as if he was kicked down, and the referee's, you don't often say about him though, if he's hanging in any particular direction, he's certainly helping Morocco, he's a wee bit more than he's helping the Spanish just now, he's getting a little bit of a loop, and I haven't got a horse in this race, but even me, I'm thinking, this is the referee who's been swayed slightly by the crowd at the moment, and I think, by the way, well with a little stop and play there, Juliette just showed me there, right in front of the supporters, there's a guy with his back to him, he's wearing green trousers, and he is orchestrating every single move, and every single song, so we're hearing it here, and we know we've seen that in the past, this guy's good, he knows and they react to every single thing that he does, on both sides of the ground. What I love as well as Morocco clear the ball away from the back is that every now and then, he's checking over his shoulder just to see what's going on, because as a fan, that's taking one for the team, he's facing the fans, the Spain play the ball into the penalty area, his ball back, and it's off the bar, the flag goes up, brilliant, blocked by Anrabat as well back there, the offside flag went up, Ferran Torres did look offside as the ball was played in, but what defending that is from Anrabat, he didn't know that, he blocks it, Spain really should have put the first half in a way that hit the bar, it would have been ruled out for offside, but it's one of those where, again, Bono's got something on it, as the ball was driven in by Gavi. But it was a great save, wasn't it? Bono gets an arm on it, then it goes up to the crossbar, it's a strange save, but it's a good save, and you're right, the defenders up there, very quick, they can't tell, I mean, they suspected it was offside, but that's exactly the right way to do it, keep on playing until the whistle, it was five yards offside by the real, it was a stick on, but, you know, they kept going. Yep, players keep going, commentators keep going, that's what we have to do, and you never know, we've seen a couple, haven't we Pat, where we thought, oh, that's clearly offside, it's Cameroon going, wasn't it, again, a free-b-car, and in the end it was spot on now, Flagstay down for now with Asensio into the penalty area, side-knitting, Torres was arriving in the centre, and the flag continued to stay down, VAR would have had a look, but that was a big chance for Spain. Do you know about five minutes in, I said, I can see a weakness, that's it, that is exactly it, and you know that it's going to happen at some point, because if you leave that amount of space behind, the moment you do not close down the midfielder, you don't have to be that great, you can flick it in, that's our position, it doesn't get on target, you should do slightly better than that. And having seen the replay, he was onside, I'm not surprised, as I said, five minutes in the game, I can see where the problem is, where the weakness is, in the Spanish players, they can clearly see that, and they've got to get real quality in there, but you have to get good possession in the midfield before you can do that. Asensio goes down, wins the free-kick on the edge of the centre circle, 0-0, 26 minutes played in this last 16-type, you're on five live BBC sounds, and a cross-African. On the BBC World Service, here is Rodri in possession, closed down by Amala, but Spain work it out to the left-hand side. Now in field once more to Rodri, Llorente plays it forward, exchanges passes with Gavi, he has toppled more records for Spain at this World Cup, their youngest World Cup goal scorer, their youngest World Cup appearance maker, still just 18 years of age, the Barcelona man as the ball goes out to the left-hand side, Spain have it once more, 0-0, Rodri comes over the halfway line, and the whistles and the cheers start up again, and the man in the green trousers is checking over his shoulder to see what Spain are doing, he's waving his arms, the drum being beaten, the red and white drum right in front of him, he's good at keeping time, isn't he, whilst also good at multitasking, I think we can say, is Spain have it on the halfway line? I'm worried about him, see if he loses his foot now, he'll be out for the next game. Spain have the ball over on the far side, goal is him, Morocco looking to reach the quarter-finals for the first time in their history, so the port has it, and now Morocco going back into those banks to try and get Spain to have to play through them as the ball is into the penalty area, takes the deflection and leaves up for Bono. The thing about that run, we were talking about where they've got a weakness, the problem is Spain haven't got an absolute natural to make that run, there are certain players who, you're living in that sort of position, they love to get from just the eight of the ten and get behind, they've got eights and tens and players that have, but they generally want to stay with the ball, and hold the ball and not make those runs constantly beyond, so it's up to Ferranter, it's up to Almor, to continue doing it for the one that finally pays off. Ball out to the right-hand side by Amra Bac, to Ziesh, she will pull it back to Hakimi, and we're all the way back with Aguierd, and we're all the way back with Bono, the Morocco keeper. He sends it up to the halfway line, looking to get over the head of Llorente, he chests it down, but again, Bufal anticipates, wins the ball, Llorente trips him, that is not going too well at Spain at right back so far. He just doesn't look natural out there, I mean he can play so many positions, can he, Llorente? But, you know, often if you put a centre-back in a midfield, it's a very special position for a back, it's seriously specialist. You know, in my career, a centre-back came out to Mark, a right-back, a left-back, I'm thinking partying, and he does look as if he's not as comfortable as others. Morocco intercepts the ball, Sais plays it forward to the edge of the area, very, very calmly done by Rodri, steers it all the way back to Unise Seamon. They're trying to out-cool each other, aren't they, these defenders? I can't believe he tried to play that long, so he didn't try to. He actually played that back to his goalkeeper there, the pressure was under, he was getting chased down. Now in this area, he's a goal scorer, he can score, he will chase. It was millimetres, but he looked comfortable, didn't he? He did, Le Vorte on the ball over the half-way line, we know he's usually midfield, he has fielded in for Manchester City at centre-half as well, but that was a midfielders' ball back. He's in centre-half's position to the goalkeeper, and he did it very well as Rodri picks up the ball on the edge of the centre-circle, as the noise rises once more inside Education City. The Morocco fans believe that their team can make history this evening. The most important day in our footballing history, that's what manager Walid Regragi has called it, Spain in possession, just inside the Morocco half, 0-0 on five-life BBC sounds in across Africa on the BBC World Service. He talked about bringing popular players like Ziersh back. Regragi himself such a popular player when it comes to Morocco's history, it was part of the side that reached the Africa Cup Nations final back in 2004, as Bono clears away from Morocco up towards half-way, and had impressed so much domestically too, as Manali wins a free-kick on half-way. Sorry, Camovie Vicky, Gavi just get taken out in the back there, referee gives nothing, the ball comes up seconds later, immediately going to give a free-kick to Morocco. Now, it's actually quite stunning, and it's now becoming quite noticeable that the Spanish players are getting really infuriated by it. Now, Luis Enrique as well as Morocco, playing up towards the edge of the penalty area, pulled back to the left back, Masraoui, and now here is Sofie Ambufeu, getting a lot of joy against Llorente down the left-hand side from Morocco. The ball in was poor though, but Morocco have won it back. Here is Bufal once more, and they're doubling up on him now. And that shows you what a torrid time he is giving Llorente. Gavi, it was coming over to help out. So Morocco say, all right, we'll go down the right-hand side, because we've got Chelsea's Hakim Ziersh over there, and here he goes, trying to work his way down to the bar line, but Jordi Alba gets a foot in, Morocco throw nil-nil. Yeah, and when he goes from left to right, you know they'll get great skill there. And he's actually a different player when he's wearing a Moroccan shirt. You know, he looks more live and more up to it, the upper it. He basically, he is a central player for them, so I'll carry on in a minute. Very good defending by Masraoui in the shot, Drivenini saved by Unais Simon. Morocco have their tails up, nil-nil. Well, you can see him wind them that one up for about four seconds, can you? He's going to have a hat here. It's a long way out, it went through bodies, it's one of those ones. Hanagot, a little bit of deflection, and by the way, it did touch the shirt of Rodri, didn't it? Hanagot deflection, I don't think he can save that. Ball forward by Spain is a good one, and since he just can't take it in his stride, if he had done, he would have been in, it's all the way through with Bono, it's nil-nil. That ball again, it's exactly the same ball, and I'm noticing it's happened time and again, just now and again, it's on. And the thing is, if you keep on playing the way that Morocco are playing just now, you know, there's a lot more of the balls being passed by the Spanish, they're getting a lot more in position, but it gets harder to cut that, it gets harder to close down the midfield, because as soon as you let, you know, this gets to the player, Pedru special, Gaby special, if you give them any space at all, and their head gets up and there's a gap behind, they will find it, they absolutely will find it. Here comes Rodri for Spain, stops and checks, on the edge of the centre circle, forward to Pedru, brilliant ball through to Ferran Torres, down to the bar line, digs it in from the right-hand side, Akimis there, wins the header, comes out to Dani Olmo, that's brilliant defending by Zs, just stole back and took it off almost, toes inside the penalty area, Spain having once more, but it's broken down, and now Morocco can try and counter, down the left-hand side, they go, Boufal tries the cross with Paul again, it's really poor, it bounces all the way through to Unicez, all in bright yellow inside the Spain penalty area. I'm just looking at that back lane now, they're asking the question, they're turning over the manager, do you want it this high, are you sure you want it this high, both centre-halves have turned around the manager, and he said, yeah, that's what I want you, keep doing it, it's a tight one, and it's a lane, but it's a high wire lane. Here is Jordi Alba, lovely turn by Gaby, down to the left-hand side of the penalty area, plays the ball across, will come all the way through to the other side of the box with Ferran Torres, down to the bar line, couple of twists and turns, still has it Torres, despite the challenge coming in, and Rotary has it now, and they're really pushing up now, the light blue shirts of Spain, out to the left-hand side, they go once more, Hakimi with the foot in, so Spain go back again to Le Port, the Morocco fans whistling and cheering, and trying to put Spain off their stride, but they're getting into their stride now, Spain, as they play it forward, little one-two on the edge of the penalty area, out to the right-hand side, and Ferran Torres, the red shirts are back in numbers for Morocco, Pedri has it, just outside the box, plays it back once more to Le Port, 30 yards out, slides it through, Olmo, lovely control, tried to chip it out once again, headed away by Morocco, and then, Reinaji is caught on the edge of the area, he cleared it up towards halfway anyway, and Morocco will have a free kick, but that was more like it from Spain. Whoa, the Moroccan needed that breather, didn't he? They knew they were in real trouble there, it is a free kick, and that's... You know, if you get that amount of space, you slow down, if you get that close down, you sink to yourself, right, my team are under serious, serious pressure here, give them a little bit of a break, because hands being kept on going for another minute or so, that you feel as if they were going to break through, long, deep breath now, for those Moroccan defenders, because they live dangerous like that. It's whether Spain can actually keep on doing it at that pace for the entire time, I don't think they can, that's the problem. Well, it's been ebb and flow, hasn't it, from Spain, and that's partly because Morocco have been pushing them back, but they've taken their time over that free kick, just as Pat says, to give themselves that little bit of a breather, and we're about almost getting a foot in, Spain will have it though, out to the right-hand side, and Llorente, who goes all the way back to Rodry, who touched it back to Simon, closed down by Enesiri, who hasn't had too much to work with the Tall Morocco striker, and Spain will bring it forward. You mentioned the slight brush of the shirt there that the ball had on Rodry a couple of minutes ago, talking about brushes of the shirt, that's why Roman Saïs has a goal so far in this World Cup, so Beery's free kick against Belgium, looked as though it had gone all the way in, took the slightest nick of Saïs's shirt, as Morocco won't keep it in on the far side. It's one of those where it doesn't even change the flight of the ball, but because here they have the sensors in the ball, they really can tell if it's brushed a player, if it's touched a player at all. So FIFA gave the goal to Saïs. Do you know what Saïs did? He said, give it to Beery, he deserves it. Now, who does that not remind you of? Um, yes. I saw a little gentleman who may be playing a wee bit later on tonight, that we can hear in Radio 5 Live. Completely coincidentally, Portugal against Switzerland is coming up, 7 o'clock UK time, Alice De Grisball, and Rob Green, your commentary team for that one, did you win us on 5 Live in BBC Sounds, here across Africa on the World Service as well. It's 0-0 between Morocco and Spain in this last 16 tie as the ball goes out of play from a Morocco throw, and Spain again are protesting this time for Antares, is chewing the assistant 0, but to no avail, and Morocco have this throw deep inside their own territory. What the Moroccans would love to get is that they could get before, or they could get the ace in the final clock. Now, high up the pitch, in an area where they've got one-on-one, they could get some sort of help to the centre forward. As you said just a moment ago, in the series, he's had very, very little to work on, and he's chased, and he's hurried, and he's using his physicality as much as he can. He's getting nothing out of Roger and La Porte at the moment. Well, he's actually come deep there, with Spain having it in the centre circle. He did win the header from the throw in the series, tried to flick it on towards Sophie Ambu Foul. But Spain, intercepted, and Morocco will do the same, and have it outside their own penalty area, 0-0. As Hakimi plays it out to that right-hand side, and Anahi ball over the top, Hakimi will chase, so won't keep it in just too much on it out for a Spain throw. You know, it's quite as Morocco, if you look at how they've played all the way through this tournament, you know, they suck up a bit of pressure, they're accepting they're not going to get a lot of the ball in certain situations, but they, I mean, they change speed of attack, and then the angle of the champ, so unexpectedly, because they do it so irregularly, and Anahi are feeling they're just holding on, wanting to get to maybe the last 20 minutes or so, and I think they can let loose a wee bit, but they want to wait at that amount of time. Dangerous play, a very dangerous play, but it feels like they can just hold on to this game, keep it at 0-0, and they've got very close to getting on the way half-time. After that, they can let loose. Spain coming down the left-hand side, they've ball into the penalty area, pleaded away by Masrari, it was another good delivery down the left, but no light blue shirt in the right place to receive it from Gavi, and now Morocco can come forward out to the left-hand side, we've found we'll just about get there, Dink sits through three blue shirts, back towards his own goal, but Amrabat sends the ball forwards with no real purpose, and Spain will pick up possession midway through their own half. Remind you, you can listen to all the debate, reaction and analysis on the World Cup Daily podcast, download that every day from BBC Sounds, and the Sports Desk podcast is your place to go if you want a wider look at the issues around this World Cup tournament. All out to the left-hand side, here goes Spain over the halfway line, we'll scoop the ball across to Rodri, just inside the centre-circle, plays it forward now to Pedri, the run had been made through the centre, but Pedri didn't quite release Marco Asensio in time, so they're working out to the left-hand side once more, Jordi Alba looking for the run of Dani Alma, that's very well defended over there. I mean, this is it, isn't it? Morocco, individually, so many players are having brilliant tournaments, but to get to this stage, to the last 16, for the first time in 36 years, they needed their biggest players to step up, ZH has been brilliant, and Ashraf Hakimi has been brilliant. Yeah, and I suppose the way the team's set up has been brilliant as well, but Hakimi actually right out of the stand there, looked a little bit nervous for me, but he's actually grown into the game, and he's got an amazing pace when he breaks, on that right-hand side. I talked to the link-up, the left-field back, and the left-winger, the same in the right, it's not been working quite as well, but don't write it off in this game yet, absolutely don't write it off. Ball over the top from Bono, Chester Danwell by Bufal, who was caught, says the referee by Gavi, who ran away wagging his finger, well switched on there from Spain, because Morocco thought about taking that free quickly with Amraba, despite Bufal still being down, but it's another one-pack where Spain feeling that they've not got the rubber degree. It doesn't matter, actually. In this game, you have to just accept it, you have to put it off with it. If you walk about more than all the time, and you lose your concentration in your play, which fortunately they didn't there, then it can have a negative effect, and it can have that negative effect in how you're playing, so the Spanish feel upset about it, but they have to put it to the back of Amraba. They did lose their concentration, but Gavi is still complaining, he's as good as multitasking as our friend in the green trousers over there, still orchestrating the Morocco fans, who have now got their phones out and are waving at the other end of the ground as their team attack down this left-hand side, ball into the penalty area, cleared away poorly, will come back into the penalty area from the right-hand side, well headed away by Biscuits, picked up by Bufail, who digs it back in once more, and the header is over from the edge of the six-yard box, and what a chance that was for Morocco and West Hamza again. Yeah, again, it's got into a brilliant area. I would argue that's the best chance of the game. I would say definitely the best chance of the game. They get into a good position, not a good clearance in the first place, goes to the right-hand side, put to the back post. The skills of Bufail are absolutely fantastic. Anyway, they get the ball in, I guess it's got to do better, hasn't it? Got to get that on target. It's a header, back post, it's unchallenged, it's not about seven yards out, got to get it on target. Well, he has scored once for Morocco, but that was a huge opportunity to break the deadlock, but two and a half minutes until half-time, a size clears away under pressure. It's still Morocco, Niel, Spain, Niel, good hold-up play by Enna Sirius. Morocco spread it out to the left-hand side and Bufail wants more, urged forward. Has Maserawi on the overlap, here he is, the left back plays the ball into the area, Seymour watches, it's met at the far post, just about cleared away by Spain, once again inside their own six-yard box. All that almost sat up so nicely for Morocco. It's had a play on half-way for a Morocco throw and listened to Education City. Do you know what? Is they don't write off those understandings between the throwbacks and the wingers there. I mean, it's what they all just want in the game, but they have an amazing understanding. I think Bufail is giving the ball away once or twice in this game, but I'm looking at him thinking, it doesn't matter, mate, you've got to get on the ball because you're opening up that defence now in a game. You get a great understanding of your throwback, Maserawi, who's running constantly behind you and beyond you. He's overlapped and he's underlapping as well. They might do it too often, but when they do, it isn't bothering them, they're dead. Here comes Spain, though, central position in field now to Rodgerie in the centre circle. 0-0 on five-high BBC sounds and across Africa on the BBC World Service. Here is Llorente, plays it in field once more to La Porte in Spain. We'll just slow things down, and they often do, but I wonder whether this is also slightly a defensive ploy because Morocco have just fashioned a couple of very good chances in the last five minutes. They just impress you the way Morocco, they don't have a lot of the ball, they defend well. Here comes Ferran Torres, though, down the right-hand side, Ball in, looking for a sensio, almost managed to latch onto it. It's well defended at the back by Aguierre, who's missed that chance at the other end. He has fulfilled his defensive duties there, it's the Spain corner. Yep, well done, Spain, turning out the pressure. Taking short, Morocco need to stay switched on, as the ball is swung in right-fitted by Pedri, it's a poor cross, and it's all the way out of play for a Morocco goal kick. 0-0. That actually summed up one of the problems with Spain. That was a brilliant ball, into a great area, and there were five Moroccans ushering it out, and there was not one Spaniard attacking the ball. I mean, there's a wide player, you're delighted with that ball. It's between the centre-backs and the goalkeeper, it's zapping with a better goal, but no, not one blue shot, a sky blue shot, attacked that ball, and that's a problem. One minute about a time, at the end of an absorbing, pulsating first half, particularly for Morocco, who will be absolutely delighted with how this has gone, other than perhaps that Aguierre didn't stick that header away a few moments ago, as Bono sends the ball for Morocco. Over the halfway line, the header is won well by Rodgerie, but Morocco will pick it up once more with O'Naghi. Pays it back to the left back, Maserawi, Luis Enrique down there on the touchline, waving his arms. Morocco will be very happy. I don't think Spain will be all that pleased with this first half. They have put together some nice moves, and might do so here. Suddenly it's almost four on three, the Red Shirts getting back. Ammo leaves it, and it's cleared away by Maserawi on the penalty spot. Fine margins, fine, fine margins as the whistle goes for halftime, and Pat that pretty much sums it up for Spain, almost brilliant, but the final ball not quite there, and in truth we haven't seen enough of those moves in this first half. I think on balance, although Spain looked really dangerous in those positions, Morocco have been the better side. In some ways, yeah, I mean, they've got a lot more of possession. If you look at the passing stats, I haven't seen them yet for a while, but they must be passing much, much more than the Moroccans have done. However, the Moroccans have a game plan. The game plan is to defend in a very specific way. It's organised constantly the same way, so it works well. They've only lost one goal in this tournament so far, but boy did they break quickly. And that is a danger, you're right. So a big 45 minutes to come, as Morocco look to reach the quarterfinals for the first time in their history. Spain, the 2010 winners looking to avoid, well, could we even call it an upset? I think we still could, they are still favourites, but Morocco certainly justifying why many people back them to pose real problems for Spain in this tie. Half-time in Education City, it's goalless. Not exactly chance-laden, is it, Pat? I sort of think in many ways the best thing about that first half is the Spanish kit. Well, the Man City kit, which clearly looks like it is just now. I think Pep Guardiola's having an effect here. In all honesty, if there wasn't a phenomenal atmosphere in here, it would be a pretty average game. But it's a game of chess, and I understand what they're doing. And sometimes you get games like the walk-up, they're not always going to be flying here and there, there's not always going to be silky football from the Brazilians. You're going to have ones that are a technical battle, and this is a good high-level technical battle. You know where the weaknesses are. GM was kind enough to tell us beforehand, and he's right. He's absolutely right where the problems are. You can see where the one or two little weaknesses are, where the Moroccans are just about holding on, but there's enough of a story there that they're thinking, hold on to this, technically live slightly by your fingernails, by the first half. But the second half, then change it, then manipulate it, and then make sure you've got the wingers and the fillbacks flying. Because at the moment, if there's one person I want to see on the ball just now, it's Buffal. I'm loving him on the ball. And he gives away none again, but that dummy. You're going to talk about it, aren't you? Well, we are, because as Sebastian Bassop in the studio would be said to be, unfortunately for Laurenti, that's going to be all over YouTube now, forever. Forever, as he said to it for a hot dog. Yeah, it's going to be on YouTube, Instagrammeries and everything. Because the dummy was amazing, but that was a bit of a challenge defending from Laurenti, but I don't take no credit from Buffal. But in terms of this pain, yeah, it's the game is a chess game. Morocco is tactically in place, they're eating on counterattack, and they really make a good use of Buffal and Akim Zeyeshev. I don't know why, but it's going to take a lot from the Spanish touch to break them down. They've almost done it, but it has to be perfect for them to get a goal. You can understand the Moroccan high line and the risk and reward, because it's not that often they get in behind. It's not that often, and if I was a Moroccan player or manager, I would have adopted this tactic, this shape, because that plays in their favour. They know they're not going to have most of the ball, they rather give the ball to Spain and hit them where it hurts. And I think Spain with the time, they've got to be really patient, but they've got to really be careful, because one or twice they've been kind of exposed, and if Moroccans are more efficient going forward, I think they can really hurt Spain. Kian Balagay with us as well, it has panned out as you said it would so far. Yes, and I've just heard of a stat that's an interesting stat, the biggest amount of Cops of T being prepared in the first half of a game in this world cup. You go and nothing happens, Cops back in, still the same kind of stuff. This is the story, I think, as you've been describing of a team waiting for the little gap of a space to be created, and another one just waiting for the mistake. But I feel there's been a tiny little change of dynamics, because it feels like all of a sudden, Morocco starts to feel, how about if we go forward a bit? So they go into the changing room with that question mark left in the air. Will they try to capitalise that, the fact that when they attack things happen? Meanwhile, it hasn't been enough high pace, high rhythm, enough movements for Spain to be dangerous. The only chance that one of us sensed it when he was running behind, that was it. So, yeah, I'm just going to make another look of the team. Well, just before you do, Pater Vicky mentioned it in commentary. Myself and Seb have talked about it here. Spain needs to keep their cool with the ref. It does appear noticeable that the decisions are going more Morocco's way than they are Spain's way. They need to not let that distract them, which is easier said than done. Yeah, they will be worried. All the team for Gabi, I think, who's the one who's most likely to lose it at some point. Everybody else, players that play for Manchester City or Barcelona, they would have been in these situations. It does feel a little bit like every time a Morocco players' fold or a referee falls for it. But in any case, yeah, that should be out of the head. It's about concentrating on moving the ball from side to side. I mean, Pat will tell me, but it did feel like the full backs, Alba on the left-hand side and on the right-hand side, they make a lot of wrongs that were not found. What's the point of making this style when they're supposed to do that and nobody feels brave enough to find that pass? So, it's all very, very predictable. I'll jump in and just say you're right because we'll be talking about, from the first five minutes, the obvious ball that is going to be the Moroccans is there. You can see what it is. They're about 25 yards, 20 yards outside the 18-yard line with the whole line. Javi needs to ask who I mentioned before, they would destroy that. They would just tell that, he said, because they would run across the line and they would give it intelligence to runs. The problem is they've not got quite that quality yet. They will keep on making the runs, I think Alba will keep on making the runs, Ormell will, Torres will. Whereas before, you always knew that ball would arrive. It's not quite that standard yet and that's the weakness, that's the problem with the Spanish at the moment. And just for Pat to finish, Sophie-Anne Bufal's numbers at halftime, 27 touches, 11 duels won, 5 take-horns completed, 3 tackles, 3 ball recoveries, 3 crosses attempted and one chance created. He's been the man of that first half. Second half on the way with Pat and Vicky, Sebastian Bassoni, Guillain Balaghea with us as well. Gold us at the break between Morocco and Spain. Here's Jill McKenzie. Labour's Shadow Health Secretary is worth treating. Well, Health Secretary Steve Barclay says his door is open to meet with unions ahead of the strikes. Unions representing rail workers have been urged by the government to not hold the country to ransom after new strikes over Christmas were announced. The RMT boss, Mick Lynch, said he regretted the disruption but blamed ministers for negotiations stalling. The Conservative peer, Baroness Mone, says she's taking a leave of absence from the House of Lords. She denies claims that she lobbied on behalf of a company called PPE Medpro, which won government contracts during the COVID pandemic. Her lawyers have previously said she had no role or function in the company. Nine children across the UK are now known to have died from an illness linked to the bacterial infection, Strep A. The latest victim is a five-year-old from Belfast called Stella Lily Mukhawkendale. Our island correspondent is Chris Page. She was a pupil at Black Mountain Primary School in West Belfast, just a couple of miles from where I am now and the school has paid tribute to her on social media saying she was a bright and talented little girl, very popular and she will be much missed. And a man in his 20s has been arrested on suspicion of common assault after an egg was allegedly thrown in the direction of King Charles. Bedfordshire Police say the suspect is being questioned after the incident outside Luton Town Hall. The latest travel and the M4 in South Wales, so heading west towards Cardiff to Junction 29 at the A48M with the interchange of vehicle overturned, recoveries underway. There are two lanes closed at the scene and the queues go back to Junction 26 at Malpus Road. The M62 in Manchester west bound queues near the Eccles interchange at Junction 12, a vehicle caught fire. There are two lanes still closed at the scene and it's taking about half an hour. A1M in North Yorkshire, northbound queues heading towards the M1 from 42 at Selby Fork. That's a broken down vehicle in one of the lanes. Slow in Oxfordshire, the M40 Southbound at 10 at Brackley, that's a lorry which overturned at the roundabout at the end of the slip road, the exit slip. And also problems on the trains, it's because of the warehouse fire at Wolverhampton so you'll find one of the roads closed as well which is the A454 Wollinall Road, still closed in Wolverhampton in both directions and then it's affecting the trains as well so everything passing through Wolverhampton and Birmingham stations. One of that should be five live travel. Expert analysis and debate with some of the biggest names in football on the World Cup Daily podcast. What Gareth Southgate wants is that they can perform under the most intense pressure they will ever experience. And a bit of fun in match of the day top 10 with Gary Lenaker. Micah Richards is back along with Alan Shearer and myself for the biggest international football tournament on the planet. Take the World Cup with you. Listen on BBC Sounds. BBC Five Live. The FIFA World Cup. Qatar 2022 with Mark Chapman. Morocco nil Spain nil in the latest last 16 game here at the 2022 World Cup. Portugal against Switzerland from seven o'clock tonight here on Five Live and BBC Sounds highlights of both games on BBC One and the iPlayer from just after half 11. This evening a couple of head coaching bits of news for you. The main one being that just nine months before the men's rugby union, World Cup England have sacked head coach Eddie Jones. And the other one being that Michael O'Neill has reportedly agreed to deal to become the Northern Ireland manager for the second time. An official announcement is expected later this week. Now England's quarterfinal against France is of course on Five Live and BBC Sounds from seven o'clock this Saturday evening. All the talk during the tournament has been about Kylian Mbappe got two in their three won win over Poland. So he's the tournament's top scorer. Olivier Giroud became France's all-time leading male goal scorer in that game. But today even he couldn't avoid talking about his teammate. He's amazing and he's still young, which is scary because he still can improve his game. But he's very efficient, you know, and from the beginning of the competition, he's been crucial for us. He's obviously the best striker I play with and all the teams I play. But yeah, we still have not seen the best of Kylian. I hope it's going to come soon and it will beat all the records. So I know that, you know also. So I think he's unbelievable. Your thoughts on this current England team, are you surprised by how they've played here? So far they are the good tournaments. I hope they will have a tough game on Saturday. And I know very well this team and we were talking with Hugo regarding this game and we said, we don't want to lose against England. That's a special game for us, but yeah, they have quality but quantity also in the squad. So it will be a nice game to watch. I think interesting and I hope it's going to go well for us. Olivier Giroud there, but Sarah Menet, French football journalist, Kylian Mbappe has not trained today. Good afternoon Mark. Yes, we understand he was not part of collective training earlier in the afternoon, but no major concern. He took part in an indoor individual training in the gym. So no major concern for him. He has been complaining about a Nenco from time to time at the start of the World Cup. So nothing serious, but he's been complaining a little bit about his uncle. Pity the poor French press officer. When he or she found out there was going to be no Mbappe at training and realised what was about to come their way. What am I going to do? Oh my God, what do you do with that? Do you know what the mood is like within that French squad? Very good mood, we understand there's a very good mood, there's a very good team spirit. I think that's one of the strengths of DDA Digchamps management. The team, even the guys who are not playing, even the guys who know they will probably spend the rest of the competition on the bench, are taking parts into celebrations. I think everybody's living well together and they're obviously getting ready for Saturday's big game. The work started this morning because yesterday they had a bit of a break. DDA Digchamps for the first time in an international competition, offerised the players' families and the staff families to come and visit the players after the qualification against Poland. So they've seen their wives and their kids a little bit and work started this morning to get ready for that big clash against England on Saturday. Good stuff, Sarah. Thank you very much Camilla. Sarah Meneu, French football journalist. There will obviously be a lot of talk about England against France ahead of Saturday's quarterfinal, which you will hear with us here on Five Live. Second half about to get back underway at the Education City Stadium, back to Pat and Vicki. Perfect timing mark, we have just kicked off and it is Morocco in the red shirt, the dark green shorts, and the red socks that get us underway. The light blue shirts, the white shorts and the light blue socks. No changes made by either manager at half-time, Pat. So what are we expecting for this second half? What I'm expecting and what I'm hoping for, maybe we'll be able to do different things. If any team, either team could score a goal here, this game will completely change and we'll open up. It will become more end-to-end, but it's settled into a very odd pattern, where controlled by Manchester. Well, it's Roger in possession in a light blue shirt, isn't it? To the ports. And they're playing exactly like a pet Guardiola team. But it's exactly what it's like. But they need to change it slightly. If you're Spain, you need to change this slightly because you're actually falling into the trap of the Moroccans. I actually think you are. And the Moroccans will just, I think, get stronger and better as game goes on. So Spain haven't got out of their own half yet, having won back possession. They're passing it along that back four. We'll take you through the line-ups in a moment, but now they just go through the gear span. They've gone backwards again. So Bono in goal for Morocco. And the goal for Akemi. Aged, Saiz. And Masrawi. A Spain winner free kick just outside the Morocco penalty area. Nahi, Amrabat and Amala ahead of them. Ziesh, Boufal and Nasseri up front. Nice little bit of play there, but Ferran Torres. You've not seen enough of that yet. He stood up, he's defender, caught baston with a really nice little knockback. Then kept his run going. That's the question of Masrawi, which you haven't done that often in the game so far. So maybe Lewis and Ricky said, right, the change is, to you, Akemi, going to take a full-back for once. It's not happening the first half, it's now happening in the second. So a two-player Morocco wall. Bono has just told Amrabat. It looked like he was saying go join the wall, but Amrabat has taken up a position just on the edge of the penalty area. Spain knocked the free kick around between them, now goes into the area, headed away well by Nasseri, the tall striker back there for Morocco. And the ball goes out of play for Spain. Spain is Cimón in goal, the back four of Llorente, right back, Rodri, La Porte and Albert. Gavi, Bousquets, the only survivor of that 2010 World Cup win. And Pedri in the midfield with Torres, Almo and Asensio up front, as Uthrow goes all the way back to Rodri. Midway through the Morocco half, and now Spain will work it back to La Porte on the edge of the centre circle. That's the thing for Spain. The attacking powers that they have on the bench, if they need to change it, if it stays nil-nil, they've got the players to bring on and do that. You're reading my mind, aren't you? But I'm just looking and thinking, surely Marató has got to be a decision at some point because his score's goals, he's also a striker, it's a set of following. Again, almost from Spain, Almo into Asensio, the ball is cleared away for a Spain throw. And Morocco aren't very happy about that. They felt that Spain have got the final touch on that ball, but it is a throw for Spain. Jordi Alba will take it level with the penalty spot on the left-hand side. Nil-nil here on 5-Live, BBC Sounds, and across Africa on the World Service. As Almo is dispossessed, and Zee Esch now will pick it up down the right-hand side, and he's roared forward. Zee Esch cutting in field, played the ball forward just too much on it, intercepted at the back by La Porte and all the way back by Jordi Alba. Seamon then closed down under pressure inside his own area, does clear, but only as far as Amrabat, as they come forward once more, Morocco. Trying to trick his way into the penalty area is Amala, cleared away by Spain. And they win the free kick as well. Well, end to end there, Pat, for a moment. Yeah, for a moment. I mean, that's a lot more interesting. The ball that was brilliantly actually right to start from Zee Esch, she gets about 50-60 yards there, running with good pace, cut sensei, there's a ball right to Buffal. He doesn't play it. If he plays that ball, Buffal's got one-on-one, and he can attack the goalkeeper. So, from Morocco, they broke very well, broke very quickly, as they tend to last ballplayed, the session wasn't clear. Spain in possession on the halfway line. You know, now you've said Manchester City, I'm having to concentrate so hard, and not say that. But he's Spain into the penalty area. Ascensio, left-hand side, full start of the box, good defending by Morocco. Olmó will pick it up. Now all the way back with Jordi Alba as the whistle starts again. Here is Rodri, just stepping forward a little bit more from that centre half position. Pedri plays it to Llorente, out to the right-hand side, where Ferran Torres waits, and the flag eventually goes up. He was well challenged in the end, but the flag is up for offside. 0-0, five minutes gone in the second half. Yeah, much better actually. Well, it's a much better, a bit better. Certainly a bit better was in the first half. The good thing about Spain is actually they're moving it a little bit quicker through, you know, the zones that they feel with the forehand, it was far too slow, it was around the back line, it was giving the Moroccans plenty of time to get men behind the ball, but also get their structure right. At the moment, Spain are moving it a little bit quicker now. I suspect Luis Ramos has had a word with it. You know, if you keep on doing this, you'll end up at penalty kicks, and do they really want that? Bono takes this free kick from Morocco over the halfway line. They certainly won't want it, Spain, but I tell you what, those players are better be prepared, because Luis Enrique in the build-up to this saying that he'd given the Spanish players homework over a year ago at a Spain training camp. He wanted them to get here to the World Cup, having taken over at least a thousand penalties in practice at their clubs. So I hope he's got tallies of them, and everyone had to hand in the sheets of when they did it and where they did it, as Morocco concedes the free kick and it's Hakimi's turn to get frustrated with Gavi, rather than the other way around, Spain free kick. Yeah, I think penalties have been, well, they have been important already, and if you look to the first two particular penalty kicks on Japanese, the other night, I mean, absolutely awful, like I've got a cheat. That wasn't the best penalty kick taker, but there are certain players who just don't think I've switched it in the jab, and you can't look like it at all. Morocco clear the ball up towards half-way, the header is won by Rodri, and out to the right-hand side it goes. Back to Rodri once more, and now La Porte, Spain moving over the halfway line, trying to ease through the gears, but it's well intercepted by Zee Esch, and Morocco will bring the ball away. We have to say Zee Esch is Hakimi, thought he was pulled back there and eventually does get the free kick. He's forced the referee's hand there, hasn't he? And Luis Enrique is absolutely furious, because it was a real tussle for Hakimi, he's decided to stop and say, and he does have his arm, to be fair, but... So does Hakimi, he's one of those ones who gave the decision now. I don't think it was the referee who gave the decision, but once again, it's a durian, the Spanish players, but they just cannot let it get to him, they cannot let it affect him. Yeah, I think the Spain boss Luis Enrique increased with you as well, passed as the free kick is wasted by a Gehrz, outs over to the left-hand side, but straight out of play for a Spain throw. Do you notice like in games like this, you look at 55, 60 minutes and think, right, okay, think we make some changes, if it's not going your way, you know, either team can consider it, maybe more Spain, and we'd say maybe more Spain, I think they're the more likely to make the quicker substitutions, but with your mind on the fact that it could be 30 more minutes, and you want to keep your penalty kick takers on there, there's a lot to be taken into account before you make those decisions. Long way to go, Spain in possession on this left-hand side, eight minutes gone in this second half, Nil Nil on five-life BBC sounds in across Africa on the BBC World Service now, Hakimi has brought down Gavi there, just outside the penalty area, and he's on the left-hand side, he's protesting his innocence there, Hakimi. I wouldn't have given that, I still wouldn't give that. He's actually thrown his right leg into the defender, defenders try to get away, and he's thrown his leg forward. It's one of those ones, if you're a defender, you think, what can I do, I'm just running along? I think that's the point he's making. Yep, exactly that point to Sergio Brasquez, a Spain trier, cheeky one, and take the free kick quickly, but the referee isn't happy with that, I know I'm still organising the wall and having a conversation, so it will have to be a little bit more orthodox for Spain, who have Dani Olmo and Marco Asensio over this wide-left position, Nil Nil, nine minutes gone in the second half, all the red shirts that they're defending from Morocco, two-player wall, and the light blue shirts of Spain away, so it's laid off to Dani Olmo, who went for goal, and Bono gets two big fists behind it and punches it away. Well, we're far away, Pat, I think you can see the look of surprise from here from Bono, but he did stand up well to it, and that was a little bit of ingenuity from Spain there. Yep, much, much livelier, they've moved it a little bit quicker, unexpected, something else to be working in, and the training ground, but it was straight out the goalkeeper, and it's one of those ones, it looks like you've had your letter and you've hammered them. That's true, Asensio tries the little back heel, looking for the run of Ferran Torres, cleared away by Morocco, and the ball goes out of play for a throw, which Rodri will take. They have already held Croatia at this tournament. Morocco, they scored two late goals to beat Belgium, two clean sheets into the bargain. They won that group, beat in Canada in their final match, Spain finishing runners-up to Japan, but it's Spain in possession, and Spain, who 10 minutes gone in this second half, are just looking a little bit more in control now and a little bit more dangerous. Rodri finds the ports on the halfway line, who is Gavi, but this is what they do, Spain. There's a lull and a wave, and then a lull will come again, but now the blue wave is coming forward down the left-hand side, and Akimi, who had intercepted, has been dispossessed by Olmo. Akimi gets back in, Olmo goes down, no free kick given. Olmo doesn't really protest on the edge of the penalty area. He did have a look at the referee, who says no, and now Amrabat over the halfway line, and the flag goes up very quickly against Enesiri, and he did look offside there, and that's real frustration for Morocco, because that was the right ball, but Enesiri didn't hold his run, and that could have been a real chance. That is the game plan in a second, and it showed you they're breaking ground there. They're doing it again now. They're coming forward again down the left-hand side. Enesiri waits in the centre, challenge on the edge of the area, referee again, lets it go. This time it goes Spain's way, but foul going down. As was Masraoui, the left back. The two of them working it down that left-hand side. Might have been a handball in the end from Morocco too, and we play on Spain in possession with Jordi Alba. Goes in field to Biscuits, out to the right-hand side, and now Ferrantores under pressure, and under that pressure, won't keep it in, and it's a throw to Morocco, nil-nil. The way they're playing, it's like if it was... If the national team was on something from the Animal Kingdom, they'd be a cobra. They just sit there and sit there and they hold that, and then they strike with brilliant, brilliant pace, and they know what they're doing, they're just waiting. The more this is going on, the more I'm impressed. By then, yes, the Spanish have got more of the ball, but the way that they're breaking down, it's as if they're just growing and growing and growing into it. It's exactly what they've done against the Belgians. It's so brave to do that, to allow that much possession away, and it feels like they're going to get at least one or two chances before the end of this game in the Moroccans. Can they take them? Throw to Morocco on the far side as their manager, Walid Regragi, stands, arms folded in his black suits and white trainers on the edge of his technical area. They've advanced a few more yards with another throw. Still unbeaten under Regragi, as we mentioned earlier, he's only been in charge since the end of August. Six games, four wins, including against Belgium, two draws, including against Croatia. They are going from strength to strength in this tournament, and they once again are giving a very good account of themselves, Morocco, nil-nil with Spain. The Spain have it just outside their own penalty area. Pedri Spindbott down, so they'll have a free kick a few yards up now. Zee Esch, there's no need to do that there. Spain had bowled the ball up with Jordi Alba to where the free kick was going to be taken from, and Zee Esch just kicked it backwards, so referee's happy to let it go, and it all simmers down into nothing, but just can't let your concentration and your discipline waver. On a stage like this, where Morocco are looking to get to the quarterfinals for the first time in their history, it's so finely poised. Just don't give the referee an excuse. Yeah, to make me know that he's actually got that in his game. He's given away a free kick now again, but he's got away with it. Avanti's played as Almo comes forward, cleared away by Amrabat. Morocco aren't happy, they want a free kick, they have a player down, but the ball has gone out of play, and now the referee is just stopping play to make sure that nothing on towards has happened for Kimia Walsh, who was colliding with Gavi. Yeah, he's just run into him, actually, that's quite a short one. They're probably making a bounce, yesh. You know, silly to kick the ball away. He's made three or four tackles already, and he's given free kicks away. Do you know the next one? The referee's thinking, I'll help you. Don't do it, you're absolutely right. It's silly to do that with so much riding on it. Spain in possession, forward by Busquets, well, blocked away for Morocco, and will come right back to Spain, and the red shirts of Morocco would just drop and be jumping ever deeper with the light blue shirts of Spain creep forward. Jordi Albin out, turns into central position, plays the ball into the area, headed away by Roman Saiz, forward again by Busquets, but no danger there, no light blue shirts in the box, and it's all the way through with Bono, nil, nil. It's amazing how often when something happens, you immediately look down towards the bench and think, yeah, surely now, surely now. It's a good-out feeling about the Spanish. Surely now, you've got to consider what else you can do. Yep, it is 60 minutes now that another has gone. They've created minimal chances, very, very few chances, and they know they're actually in a lot of bad danger with the speed that the Moroccans are breaking at. This game is extraordinarily finely poised, and you should be controlling it if you're Spain, and I'm not sure they are. They're in possession just inside their own half. Moroccan friend in the green trousers takes a look over his left shoulder once more as he leads the Moroccan fans behind that goal away to our right. You have to say as well, he's bouncing up and down now. You're right, Paine. He just needs to be a little bit careful there on that wall, doesn't he? He's having a great time. Morocco have had a great time at this World Cup. It's nil nil with Spain very much in this armoroco, as the free kick is given to Spain, and the referee comes over very quickly. Really, the Moroccan substitutes and the manager, Walid Regragi, who were furious there, they've not quite come on the pitch, but half the subs jumped off the bench, and the referees come over to calm them down as much as anything else. Yeah, we didn't see them changing. They are changing now, Spanish. Slightly overdue in my mind. It's taken a wee while for them to do it. They need to add something else going forward. You can't be getting out of the World Cup here. You're just almost sleepwalking towards going out, so he's going to make a couple of changes in a minute. Thank you. They're waiting till this three kicks have been taken, the last chance for one or two players. And no surprise, Alvaro Morata is one of those changes coming on. Carlos Soler is the other, but Morata has only started one match at this World Cup, but has scored in every single World Cup match here. The only player to net four in a row for Spain at a World Cup, or across a World Cup is David Villar. Spain needs something. It's nil nil. They've taken the free kick short, knocked it around between them. Jordi Alvaro's ball into the area. A bit of a swing and a misclearance by Roman Saiz. Bono under pressure punches. Not a great one, but does squeeze its way out of the penalty area and might turn into a great break for Morocco. Perhaps a bit of fortune. Ziesh, play continues as Ziesh was caught there. Referee was happy to play the advantage and good decision in the end. And Nahi can't keep going down that right-hand side without a play from a Morocco throw. They're just about to make a change here, but they bear the careful. I'm trying to see who that is down there. There's an injury to one of the Spanish players. And if you're going to make two changes, then one of your players is going to come down with what may well be a hamstring injury. We shall see. Well, they have made the first change. Ascensios number is up, so he's coming off. And Gavi is being replaced by Carlos Soler. So, Morato on for a centre. They're not waiting, are they, Spain? I guess if he wants to make this tactical change anyway, Luis Enriquez, he's got three more substitutes that he can make. Remember your extra time, but yeah, there's a lot of substitution you make. That's absolutely fine. He certainly moved on a little bit. Ascensio was stunningly quiet tonight, wasn't he? Staggeringly quiet. Very, very little input into the game today. So, I don't think he could complain. And Moratas, come on. He's got a good focal point now that they can get the ball up to. But that little break there, just before the substitutions were made, that was another warning sign, wasn't it? And it has to be said, Luis Enriquez, Gavintu, he spotted the warning signs. He had to change. Well, Hakimi is getting a pat on the back of the head. It was Jordi Alba, who was down receiving treatment, but he's back up to his feet. He looks as though he will be able to continue. Luis Enriquez clutching a water bottle in his left hand. He's waving his right hand. Saying, come up, push up. Because Morocco are in possession, just outside their own penalty area, all the way back to Bronnow now, who clears left footed out to the left-hand side. And Sofian Boufal, the former Southampton man. Crossfield pass, down the right. He was looking for that run of Zesh. It's all the way through the United Seamond. For all, Boufal has done well in many areas, Pat. His distribution, those Crossfield passes, the vision's great. The execution hasn't quite been there. I don't know, there's big weaknesses in the game. I think his decision-making's been poor. Quite a few attains, but he will do something very, very skillful every now and again. To be honest, I don't think he's going to last much longer. I'm having a look up there, and he seems to be struggling a wee bit. Maybe a calf problem. So ball out to the left-hand side, where Dani Olmo picks it up for Spain. Nil-nil here on five-live BBC Sounds, and a cross-Africa on the BBC World Service. Ball out to the right-hand side, and Ferran Torres cleared away well at the back by Masrawi, and will be picked up by Spain on the half-way line. In field now to La Porte, who will square it to Pedri, Spain. Pick and choose where they want to send the passes. So comfortable, as we know in possession. They send it out to the right-hand side, Soler the substitute will find Ferran Torres, who picks the ball into the area, cleared away by Roman Saiz, and will come back out to Spain once more. Midway through the Morocco half, here is Emeric La Porte. All the red Morocco shirts back inside their own half as the ball into the area just had too much on it, and Masrawi can watch it behind. Decent run by Ferran Torres, but to no avail. Well, the least of it's something for now when they hit it into the box. I suspect the amount of games that these teams have had so close together, the tension involved, we will see a lot of substitutions now. And it's the first chance that Morocco has had to do that, not going to do that. And you are absolutely right about Sophie and Bufal. His game is done, and coming on is 20-year-old Abdei Ezzazouli. He's been in and out of the side for Osasuna this season, he's on loan from Barcelona. 20 years old, he's made a handful of appearances for Barcelona. And again, it's one that struggled with injury in the build-up to the World Cup. Born in Morocco, moved to Spain as a seven-year-old. So playing his club football against the Saiz that he's hoping to knock out. The side he's called home, or the country he's called home from when he was a young boy. But now on for Morocco. Morocco, who are still 0-0 with Spain as Hakimi loses out to Marasa. Ball forward from Olmó, who is poor, Saiz is underneath it once again, so dominant in the air, he's enjoying another good match. The Morocco captain, the former Walseran, for Spain pick it up just inside the Morocco half. Mid-weight through the second half, 0-0, and you wonder the longer this ticks on, whether Morocco will start to feel, is this Belgium all over again, two late goals, they want 2-0. And they do the same to Spain. They've also did the same tactical change as well. And they've got to see extra going play now through the middle a little bit more. So we shall see if he has the effect that he's had in previous games now, it's central. Here comes Spain with Rodri, out to the right-hand side, and Llorente, he's got both palms outstretched, so he'll give you an option. He doesn't have too many, so he goes to the right-hand side, and Ferran Torres, he does well. Masró, he does better than Morocco. Let's back gets a put in Spain throw, 0-0. Had a good game both of them, Hakimi and Masró, very very seldom have they been beaten by any of the players they've come up against, and that's when the real strong points come up, you can say the defence, but those two feel bad. Here comes Spain down the left-hand side, Jordi Alba plays it off Hakimi for the corner. I suppose this is when you're happy, if you've got Maratán, he's very very good in the up, certainly attacking balls, and this is maybe one area where Spain finally may actually play a ball into the middle. They'll clear the corner's shot, and Maratán will be thinking, please give me a chance. They've played it short, will they eventually get it in? Maratán is still in there on the move as Pedri pulls it back to Jordi Alba, and now Pedri wants more, and it's all very intricate once again from Spain, as Soler has it on the left-hand side, and now Pedri wants more. Jordi Alba will swing it in left-footed, poor delivery from the Barcelona man, he's picked up the clearance though, and Llorente will have it over on the right-hand side. He plays it forward as Spain work it all the way back to the halfway line. That ball did not go into the box at all from that corner, and they're in the centre-circle. Honestly, it's really disappointing if you're at Maratán. It might do now, Maratán into the penalty area, very good sliding challenge to just ease him out of the box, that was great defending by Ashraf Hakimi, and the ball is cleared away by Morocco, and they'll bring it forwards once more. And the ball goes out of play. It was a great tackle, Vicky, but it goes with his left foot, and it's one of those ones where really that's a right foot to tackle, and if you get that wrong it looks clumsy, so yeah, it turned it perfectly, yeah, it was a great tackle, but yes, he took a chance. He should give the praise to Aged, it was he who stood in the West Ham man, it just limped away from it as well, so we will keep an eye on that, moving incredibly freely at the moment as the ball is back with Bono up to the halfway line. 24 minutes gone in this second half, this round of 16 tie, and we are still to find the breakthrough against Morocco and Spain. Rodri in possession on the halfway line, squares it to his Manchester City teammate, Emirate Le Porte, and now Jordi Alba, out to the left-hand side, and Pedri now will pick it up, and Rodri, and this is where Spain can start to mesmerise you, but what will Luis Enrique be thinking down there as he, well, we can tell, he's pointing, he's saying get it over to the right-hand side, as he waves his right forefinger over to that right-hand side, where Ferran Torres has been whizzing up and down the wing, but it's central with Rodri, he plays it out, they're getting over to the right-hand side, now they are out there, Soler to that right-hand position of Llorente, but they've worked it back again, and Morocco continue to drop deep, it's 0-0 on five-life BBC sounds, and a cross-Africa on the World Service, here is Pedri, back to Le Porte once more. It's metronomic, isn't it? It's just metronomic. And sometimes that's impressive, as long as it's got an end product, and there's a zip passing, and a Speedy pass at the end, there just hasn't been enough of that so far from Spain. Soler will head off to the right-hand side once again, and now all the way back to Rodri, and the series got bored, and has come to close Rodri down, and now he drops back into that defensive line for Morocco, and Rodri has it once again. The G is, we presume from the Morocco fans, but occasionally, the Spain fans get frustrated with this sort of passing as well. It's impossible to tell inside the stadium, Morocco have been during Spain when they've been in possession, but depending on the thoughts of the Spain fans watching on as well, because they're not at the moment getting near the penalty area, we know that that's how they like to build up, and if they can find the final ball and get a goal, well, all good, but they've lost possession, Zeehash has played it back in, and Sais goes over the top, and he's defending here to do for Llorente. I've been waiting for this. The youngsters come on there, see who plays against the field back. Give them the ball, give them a chance. He's playing against Llorente, he's not comfortable. But here comes Spain, and now suddenly it opens up a little bit, as Morocco lose possession, excellent sliding challenge. Wins the ball back from Morocco outside their own penalty area, and the ball is over the top, Jordi Alba will win the header, but only into space, and will be picked up by Zeehash, midway through the Spain half. Plays it forward, Zeehash, it just ran past Amalah, and will be picked up by Llorente. Amalah looking a little bit tired out there now, but in a good position, but now has to get back into fend. They've worked so hard, these Moroccan players. Defensively, their discipline's been excellent. We thought it would be, they've only conceded once. Still so far at this World Cup, that was against Canada. But now, as we approach the final 18 minutes, is where that concentration needs to be maintained, and Spain haven't kept their concentration there. Daniil Mo offside, Morocco free-keep midway through their own half. 0-0. I think you may have touched on the most important point of the game there. The Moroccans have chased quite a lot. I mean, they've tried to keep their energy, they get back in the line, allowed Spain to have the ball in front of them, but it's much, much harder when you haven't got the ball, and you've played all these games, and again, you said right at the start, they've not made many changes, so you get to feeling them in Morocco, you would expect them to be more likely to win this game if they could win it in 90, more than 120, because they may get tired. Crossfield pass from Zeeh, after a lovely bit of skill, is intercepted by Llorente. That hasn't worked that often, the Crossfield ball from Morocco. I just wonder whether Zeeh could have just kept going down that right-hand side. He really looked like he was finished right there, but Spain have it over on the left now. Here is Dani Olmo, plays it in field to Pedri, close down by Amrabat, meant for the return ball to Olmo. That's quite fiercely backed by Hakimi Tabano. Zeeh tries to control, does get enough on it to send it to Amrabat, but that's poor from Amrabat, and it's just shouting at Zeeh there. Frustration perhaps from playing the pass, but also just wants Morocco to push up a little bit more, and Morocco, all of a sudden, I mean, Spain have slowed it to walking pace, but Morocco responding in kind, getting back into shape. And this is where tired legs, tired minds could come into the equation here. We're into the final 16 minutes plus at a time. It's still goal-less here on 5 Live BBC Sounds and across Africa on the World Service. Nico Williams is preparing to come on for Spain, who have it midway through the Morocco half-central position. Out to the left now it goes, and Pedri, Jordi Elba plays it in field to Olmo. All lovely term as he caught there by Amrabat, but he stayed down Olmo, referee says no. Amrabat then runs into the referee, accidentally. Spain have worked it out to the right-hand side, excellent defending by Masrao, he just stuck out a boot, dispossessed Ferran Torres, and clears it forward, but it's given away by the substitute as Azuli, and Spain pick it up once more midway through the Morocco half. It's got to take Nico Williams about 10 minutes to get on, isn't it? As the ball is out to the right-hand side again, Masrao is there, makes the interception, ball goes out of play for Spain, and now the change will be made, and it's Ferran Torres' number that's coming up, and Nico Williams will replace it. I suppose that's something on the feather in the cap of those full-backs. Players are playing against, keep on getting taken off, so they've done really, really well. So Nico Williams, maybe a little bit more direct, a bit more power about him as well, so the Spanish are trying things now. They know that Plane certainly didn't work, and I just wonder if there is a Plane being... Yeah, four goals for Athletic Bilbao this season, for Nico Williams, has featured in every match so far at this World Cup. Spain in position, 0-0 into the final, 14.5 minutes. Good skill by Busquets, very good skill, so went it back by Morocco. A little casual on the edge of their own penalty area, but they do get away with it. That was in the series back there, the tall, rangy centre half. Beautiful play on the edge of his own box. Calmness under pressure, a bit of skill as well, as CS plays it all the way back to Bono. Loose touch, almost charged down by Jordi Alba, and again, we haven't seen that for a while from Morocco, but they've just got to be careful there as the Kiwi is caught by La Porte, and that will be our first yellow card of the game. And La Porte is climbing, he never touched them. Now, the difficulty of this angle, referee is very close, tiny, tiny, tiny step, and the referee couldn't get to his pocket quick enough there, could he? He was desperate to get it out there. I think the referee felt that the challenge where he stood up was going to be made, but he took his feet away there. There was no great challenge, so I think he'll survive. Well, he's gone over there to have a word with the Kiwi, and he's been down, and whatever he said to the Kiwi is annoyed the Kiwi enough that he's stopped grabbing his leg, and he's been down, and he's been down, and he's been down enough that he's stopped grabbing his leg, and he's got up very quickly in irritation. It's more than how hard a toenail break can be. No, and that's the actual fact, but it's the tiny little felt. There's nothing more than that. The referee is getting his card out right away, desperate to throw it in the face of the Spaniard. This is really unfair. There's nothing in that, absolutely nothing. And there hasn't been a huge bunch of Spanish girls this game anyway. Spain in possession, midway through their own half, 0-0. 13 minutes to side of time to play. I think you're right, Pat. I think he thinks that La Porte is going to catch him on the knee, which would be a yellow, but then he doesn't, and he's already given the free-kick, and says, well, you might as well have the yellow card into the bargain. So here comes Spain, down the left-hand side with Olmone. Plays it back to Jordi Alba, now back to Pedri, looking for the run through the centre, will Ricochet kindly, Marata plays it out to the left-hand side. Jordi Alba's ball in, cleared away by Marocca. Danny Olmone will pick it up on the edge of the box and drive, and it's high, and it's wild, and it's wide. And it's not impressive. It really isn't impressive. And again, goes on, came with a chant beforehand. We've chatted a number of people who have watched Spanish football. Game ball, game was very, very good on it, just saying. It sounds a bit yawning, you know, it sounds like they're going to get a cup of tea. As you know, they're doing the great thing about the Spaniards before the hand, 10 years going by. That explosion, with that piece of beautiful brilliance that you would get from the great players, just not seen enough of it here. We watched it in the first game, yeah, it was impressive there. Even at the start of the second game against Germany, it was impressive, but it has faded badly. Might be kept in for Morocco by Enna Ciri, and Spain come forward over the halfway line with Biscuits. The Morocco fans still banging the drum. Our friend in the green trousers is there still orchestrating things. You've seen a couple of lion outfits in the crowd as well. Morocco's nickname is the Atlas Lions. They're the last African country left in this World Cup, the last Arab country as well. They knew they'd get big support here in Qatar, and they have done. They've come in their numbers, and they are seeing their side holding the 2010 World Cup winners, Spain, in this last 16 time. Spain now coming down the right-hand side. Ball in, oh, Dani Olmo was in there, and the sliding challenge was made, and the ball spins away. Good chance there for Dani Olmo, and he's saying, well, was I caught there? Well, I'm going to ask a question. Spain allowed to do that. Run out of play, I'm trying to beat them. They so rarely do it, that it kind of jumps out at you when someone like Nika Worms comes on. He's got a big trick on him, he's just causing furl's down the lane, and he just is possibly the best half chance of this half for them. So, it's really surprising that Nika Worms hasn't been brought on. Just to adapt it, ask a different question. So, Spain in possession. Here is Jordi Alba, I have to say, that was an absolutely outstanding challenge from again. No way, a penalty for Spain, but they're into the penalty area. Once again, ball is pulled across, good charge down. It's the Spain corner, Morocco, we're appealing for an offside flag. They didn't come, they stayed switched on, they defended it just as it would be, but they're disappointed that the flag hasn't been raised over on the far side. They want to make a couple of substitutions, but classically, you're not going to do that, going there again, so they're going to let this play out. And they played the corner shorts, full back, full Spain, and will be squared now to Jordi Alba. Dinks the ball into the penalty area, cleared away by Morocco and helped on on the edge of the box, but they won't be able to fashion the counter. This is the problem from Morocco, they're defending so well, but the players are so deep that there is no outlet really, and it's coming straight back at them. However, as Pat has touched on throughout this match, we know, we know Spain have the quality out of nothing, to gear up, to go through the gears, to put together a lovely move, and to take the lead and to break Moroccan hearts, but they haven't done it enough so far. What can Nico Williams do here? Place the ball through into the area, Marata down to the bar, and all whips it right across the face of goal. The angle was disappearing all the time, and it's across the goal line and spins out. Well, if he'd scored from there, it would have been pretty remarkable. Could he have done anything else, Pat? No, I think he did, evidently. The movement was good. Once again, it's livened them up a little bit, since they've made that change. Well, the two changes, Marata, they'll make the strikers run. So at least there's something to aim at. So he makes the strikers run there, he's very, very wide, so it's understandable, it didn't get in. But again, it's Nico Williams, a little bit of pace, go and ask a question about the defender, and it's livened things up a little bit. Well, for Spain anyway. So they're making three substitutions, that's right. There's a little change being made. And it's not really a huge surprise, that they're going to make those sort of changes just now, because they are getting tired. There's an exhaustion almost about the team. And it makes good sense, they've done that. So the players coming on, Waleed Shedira, Abdulhamid Sabiri, and Yahya Atiyat-Alar, Fort Morocco, Off-Go, In the Serie, Amalaa, and Mazrawi, who's had a very good game. We are still waiting to get back underway. Can I say, well done getting all them there, because they're coming so quickly. And the other thing is, players are going off the pitch all over the place, sometimes as well, you know, so it's hard to see which ones are going off, and which ones are coming on. But they needed to make those changes, Morocco. You just see a lot of tiredness creeping in, they're not getting off the field as often as they were, you know, at the start of the second half. And also, you know, if you get that liveliness from Marata coming on, and from Nico Williams on the right wing there, they need a little bit more vitality. Now Ziesha's gone down, so Morocco have won a free kick. So Waleed Shedira, he's the leading scorer in the Italian second tier this season, nine goals in 12 games. So he is on. Yahya Atiat-Ellar played under Morocco's manager Waleed Ragraghi, as they won the African Champions League with Waira Dacasa Blanca. That was the positive domestic spell that earned Ragraghi the Morocco job. And Adha Mead Sabiri, well thought he had a goal at the World Cup with that free kick that nearly went all the way in against Belgium, but took that tiny nick off Roman Saiz for my Huddersfield man as well, a handful of appearances for them. And having just made the triple change, Morocco might have to make another one as well, because it's the West Ham man, Naif Aged, who's put in some brilliant blocks, but he's been struggling in the last 15 minutes, and he just can't continue. So that's another break, and he has played very well. I have to say he's played superbly well. But you can tell when a player is just desperate to stay on the field, he does end that he stays on the field, but he's not able to do that. And El Yameek's going to come on now. And he's going to get a few questions asked about him, because Minata's movement's been much better. Everyone's always known about Minata's movement. It's always been good. The question in the past, was what's your finishing like? Is that good enough? And certainly in his period of time at Chelsea, it wasn't brilliant, but it's been much better since he's been back to spin. So Morocco, swing the free kick out to the left-hand side. El Yameek, another one of those who plays his club football in Spain for Real Valladolid. Taking part at his first World Cup, and Armorrocco to reach the quarterfinals for the first time in their history. The nil-nil with Spain, will they get, as they did against Belgium, one or two late chances? This man might help to create them. But the ball is in the area, the header is down, the shot on the turn is scrambled towards Unai C-Mod. Well, almost, almost, for the substitute Valladolid Shedira. In part, they're going to get those chances. That is the game plan. We've watched it, we've watched it time and again. They're becoming quite infrequent, these little breaks now, but they don't have to do it quite long, and they zapped up the field there. They say, if they're just waiting for that time-lil moment, they'll soak up as much pressure as they possibly can. And they do it with danger, so it's well enough that they're good enough to strike and they can go and attack that. That was a little more than a half chance. But definitely, that's why they've end up this period, isn't it? Our friend in the green trousers is clapping his hands together once again. The noise is rising inside Education City, because Morocco very much still believe. Four minutes plus added time to play. Well, it's one of those parts. We know where a goal from Spain might come from. They've got enough players on the pitch, but looking at the game overall and the performance so far, it is still one of those where you think, where is this going to come from for Spain? You would not be surprised if, you know, obviously it's getting close to finishing now and now. Who wants to take a chance when it comes to, you know, extra time, against the extra time? Because then there's a fair factor. If you lose a goal there, you will always be the member for it. And that's an effect, it's a very, very negative effect. People shouldn't think that. We should think of the positive things, but we do it negatively sometimes. Here goes Nico Williams down the right-hand side. Very good covering for Morocco. And they'll clear away. We should be able to clear away. But Nico Williams has done well to charge that down. The substitute Atty at Alado plays it off him. And it's a throw to Morocco deep in their own territory. It's one of those, as Luis Enrique squats down on the edge of his technical area. I'm not in any way saying that Spain came into this match playing for penalties. But when you've told all your players to go and practice a thousand of them before you turn up for the World Cup, there's just not a sense that Spain are too bothered about pushing this to win it in normal time. The nice and Spanish win. Here come Morocco. And they find a way through the lights blue shirts of Spain's defence. Out to the right-hand side. They go nice and a wanton. Almost, but Anahi can't pick up that return ball. And Ashraf Hakimi looks to the heavens because that was so close. That was a beautiful play. When they get the one touch, the one-twos, and the final thubs, I say they don't have them very often. But when they do, they've got real belief in their ability. And that was just like a leg. He was exhausted and he just couldn't make it to the violin with a ball he didn't put. Here goes Spain, though, Alvaro Marata in behind, checks inside the penalty area, pulls it back. Nico Williams' excellent sliding block by Anahi, and it's cleared away by Morocco. Huge chance for Spain in the dying moments of this game. But once again, it's a striker's movement. You know, Marata will keep on doing that. Nico Wernst on the right-hand side, they've lifted the Spanish side. Now, I think the flag went up. I think the assistant got that one wrong. I think he was onside. I'm pretty confident he was onside there. So, you know, he's got a little bit of that unlucky there because the break was great. Maybe the... Actually, I was going to say, maybe it was the second movement, but I'm looking at where the three kicks were taken. And that's the initial movement. So, having said that, via I would have sorted out, wouldn't it? So, free kick to Morocco. Out to the right-hand side, they go with Ashraf Hakimi. Dani Almo wins the header. Throw to Morocco. Looking to reach the quarterfinals for the first time in their history. But I have a feeling... And I don't mind bringing in the commentators, because a late goal is always a joy for the neutral. But I have a feeling we're heading to extra time. What can Spain say about this, though? Soler, Marata, and suddenly it's all clicking for Spain. Dani Almo down the left-hand side. Was he put down there by Anahi? Yes, he was. And this will be a free kick to Spain. And a belated yellow card for Roman Saiz. He wasn't the player over there making the challenge, but the referee unhappy with something. The key thing for Spain is this is a great position, just outside the penalty area, midway between that 18-yard line and the byline level with the edge of the box. You know what? I know they love to play a lot of football, but... Come on, Spain, put it in the middle. Please, put a cross in there. Give your centre-back something to attack. Give Marata something to attack. There's only moments left of the game. You've got to give him a chance to attack something. So it's a two-man Morocco wall, the bright red shirt. It's just being orchestrated by Bono as we enter five minutes of added time. The referee had already done the spray, and then Bono said, no, actually, I want it slightly to the right, so the referee's done the spray again. So here we go, free kick to Spain, swung in by Soler, looking for the run at the far post. And that is a huge chance for Marata, completely unmarked, just got underneath it, sends it over the bar, the man who scored in every match at this World Cup for Spain. It goes begging. You know what? He cannot believe he's missed that so badly. He has got so much space, he's just ghosted around the back there. They knew exactly what they were doing. There's a neat little block to get in the space there, but it's not an easy angle. He's almost a corner of a six yard box, but really, he's got to get that in target. Was he even close to in target? Let's see if it's hit his nose and gone over the top. Headed forward by Morocco, Rodri's underneath it, strong back pass to Una. Una Simon, he takes a loose touch and just gets away with it. Goodness me. Hearts in mouths, moments for Spain. And Una Simon raises a hand of apology because he was closed down so quickly there by Ezzel Zuley. My word. I just love to get Ezzel Zuley on the ball. We've hardly seen him on the ball, but I've seen enough of his movement. He is lightning quick. I've no doubt he's got plenty of skill as well, but he's never so far in this game. Manus to get a one-on-one with Valenti. And if he does, I'm back and you cared this thing. Now, Elio Mics gone down, and the free kick has gone Morocco's way. Avarro Morassar, it was involved. Just watching there because the Morocco manager, Waleed Regragi, has come over. He's pulled away a member of his own coaching staff, or I think was going to go and tend to Elio Mique. Elio Mique's now back up to his feet. So, Morocco very much looking to push in these final few moments. They're not playing for extra time. Of course, if this ball comes straight back at them, they'll drop back into that defensive shape. But interesting there that Regragi wanting things to get moving quickly, and the ball in, he's headed on inside the area. Misku, they'll try and go for it, and Ines Simon makes the save. The whistle's already gone, but again, it's Severe and Shadira in there. And the Misku from Shadira. I mean, that's as bad as the miss from Morassar at the other end. Yeah, but it's well offside, and I think there was no doubt it was offside. They had to play it through. But, you know, we do talk about high lanes now and again. It can get a bit tiresome. But that was stupidly high, wasn't it, from the Spanish side? And hardly ran a man from deep there and played the right ball, and that would have been one-on-one with Severe and it wouldn't have been offside. It was swapped for how high that lane was. So, Spain in possession. We played three of the minimum five minutes added on at the end of this last 16 tie. We're heading to extra time, unless either side can fashion a chance late on. Unaissimon plays it out to Rodri. Shadira, the tall striker from Morocco, just looking, moving around on the halfway line. But Spain will play it out to this left-hand side. But as Pat says, they won't force it. Can they find one more opportunity to try and unlock this red wall of Moroccan shirts? Out to the right-hand side, they go, and Nico Williams could put in on the far side by Azazouli. He felt Morocco should have the throw as well, but it's gone the way of Spain, taken by Nico Williams in field now to Imaricla Porte, out to the left-hand side and Jordi Alba into the final minute of added time. A goal now, surely breaks Moroccan hearts. So, Spain come forward, Danny almost gone down, and he's won the free kick. And again, this is a good position, just up from the penalty area. 12 yards or so, wide left. And Spain, we have to say Pat, have been invented from their set pieces. What will they try this time? Yeah, I mean, the last one worked very, very well. And when I took it on, it got the header, nice little block, you went to the back post, do they have an understanding there? The idea, normally, from this position, is just to put it on in an angle with the back post and let players attack it. A goal now, surely sends Spain through to the quarter-finals, and it almost went all the way through from Danny Olmo. The runners were in there, Bono didn't take his eye off the ball, and he shoveled it behind for a corner. Oh, Spain almost catching out Morocco, right at the end of this match. That's exactly what the ball described, and that's exactly what the ball split out. It was played brilliantly, well done, Bono. Corner to Spain from the far side. This surely will be the last action of the game. LePort with the header stabbed away by Morocco. It'll bounce out, will it go out for the corner? No, it hits the corner flag and goes out for the throw, but there will not be time to take it. 0-0 after 90 minutes. Extra time here we come. Pat Nevin. Yeah, and just to hope that some people get a goal, because I'm not sure the entire game deserves a goal, but at the moment there are a lot of tired players out there, and it may well be it's the least tired players, not the best players who actually end up winning this game of football. Here we go then, Mark. It's half an hour of extra time to come. After 90, it's Morocco 0, Spain 0. And we'll get to that extra time after the latest BBC News with Jill McKenzie. Take the World Cup with you, Qatar 2022. On BBC Sounds, this is BBC Radio 5 Live. Thanks, Mark.

And thank you to Lisa McCormack for the news. Not Jill McKenzie. Very difficult to tell who the news reader is from over here in Doha. Right, let's... I'll stick to that excuse. Right, let's bring in Guillem Balagay-Golus after 90 minutes. Spain's last four knockout games at major tournaments have all gone to extra time, so we shouldn't be surprised, Guillem. Yes, because we do like that kind of player that stops this happening. But at least the strikers on, they add a little bit of edge. Nico Williams on the right-hand side helps with runs on the right wing. But Spain likes a little bit of continuity. We were searching for a space before, now for the move that makes the difference mostly down the wing. And Morocco, they liked the quality in the last decision, but I don't know if it's maybe in Spanish, but they have paced, they combine well, and there is a sense of danger when they're next to the box. It's just that I feel that generally, at this stage of the competition, when you need more things, there's an alarming lack of layers and alternatives from Spain with teams that defend as compact and as disciplined as Morocco have done today. Was it better for you, Pat Nevin, Spain's second half performance? Mildly, tiny bit. I think Guillem's absolutely right. It's not that the performance is there, it's the substitutions that have adapted it and made it better and made it... You've got a focus now, you've got somebody who makes normal strikers' runs. You've got a white player who actually tries to beat somebody. Wow! So Nico Williams has made a big difference as well. So yeah, a little bit better, but I can see what Guillem was talking about beforehand. He wasn't hyper-excited with things, and yeah, I get it, mate. I'm on my fifth cup of tea. Your fifth, did you say? Yeah, because you know you're going to go, you're going to come back and nothing would have happened, so... Where is Morocco's threat going to come from, Pat, in this second half, in this period of extra time? Well, the broadcast is a period on. The hazards really, is your young player, the brook and the left wing, right? And it's one of those things, and now and again I see a player, and I think I've not actually seen you touch the ball, but boy, you look the right pace, you look the right attitude, so it may well be that the head and the left hand side is the biggest threat. We shall see. All right, Guillem, thank you. Back on the way, I know for definite this is Vicky Sparks. Thanks very much, Mark Chatlin. Out to the left-hand side, go Spain. As we get underway in extra time, Jordi Alba picks it up, Spain playing from right to left, 0-0 it finished after the 90. Spain in the light blue shirts with the change kit, the white shorts and the light blue socks, Morocco in the bright red shirts, the green shorts and the bright red socks, and Morocco, friend in the green trousers, has just had a little break in between normal time and extra time, but he's getting ready to start up the Moroccan choir once again. Spain in possession inside their own half. Morocco, who have enjoyed such an outstanding tournament here, looking to reach the last eight for the first time in their history. What can they do in extra time early on against Spain, as Shadira approaches the penalty area, trying to latch onto that ball over the top from Ziesh. It's cleared away by Llorente up to Nico Williams. Morocco will win it back, but illegally so over on the far side with Ezol Zuli and Spain in possession mid-way through their own half. So Morocco with Bono in goal, the back four now of Hakimi, El Yamec, Saiz and Atiat-Ala ahead of them at Tsunahi, Amrabat and Sabiri with Ziesh, Shadira and Ezol Zuli up top as the throw goes to Spain on the far side, and they have it just outside the centre circle. Spain with Simon in goal, the back four of Llorente, Rodri, Le Porte and Albert ahead of them. It's Pedri, Busquets and Soleir with Nico Williams, Daniomo and now Alvaro Marata up top. Most of them get the ball a bit more often to Alvaro Marata. You know he's capable of scoring, you know he'll make the right runs. If you put it into the right area, he'll get there. He's shown it already twice, he's had a head at the back post, he should have done better with, and also he's a run through where I don't think it was offside and he didn't make the best of the chance. But he's been just about the only player that Spansha had. He's been willing to go there and hurt himself to get into the dangerous areas and at Moroccan defence. Here are Zee Esch and Ashraf Hakimi linking up nicely down the right-hand side. Borgo's out of play for a Morocco throw and there's a little hand-clasped there between Luis Enrique and Hakim Zee Esch who almost bundled the Spain manager over and Le Porte taking his eye off the ball there. It does just keep it in and prevent the corner. It feels to me nice to see him on as Zee Esch drifts into this central position and now as Azuli will close down Rodri who clears long over the half-way line. If you're Morocco then, if you're their manager, Waliid Regragi, what's your game plan for extra time, Pat? More of the same, roughly, but the hope that there are some slightly older players and that's in the Spanish side, particularly maybe at the back. There's a couple that I've had long seasons and they've found it, may find it a little bit difficult. So make sure when you do get that break, that final ball, that final ball has to be much, much better. Zee Esch has been okay, but again, his final ball hasn't been up to very, very best standard. But you might only get one chance. You better take it. Ball forward looking for Zee Esch, but laterally the free kick is given against Hakim Zee Esch and that's one of those who has gone down. He feels it's a free kick in the referee's side. No, it's going to go the other way. He's really annoying the referee. He's just kicked the ball away again when he's sitting on the ground and you can't deal with that just now. He's walking back. He's not getting himself back into position. And at the moment, you know, if you're walking about in a little huff and your team loses a goal and you've got to walk up because you're in a bit of a bad mood, it's unacceptable. Well, he's not on a yellow card, Hakim Zee Esch, but the point is, under another referee, he might well be. Jordi Alba plays the ball to the edge of the D. That was tempted layoff towards Busquets from Carlos Soleir, but Morocco get the interception and Zee Esch has it out on the right-hand side. 0-0, four minutes gone in extra time here on 5-5, BVC sounds. And across Africa on the BVC World Service. And here you go, Morocco in behind is Shadira. The flag stays down. Shadira, brilliant challenge as the flag now goes up on this near side. But what excellent defending by La Porte. Again, he didn't know the flag was going to go up. Neither did Shadira, and really, he should have sucked that away, but La Porte superb defending. Jouan, I think he is offside, but it's a shoulder or a bit of the chest, something like that. There's not much in it. Trying to bend his one run, didn't bend it quite enough, but that's a little bit of a freiner. That's a little bit of a wakerer for that defence. They got back in time, and of course, he's not lightning quick, but you cannot give them that many chances. Jordi Alba in possession on the halfway line for Spain. Goalless in extra time in this round of 16-time. The Spain working out to the right-hand side, and Nico Williams here is Llorente now, looking for options. Plays it forward from Marasa, challenge for Saiz, stays down. And the decision is free kick to Spain, and Raymond Saiz just grimaces in frustration. Spain with the set piece midway through the Morocco half-right-hand side. He's got himself in front of the defender there, so it is a free kick. He didn't really need the rolling about, but he's got the free kick, and he's actually given a little roll-five to the defender. Well, he's up now, Marasa, just ambling towards the penalty area. Marasa, who has scored in every World Cup match so far, can he find the breakthrough for Spain? Chances have been largely few and far between that Dani Almo free kick, locked deceiving Bono in the Moroccan goal right at the end of normal time. As the ball is chipped over into the area, looking for Nico Williams. Well, headed away by Morocco and Natiaz-Ala. He's not the tallest at all, the left back, but good leap there to clear the ball away. The Spain have it once more with Pedri, looking for the run through the centre. The header this time run by Saiz will come out to Nico Williams, right-hand side of the box, very well stood up by Morocco on the edge of their own penalty area, and Azuli will try and latch onto it, defended well by Spain. They have a touch from Puskets, out to the right-hand side, and Llorente, here is Nico Williams once more, approaching the penalty area, nice bit of skills, getting down to the bar line, pulls the ball across just over the head of Marasa, and it's cleared away by Aljamik, and out to the right-hand side, where Llorente will pick it up for Spain. Nico Williams wants more good battle going on there between him and the Morocco left-back Atiyah Salah, and Atiyah Salah gets the better of him. That time it's out from Morocco, throw nil-nil. But it's another very, very good piece of play down the right-hand side. Williams has done far more in this game than the players he replaced, and he's been up for much, much less time, so he can hold his head high. He's done well, whatever happens in the end of this game. So a double change coming up for Spain. Andro Balde and Anso Fatih are coming on for Dani Almo and Jordi Alba. A reminder that both sides have the opportunity to make an extra substitution in extra time. So Spain now up to five. Morocco had already made their five in normal time, so both will get one more, should they wish to use it in Spain again? Just shaking things up with personnel as they have it just inside their own half. Nil-nil here on five live, BBC Sounds, and across Africa on the BBC World Service as Rodgery plays it out to the right-hand side, and Nico Williams, he won't keep on to it, and there's Alzuli does well down the left, Morocco in the throw. At the moment, I don't think you can call it who's more likely to score because of the breaking capabilities of the Moroccans, because they've already done it in this competition. Because the Spanish, you wonder if they're ever going to get desperate, or if they're actually that comfortable with the penalty kicks, with the possibility of penalty kicks. One big thing they'll say, they've made another couple of changes now, that should liven it up a little bit. Both white players have been changed, and they've got a lot of bit more pace and more directness in those white areas. So Spain in possession, just inside their own half. Nine minutes gone already in this first period of extra time, as the ball over the top looking for the run of Ansou Fassi, well-won by Hakeemi, and cleared away by Attyatallah, full Morocco won't be kept in by Alzuli, and Spain have the throw. Marcus Llorente will take it back to Rodri. And again, Morocco just getting the red shirts back and into position, as La Porte has made that excellent challenge to Denier offside, Shadira, although it would have been tight, plays it forward, and now into the penalty area, goes Marata left-hand side of the box, pulls the ball across, excellent header away on the edge of the six-yard box, and Morocco will complete the clearance through Azazuli up towards halfway. But again, that's good movement from Spain. Yeah, again, and it's Marata. He's on the shoulder, he'll make the move, he'll ask a question, and then he'll wasn't doing that in the first half at all, and he just looks a much more natural striker, and at the moment he looks by far the most likely player to score in that field. Ball out to the right-hand side, lifted in, bounces almost all the way through this time, and the shot was driven in by Baldey, and spins out of play for a Spain throw. It is all Spain at the moment, and Morocco are coming under real pressure in their own penalty area. Baldey with the throw, takes it quickly down to Ansu Fati of Barcelona out for the corner. I'm being triggered here, they've got a corner kick, and previously in that spin, they've taken some corner kicks, taken them short, they've ended up in their own penalty vaults. They seem to do the same this time, Spain, they really need to get it in, they've taken a shot, however. However, still, because they're still playing it around, and Pedri tried to play it in, and they might be caught here, Spain is Morocco trying to come forward, it's a good club covering clearance by Baldey. Now to play, but again, Pat, it's just wasted. Yeah, there's a technical term for the way they're playing their corners, they're rubbish. They're just a bit rubbish, they've tried to play them short, they end up losing the ball, they end up in their own penalty vaults, they end up defending from their own corner kicks, and I know they don't believe in their ability to just put the ball in the box, but surely it's better than that. And to be fair, Morocco have the height of Saís, who's been so dominant in the year, El Yameek is the same, however, they've got Marathe in there, as Azuli tries to trick his way past Rodri in the penalty area, and ends up fouling the Manchester City man, so it's a free kick to Spain. But just, if you're not going to swing it in straight away, do something on the third pass. You actually need to do something with it. I mean, teams work on their set pieces all the time, a lot of goals are scored from set pieces. You're actually just giving away opportunities there by not at some point making sure it ends up in the box. So Spain in possession, just inside the Morocco half, 0-0 on five-live BBC sounds, and across Africa on the BBC World Services, Morocco get themselves into a real mix-up at the back there, cleared away by Saís, well Bono was coming for the ball over the top, looked all day long as though he was going to get there first, but the substitute centre half, Jouel El Yameek, basically charges into his own goalkeeper, won the header out of his own goalkeeper's hands, and was lucky that Saís was there to tidy up. Yep, his eyes shut as well, and that's the problem, if you do change the centre-backs, and when they've worked together and look brilliant, both centre-backs, and they work well with the keeper, they all understand each other, but you have to make changes sometimes because of injury, and they've done that and the understanding certainly wasn't there. Let off for Morocco, two and a half minutes to play in this first period of extra time, 0-0 in the round of 16 with Spain, here is Pedri, plays it forward now to Rodri, and the half-way line will be picked up for Spain, and then squared back across to Imariq La Porte, left-hand side goes Pedri once more, and Rodri has it in the centre-circle, will go for goal from 40 yards, slips, it's over the bar, that's not what they need to try. About a real bad desperation there is no doubt that's exactly what that is, but you do have to remember, look players are tired now, they've had a lot of games, they've had a lot of football in a short period of time, they've seen it together, not looking on and walked up, where you'd actually come in to look a little bit of a rest as well. You can actually see that in some of the players, certainly some of the players in Sky Blue down there, they've been way, way below, what I'd have expected them to, and that all goes around the fact that that was a hell of a tired looking shot. It was, as Morocco come forward, nice footwork on the edge of the penalty area, and all the way through almost goes Shadira, and Seymour makes the save, that was a beautiful bit of play, set up brilliantly by Anahi, Shadira into the area, took the shot, Seymour makes the save, and now it opens up for Spain as Pedri tries to squeeze it in field to the waiting team-mates, but he won't find the light blue shirt and the ball goes out of play. What a chance for Morocco, and that's brilliant play. You know what, one will buy some distance, that's the best chance of the game. For either team, that is the best chance of the game. You just got to get it with some power either side of the goalkeeper, it's not a tough angle. He's gone well, he's got himself into very good position, Shadira hasn't he? He looks a bit awkward the way he moves, he's big, he's a bit lumbering, but he's got himself into a very good position so far, but he should have finished better. The build-up play into that was by Anahi, was magnificent, absolutely sliced through that entire defence in midfield of Spain and he should be ahead. Well, as Dean Anahi, a Spain Havages inside the centre-circle, was playing in the French third tier 18 months ago, made his debut in January and he's become a very important player for Morocco over the past year or so, Spain come down the right-hand side, cleared away well by Ramon Saïs. We played the 15 minutes in this first period of extra time into one minute of added time and Morocco will be reflecting on that chance that Shadira has just had as the ball is all the way across the penalty area headed out by Zee Esch for a Spain corner and this one there will be time to take. Now, what do we do Pat Nevin, do we go short again? Well, they've got about 20 seconds to take the corner kick so they'll probably play it back to the keeper. No, come on, they must put it in there, they must get a chance to attack it. They've got, you know, the ports got attacked, the Rodries got attacked. Sole is over this, Spain are players tumbling into each other really inside the penalty area and the referee has gone over, will he say that Spain will take the corner again? Got to, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I was a little, I think even looking at the corner when it's played in so, you know, it was just falling over each other, that's all it was but actually it was a pure corner and was getting the goalkeeper's hand so he's got another chance. There's a poor corner and Morocco will say, well, we didn't do much wrong there. But they have another corner to defend and it's swung in once again by Soler and Bodo Kams, gets a good punch on it, it's met by Llorente, cleared away by Morocco once more, out of play for a Spain throw. And the referee just telling Spain not to take this throw just yet because Marata has stayed down on the edge of the six yard box and it looks as though as the referee continues to talk to Marata, that will be that for the first half, the players are coming over, the substitutes are wandering onto the pitch. And now Pat Nevin, 15 minutes of extra time to play. I mean, I just, I don't think we're going to see Spain do anything different and Morocco, I mean, why would they? Their game plan is working absolutely fine. You think about it, with that break that they had there, that was all about pace, break, you'll get the odd chance, they got the chance, they just didn't take it and they could have been sitting here one nil off and Spain would have been trying everything, they would have been playing short corners and they actually scored that goal there, they've been throwing everything at Morocco, as it is, it's still wide open. So half time in extra time, Kelly, Morocco nil, Spain nil, are we heading for the P word? It might well happen and if it does, Vicky Sparks and Pat Nevin will be across every single one of them. Pat, you said to Chappers earlier on that you think that this game could be decided now by the team that's fitters, not necessarily the team that's best. Can you look at the experience in the Spain squad compared to that in the Morocco squad? Does that count mentally as well as physically? That's a great question actually. Before this World Cup, I'd have known the answer and the answer is, you go with the experienced players, they know they're playing in the biggest leagues, they're ultra fit. There's been times during this World Cup where the less fancy teams, the teams from Africa, from North Africa, from the Middle East have shocked the rest of them by playing at that incredible intensity. The Japanese have been like that as well for various games. So I'm afraid Kelly, it's such a good question. I don't know the answer. We're going to find out in the next 15 minutes. Well, that's exactly it. Only time will tell as to what turns out to be the difference. But again, it could just be about one moment over the next 15 minutes or else. We will be heading to penalties between Morocco and Spain. With you for the rest of Extra Time, it is Pat Nevin and Vicky Sparks. Thanks Kelly. So Morocco preparing to get us underway at the start of this second period of Extra Time. It's about nerves, it's about concentration, it's about executing the game plan. Morocco have executed theirs to a tee and they're going for goal from kickoff. Well, there you go. Sales over the bar. You know, Simon was watching it, wasn't too far off his line either. Well, that was certainly in the script at some point, wasn't it? It's absolutely nothing wrong with that. You know, a keeper goes and stands in the 18-yard lane. If he's not paying attention just for a second and you get it on target from the kickoff, there's got a chance. Here comes Spain looking for Marasa through the middle, cleared away by Morocco. Nico Williams is jumping for it, won't reach it but it will be picked up by Soler. 25 yards out, plays it out to the left-hand side but Ansifati can't bring it under his spell and the ball is out of play for Morocco. Goal kick. Just for a moment there, the player would not mention a great deal of his amrabat. And I've been watching for about 70 minutes now and I'm thinking you're going to have to go off any minute now because you're wrecked. But he's still going and he's still going. If you look at the middle of the field there, his head's down, he looks as if he's just about to go on his knees. He's been lit up for the vast majority of the second half there and certainly he's been lit up all the way through at the time. But wow, he's put in a shot. Absolutely, the ball is sent out to the right-hand side by Bonnet, won't be kept in by Morocco. Enjoying a great season with your own Tina. Sokian Amrabat has been with Liverpool amongst others, but such a key man in the centre of the midfield from Morocco who are level with Spain. 0-0, two minutes gone in this second period of extra time here on 5 Live, BVC Sounds and across Africa on the BVC World Service. Spain in possession, didn't get in the field. Amrabat will now close down, but Spain do work it well down the left-hand side as Balde will chase, very well defended by Ashraf Akimi. He's quality, isn't he? I mean, as a full-back, you know, we know he's got pace, we've watched him over there, he's got phenomenal pace. But he's reading the game, he's been fantastic as well. I mean, it's been one of the highlights of the game, is watching the full-backs against the Wangers for both sides, but none of them have actually won it yet, have they? None of the Wangers have actually won it enough to go and put the perfect ball and to set up a really nice piece of play. At the moment, I just want to see those full-backs getting a little bit further forward. And maybe he, more than anyone else, Akimi is the one who could do it. He launches the ball forward, Akimi looking for Zee Esch. We won't keep it in, and it goes out for a Spain goal kick. So, they can quickly buy Unise Seymon. Are we to see a little injection of urgency into this Spain side in this second period of extra time as some of that manages almost to steal that away from Busquets. It's all the way back with Unise Seymon as Spain do work it back to their goalkeeper. Well, he's picking and choosing his moments, isn't he, Amrabat? But he has given absolutely every drop of sweat out there. Here comes Spain, dinking the ball towards the penalty area. Llorente won't get there though, and Morocco will clear away. The miss cue though by Ezel Zuli. And it's a Spain throw as Luis Enrique comes right up to the edge of his technical area. Applauds as La Porte sends it forward. Ati et alas underneath it for Morocco. Head around and the Spain substitutes are out very quickly to try and get things moving again quickly. Llorente sends it back to Rodri. And I think there is a little bit more urgency about Spain. They're not changing the way they play necessarily, but in terms of the restarts, in terms of getting things moving, they've just upped it a bit. You're right, they have, they moved it. You asked the question, why do you not do that earlier? Are we able to do that earlier? Do you not think you can keep up that sharp edge? Or is it just the personnel that are on just now with the substitutes that they made want to move it that little bit quicker? I don't think that is the case. I think it's coming from the back. And here at the back for Spain is Rodri. Squares it to La Porte. Ball forward is poor, cleared away by Eliamique. Out of play. It will be a throw on the far side to Spain. And it's been a little bit more than four minutes gone in the second period of extra time. It's very, very noticeable that Marata has got himself nailed on to Elmir. He has made sure that he's against the defender who's most likely to turn off. And very, very clever play by Marata. Yeah, given up on getting anything out of Soiís, who's had another good game, the Morocco captain. But Eliamique, as Pat says there, has looked a little bit shaky coming off the bench as Spain charged the ball down just outside the penalty area. Morocco will clear away all that's not good. Saís has gone down clutch in the back of his leg. Or if that's a hamstring, that is terrible news for Morocco as they look to come forward. Shadira, they won't latch onto it. They have one more change. They can make Morocco and Saís is done. Saís is done and the referee stopped play here in Spain, and they're furious because they're saying, look, yes, he's injured, but it's not a serious injury. It's not a dangerous injury that we're worried about. Morocco are saying, well, come on, our captain's gone down, and the referee stopped play. Spain are in possession inside their own half. What's your perspective on that? I have no idea why he stopped the play. It's not a head injury. For head injuries, you stop the play. You know, it's up to the Spanish to decide are we going to be professional, trying to go and win the game here, and then go that bit of an advantage because the players get injured, or are we going to be, you know, doing sports and the like thing. It's their choice. I don't know if it's the referee's choice. There's 100 referees out there, because no, no, no, we make the decisions. But if you stop it to game, everything, someone goes down. You can manipulate the play that way, and I'm really surprised the referee stopped that. Really surprised. Well, he's trying to... It may just be cramp. Well, that's it. He's trying to jog. The stretch is gone. He's almost jogged over to the sidelines. Morocco have the substitution ready to go if needed. Badda Benoun. But Roman Saiz is receiving some treatment. They're strapping up that left thigh, so it may not be the hamstring. He may be able to continue, and Badda Benoun has gone to sit back down. So, Carlos Soler for Spain, just outside the penalty area. Morocco temporarily down to 10 with Saiz off the pitch, but he's such a huge player. If he can get back on, they'll be desperate to get him back on. Spain in possession. Play the ball out to the left-hand side. And he is back on Saiz. He's not moving freely, but he's back on to take his place in the defence. As Spain come forward once more, whether that's a wise decision or not, we will find out how freely can the Morocco captain move as Spain into the penalty area left-hand side, pull back across, cleared away by Morocco, and Amrabat will help it on, on the edge of the penalty area. Shadira won't latch on to it, though. There are some tired legs out there, and all eyes on Roman Saiz. How freely can he move? Because Spain, well, if they've got anything about them, they'll try and test him, but they can't keep it in. Nico Williams has let the ball go out of play, and Morocco have a throw in. And now, Pat, if Saiz is struggling, surely the aim for Morocco has to be keep it tight and get to penalties. I have to say, I am startled that he's still on that field just now, because the way he's dragging his leg behind him, it looks like a player that, if he's asked to go and chase somebody, he's not harming them. He'll ping that hamstring, or else he'll get cramp again, he won't be able to run. So this is a huge chance that Morocco are taking just now, if he can. Midway through the second period of extra time, they've won another throw down the left-hand side, Morocco. We have made five changes, though. They have, but they do get the extra one in added time, so that is the relief for Morocco that they get the one more change they can make. And it's one of those that, again, find margins, that there's the option there, should they need to use it. Here, Al-Spain in position. Midway through their own half. La Porte, out to the left-hand side is the option, but he coasted to me instead. Well, that's where you think, surely that's the ball, but he'll know only when he's in field instead. Do you want any of the things that's jumping out? I mean, just know, I mean, there's very, very tension in that stadium. Obviously, the Moroccans are really uptight about it. They would love to get to penalty kicks. Do you know why? Behind both goals. Yeah, completely in abundance. There's so many of those Moroccan fans behind the goal. Here comes Spains, he eschies down, Play continues, Amrabat gets the fit in. Oh, brilliant skill from Amrabat. Fantastic to win it, to keep it, and to have the composure to set Morocco away. Here is Shadira, driving towards the penalty area. Shadira into the box, can he find room for the shot? He ran out of legs, he ran out of room. He ran into Oonaie Simon. Do you know what? He is a loveable character, the way he won. He just looks so lumbering, but he keeps on going, he keeps on chasing, he does run out of gas at the end there and runs out of legs, even though he's just come on, his substitute, but he's given Rodger in La Porte something to think about. They have to watch out for everything, they're taking those runs. He's had two opportunities now, and still no gosh, are we? Five and a half minutes plus added time to play. Good interception by Hakimi, although Pedri has gone down and stayed down, and Morocco will come forward with Nahi, forward once more, Hakimi. No free kick. The referee say no, you just ran into your opponent there. And the referee's decided to be players down there, he's been allowed to play on this time. You know, it just seems to change all the time, that rule. Into the final five minutes, 0-0 between Morocco and Spain in extra time, ball out to the right-hand side, Nico Williams will chase, Ati at Alam will get there. That's been a good battle, it's gone down to play for a Morocco goal kick, and you have to say, Ati at Alam has been very good since coming on. Fabulous, still was there in my mouth. I mean, he's up against Nico Worms, he's come on, and he left the game up when he came on. However, Ati Alam comes on himself to you, I thought, well, they've got a problem there. Well, apparently not, he's lightning-quick, playing at scale, and totally fearless. Well, he's a player that manager Walid Ragraghi knows very well indeed part of the side, under Ragraghi, that won the African Champions League last season. Oh, I'd add Casablanca, the Moroccan champions. He's given several of those players a chance in this Morocco squad. And he's come on, the 27-year-old, and acquitted himself very well so far. Four minutes of added of extra time to play, then we'll be into added time. Nil-nil as Morocco pick-up possession, and suddenly Morocco are starting to stream forward. Ati at Alam, and there's Azuli just get themselves into a bit of a tangle there, and that might open it up, because suddenly that left-back position is vacated, and Nico Williams plays it in field to Marata. Marata bearing down on the Morocco goal still going. Marata, terrible ball through. Chance wasted for Spain. He was trying to play an Anzu Fassi, and it was a shocker of a pass. It was a great break for Spain. They had four players up there. Marata was one of them, didn't shoot, tried to feed Fassi, and it's behind. Do you know in that situation, last night with Brazil, they scored every single time, but the Spanish weren't able to do that. It was a shame though, because the misunderstanding with Ati Alam and the youngster Azuli, they came on. I mean, it was quite amateurish, that misunderstanding, the way it can say, and that was the biggest chance I would see Spain had to score, and they weren't able to even get shot on target. Bono clears over the halfway line. The Spain substitutes around in the technical area, saying, look, he's time-wasting. That shows that Spain really want to push on and win this. Morocco might settle for penalties, as Nico Williams, did he keep that in? Play continues for now, and the corner's been given, and Morocco are saying, that went out of play. The assistant is saying, no, he didn't. Yeah, nothing you can really do about that, because it's not going to go... Is it going to go to the... Is Jesus Mane? That's staggering. That is weird. No, it is definitely Jesus Mane. Looks like it's going to go to the goal kick, and he believes it's gone out. So change being made for Spain, Pablo Sarabia is coming on. And the substitute is being substituted. Nico Williams is off now. We're moments away from penalties. That's got to be it. Williams hasn't done anything wrong. That's not his fault there, and you just want somebody who's confident with a penalty kick. You wouldn't be surprised if you've gotten some sort of attitude from the Moroccans here. They're taking the time here. Who are they going to take off? They seem to have... No, they've changed their mind. They were actually going to make a decision there with... So that's it. That's the question, isn't it? If you take the nahi off now, and Sainz can't last these last few minutes, they probably want to make a change, but they want to make it the seconds to go. Yeah, will they get the chance? That's the question. Paul has gone out of play for a spain throw. 90 seconds of extra time, plus added time to play. It's goalless. It's Spain in possession. On five live BBC sounds, and a cross Africa on the BBC World Service. Here is Rodri on the halfway line. The Morocco fans inside this stadium once again, cheering and whistling, trying to see their team up to the line for penalties. And then we'll see who crosses it. But Llorente's done well. He's won the corner for Spain. Well, it was really tense. Look at the intensity of Spain. Much, much better now. They're going to make that change, and it is going to be a nahi who actually comes off. He's played really well. He's a lovely player to watch. He's got a silky scale, but he kind of cruises over the ground, and he's a player I would watch him every week. And on comes Badr Benu, who plays his club football in Qatar. His World Cup debut, he was actually named in the squad, the Provisional Squad of 23 for 2018, and then a late change was made tactically, and then the Serie got the place instead. The Spain, swing the corner in, is cleared away by Morocco, played forwards by Spain once more, out to the left-hand side. As we approach out of time at the end of extra time, and the ball is stolen by Morocco, they'll look to counter, but Spain should be there. Busquets is, and Tidey's all the way back to Uniceman. Three minutes of added time. What about the pace now, Spain? They're playing the way you thought they should have played. And now they're going? Maybe even more than that. They're trying to lift it, they're trying to ask different questions. It seems so late to do it. Hey, if you're going to score a goal in the last three minutes, it's the right thing to do, but it was one chance to take. You have a capable of doing quicker. Ball is out to the left-hand side once more for Spain, into three minutes of added time on five-life BBC sounds and across Africa on the World Service. Out to the right-hand side, and Llorente plays it in field. Sarabia, the substitute. Little bit of space on the edge of the box, but Busquets well blocked away by Saïs, who is still shouldering on. And the ball is cleared over halfway by Morocco, and we have two minutes for someone to find a goal or its penalties. Do you know what? Both sides has to take a penalty kick. You know, it almost can't run. Ball is out to the left-hand side for Spain once more. You wonder if that's why they're trying to keep him on as much as anything else. Spain in position with Busquets, central position out to the right-hand side. Sarabia, left-footed delivery into the area. The header flicked in and just cleared away inside his own six-yard box by El Yameek, and it's one of those parts that from our angle, we could not see where that was going. Could have been an on-goal, and honestly, see if it would have been had if given up in football. That would be heartbreaking and grossly unfair. So, corner from this right-hand side for Spain. We're approaching the final minute of added time at the ends of extra time. A Spain goal now surely breaks Moroccan hearts. They have the corner from the right. It's headed away powerfully by Shadira on the edge of his own six-yard box. Ball is back with Spain. Pedri wants it on this right-hand side and gets it now, midway through the Morocco half. We're into the final minute of added time as Busquets picks it up. Outside the penalty area, Spain looking to work the opportunity. Busquets out to the left-hand side. Ball is swung in right-footed, and Sarabia at the far post, all the way across goal on the tightest of angles, and the Spain substitutes are on the pitch, and they drift and melt back into that technical area because that was a huge chance for the winner to send them through to the quarterfinals. Yes, I grant you that it was a difficult angle, but there's a chance for Gordy. I think they might have even had the post. He's falling to put such an acute angle. And in many ways, that's actually a hard to have a take-off. Because keep us coming out, he's not at the angle. He's actually had the back post there. Oh, that's incredible course. Why weren't Spain playing like this before? Too late now. The width of the woodwork away, but it's not enough for Sarabia and Spain, and we are heading to penalties for the second time at this World Cup. Croatia prevailed against Japan, who will prevail out of Morocco and Spain. It finishes at the end of extra time. Morocco nil, Spain nil. Vicky and Pat will give you a couple of minutes to draw up your penalty grids on the back of your notes ahead of the penalty shootout at that game between Morocco and Spain. Guillem Balegay is also with us. Guillem Pat asked the question right at the end of commentary there. Why haven't Spain played like that earlier in the game? What's your answer? We are playing against a team that didn't want to play. It was still like that, and by the way, great choice of a way of defending. They were very alert, they didn't make any mistakes. That Morocco did were very good. They could have done better with the last decision when they attacked, but in terms of defending, they stopped us, they blocked us. We couldn't have a single space in the first hour, and then we went for a single move, especially attacking with Nico Williams. That didn't happen fully either, and we needed Ounei Simon to actually make sure that we didn't concede in the first half of the extra time. So it wasn't just us, it was the way that we were forced to play. But at the end, there is tiredness, there are players that want to play that shouldn't be on the pitch, as I think the centre-back of Morocco wasn't ready to continue, but in any case, the chances came. It was almost an on-goal of Al-Yamik and Salabiya, hit the post, the far post, and now it's all done to a lottery. Guillem Balagay, it is going to penalties. Education City between Morocco and Spain will be back there very shortly as the players are huddled around their managers, getting last-minute preparations ahead of that penalty shootout. The next game is a 7 o'clock kick-off at the Lusail Stadium. It's between Portugal and Switzerland. Your commentary team will be Rob Green and Alistair Bruce Ball and Ali. Big team news coming out of that one. Definitely. On a team news front, this is fairly seismic. Cristiano Ronaldo playing his fifth, and potentially, we're pretty sure on, his final World Cup, he's not starting for Portugal in this last 16 game. Now, that is a big call from Fernando Santos, of course. He has started the first three games. There's lots of Portuguese fans back home who I think will agree with the decision. We all know there was a poll in the newspaper back there, 70% were saying they would agree if Fernando Santos did that. He's done it if Portugal do go out of the World Cup tonight, and he's not starting Ronaldo, which he isn't. Then clearly, his neck is on the line. The one thing I would say just before you go into a penalty shootout in that game, Spain, Morocco, if Cristiano Ronaldo started the game, Kelly, it's very unlikely he'd play 120 minutes and finish it. The one thing it does allow Fernando Santos to do is, if it gets tied, what a substitute to bring off the bench, and what a man, obviously, to have involved in a penalty shootout if this game goes all the way later on. But I can't think of the last game in a major tournament when Cristiano Ronaldo was fit that he didn't start for Portugal. But that is the news. 21-year-old Benfica striker, Gonzalo Ramos, is starting up front for Portugal. Ronaldo does not start this game. Thank you, Ellie. And as Ellie said, what a substitute to be able to bring on. Should it be tied late on, and there are tired legs in that Switzerland defence. They will not look forward to seeing Cristiano Ronaldo on the pitch, but he doesn't start for Portugal. We'll be back there for the rest of the team news, and to build up to that 7 o'clock kickoff at the Lisei Stadium between Portugal and Switzerland. Meanwhile, last-minute preparations underway for a penalty shootout as the captain's head over to talk to the referee, Morocco taking on Spain at Education City. It was nil-nil after 120 minutes. Pat and Vicky are still there. Pat, this is a situation that Spain could have avoided. There were enough opportunities for them in this match. They just really struggled to get that final finish on the ball. Yeah, just a wee bit disappointed with them, actually, because the increase in tempo, as the game went on, I think they've done that earlier. I don't think Morocco would be able to stand with it. So if you're going to try and one-wall cups, you have to be, maybe, still a bit braver to be able to do that and take a chance with your energy levels to start a wee bit quicker than they did. However, they didn't. And as we speak, is that Hacking Zee, actually, I think? I'll try to see if it is. No, maybe not. Anyway, first penalty kick in a minute, Kelly. We're nearly there. Well, we're slightly behind you in terms of the pictures in the studio compared to at the stadium. So I can see Eunice Simon making his way to the goal, and the penalty shootout is about to get underway. Pat Nevin is there, and Vicky Sparks. Thanks, Kelly. So the first penalty will be taken by Morocco. It will be taken by Abdulhamid Sabiri off the bench, up against Eunice Simon, who with Bono is just getting his final instructions from the referee. Eunice Simon, who saved three penalties at Euro 2020 in penalty shootouts for Spain, two against Switzerland in the quarterfinal, which they won, won against Italy in the semi-final, which they lost. And of course, Spain have been here before. They lost in the last 16 on penalties to Russia at the last World Cup. Pat Nevin, as Luis Enrique says, this is a moment of maximum tension, a time to show your nerve, and that you can shoot the penalty in the way you've decided if you have trained it a thousand times. That's what he told his Spain players to do. He wanted them to repractice to 1,000 penalties in the last year. How will they fare with that practice? How will Sabiri fare here? He's had to wait too long. That's unfair. He's taking the first penalty for Morocco, up against Eunice Simon. It's Sabiri, and he sends Simon the wrong way, and Morocco score the first penalty of the shootout. We're happy for him because in this World Cup, the referees have taken an eternity talking to the goalkeepers beforehand. The first player up stands there on the penalty spot, suffering that pressure. That makes that 10-times as good a penalty as it was before. Well done, Sabiri. So now, for Spain, it's Pablo Ciarabia, who hits the outside of the far post in the dying seconds of extra time. Another substitute off the bench, up against Borno, the Morocco number one. Ciarabia to take Spain's first penalty to draw the shootout level in the early stages at 1-1. It's Ciarabia, and he's hit the post! He's hit the post again, just as he did in the match. But this time, how costly could it be for Spain? Advantage Morocco. You cannot believe the noise in this place. It's ear-busting. It took a long time to make up his mind there. He goes right away. That's probably put him off. That's not going to be retaken again. Had it been Justin, say, the post, I think they'd keep him there. I've saved it. He was already over there waiting for it. Ciarabia is consoled by his teammates. And it's Morocco's main man, Chelsea's Hakim Ziesh. A few months ago, he might not even have been here, but under the new manager, he's reconciled with the national side. And Ziesh, with the chance to get Morocco a 2-0 advantage. It's Ziesh! It's fantastic! It's powerful! It's down the middle! Morocco lead by two penalties to Nile in the shootout. Spain have taken one less. You know, seven personalities are made for that sort of situation. He's one of them. You know, he's got the sweetest left foot. He has just leathered that down the middle. People who've gone away probably have still gone in. What a great opportunity that's for the Moroccans and what pressure, though, on every single Spanish penalty taker. So, Carlos Soler places the ball on the spot. Bono, all in the dark, purple kit, is told to get back on his line by the referee. If Soler misses this, Morocco will lead 2-0 in this penalty shootout, with two penalties apiece. It's Soler! It's saved by Bono! Remarkable! If I should just dive to the left, that every scene he's seen is going to have a lot of look at it. I wonder if they keep us moved. We've got another look at it here. I think he's all right now. I think that's going to stand. Nape man for the Spanish. Absolute nape man for the Spanish. There's so much pressure on every penalty if there's no, and so much less pressure on the Moroccans. Wow, what a chance they've gone out. And what a moment this is for Bade Benu, named in the Provisional Squad of 23, four years ago, then left out for tactical reasons, nothing else, off the bench, late on in extra time, to take this penalty. It's Benu, and it's saved by Simon. It was a poor penalty, and hope for Spain. Morocco slip up, Spain back in it. Oh, that was a terrible one there. You almost seemed to scuff the ball. I think it might have even hit his left foot, and his right foot when he's taken it. Terrible penalty, very easy one for the goalkeeper. But his teammates are up beside him saying, come on, we're still here, we're still in this. And this man knows what it takes to win a World Cup. This man knows what it takes to perform on the biggest stage of all, Sergio Biscuits for Spain. Morocco lead by two penalties to Nile. They'll have taken three each after this. Can Biscuits get Spain on the board? Bono waits on his line. It's Biscuits, it's a central run-up, and it's saved by Bono. Spain have missed all three of their penalties, and a man of that experience, you didn't see that coming, but that's what pressure can do, no matter the caps, no matter the years, and Morocco are a penalty away from the first World Cup quarter-final in their history. There's absolutely astonishing, they've been put up in the kicks, there's no doubt about that, but they keep us ready to everyone, and he's gone the right way three times in a row. So you're right, not only has he got this one kick to get him through, there's probably a couple more after, if they need it, but wow, what a situation by any footballer. Ashraf Hakimi, born in Madrid, his parents from Morocco places the ball on the spot. He has the chance to send Spain out of the World Cup, and Morocco through, it's Hakimi, it's brilliant, it's deep down the middle, and it's history from Morocco through to the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time in their history, and Spain might have practised a thousand penalties before this tournament, but it doesn't avail them, they miss every single one, Bono the hero, Hakimi the hero, Morocco the heroes, they're through to the quarter-finals. And I can't argue that they don't deserve it, they've been brought away, they've walked through this tournament, they've had to defend it, some of it's been ugly defending, but it's been intelligent defending it as well, but there'll be scouts as well in top of that, but the heart, the fight, the spirit they're showing, but also the guts during those penalty kicks, I've heard a lot of noises in this World Cup, I've not heard one like that one, it's about a billion years off, and what a moment, what an historic moment, not just for Morocco, but for African football as well. For African football, that's really, really big, but for Morocco themselves, brilliant play, and Spain, I don't ever want to win this competition, but they don't actually deserve to be any further than this, just with the lack of effort they put in, there'll be a lot of talk about in Spain and what it means for the future, but Morocco, they couldn't care less. The jubilation, the sheer elation inside this stadium is remarkable, it is packed with Morocco fans, they have just seen their side make history, he said their manager, Walid Rehgaragi, this was the most important day in Morocco's footballing history, and they've made history, Pat. No, they've made history, they're still celebrating, the keeper, I've got to say it, Bono, what a beautiful day for that guy, it's absolutely perfect for him, he's getting thrown up down, the manager, he's celebrating as well just now. Behind the goals, we talked about it during the game, if it goes to penalty kicks, this is a home match, it doesn't matter what end, it's been when the toss, it doesn't matter what end the pitch, they're going to be taking penalty kicks into a sea of constantly moving Moroccan fans, constantly screaming Moroccan fans, they wouldn't take the penalties into the green trousers guy, who is going as well there, which is the wrong decision once again by the Spanish, what a moment, what incredible scenes we're seeing here. Do you know what, I didn't clock whether he watched them, or whether he was still whipping up the crowd as he's been doing, but I think he'd be forgiven for having a cheeky look over his shoulder, and you mentioned what a moment this is for Morocco, Pat, but absolutely a moment for African football as well, Morocco are the fourth African side to reach the World Cup quarter finals, that's after Cameroon, Senegal and Ghana, and we knew they'd have the support here in Qatar as well as an Arab nation, but what they have done here, while Idrik Raghi, let's just reiterate this again, he took over at the end of August, I mean this is absolutely remarkable, he managed to get Hakim Zeyesh back into the fold after he'd fallen out with the previous manager, and he brought players back in, Masrawi as well, and now he's in the middle of the players, he's been thrown into the air, and unfortunately they've dropped him, but it's a good job that Bono had better hands in the penalty shootout than the rest of the Morocco players did there, but I don't think he'll mind a bit Raghri. No, you're the only one who's got a chance to see that moment, the camera was up above him, and he was being thrown up, the look on his face was a face of madness, he has completely and utterly lost it down there, and rightly so, I'm looking at all the fans, the Morocco fans, behind the goals there, what they're doing is they're celebrating with the players just now, they've not even gone up the other end now, there's a whole bunch of fans, when I say bunch of fans, there's a whole end of fans up the other end, who are going to have the same celebration with them in a couple of minutes when they get there, it really is extraordinary, you can see, you can feel how much it means to this nation. And we've talked a lot in this tournament part about what Spain could or couldn't do, and of course they've been focused on them from being semi-finalists at the Euros last year, forget Spain, they're out now, that's done, how far can this Morocco side go? No one thought they'd have gotten this far, so in a way, there's a downside, it's the actual World Cup final this, and because it's a World Cup final, can they do that sort of thing again? Do you know, I don't want to put a rain in your parade, but I would be suspecting this might be the last win in the competition this season, they know it's so hot, they've done plenty, they're getting this far. Well they've started the celebrations in earnest now, they've done it with their manager, they've done it with their own teammates, and now they go up to warnings of the Morocco fans, as Pat says, they'll have to make their way all the way down the other end of the pitch to the other Morocco end which is waiting patiently, I don't think they'll mind a job. I think it could be a while, Kelly, before these Morocco players leave the pitch because they have achieved what no side from Morocco has done before, only their second time in the last 16 anyway, their first time in the knockout stages for 36 years, and now they write a new chapter in the history of the Atlas Lions, they are through to the quarter-finals of the World Cup for the very first time at the expense of Spain. Vicky, this has been a World Cup of tears, for Spain, Alvaro Morato is sobbing at the final whistle and led off the pitch, but from Morocco in the stands and from the players, there are tears of joy as they celebrate their progress to the quarter-finals, where they will play either Portugal or Switzerland, that game kicks off at 7 o'clock, and at the end of that, Morocco will know who they will face in the quarter-finals of this World Cup. Luis Enrique shrugging his shoulders, he looks philosophical, he knows that Spain had their opportunity, that this is a young Spain side who will be able to go again in four years' time, maybe even in two years' time at the European Championships in Germany, but from Morocco this is a peak achievement, and who knows what lies ahead for them in this competition. They've been a fantastic tournament for them already, and they stay on the pitch and they celebrate with those Morocco fans, and we can hear what it means. There are so many Morocco fans, not just inside the stadium, but across Doha, and even as they spill out and start to spill out at the stadium, at Education City, we will see the scenes of celebration throughout Doha from those Morocco fans who you'd imagine are going to be celebrating right into the night, here in Qatar as they progress to the quarter-finals of the World Cup. We're also joined by Mahir Mazahi, a North African football journalist. Mahir, we're seeing and hearing how much this means to Moroccans inside Doha. How much does it mean to Morocco for the national team to get this far in the competition? When you've been following this team over the last few years, there are so many great little storylines that make you the wider public and things like, in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, the last time there was a real significant penalty shootout, Morocco crashes out to the African Union's Berlin, and right before that, Haqouz-Zesh has a chance to pick a match away and score a penalty himself and he misses, and that really sets like a really complicated episode with him and the Moroccan national team for a long period of time. Vetter Benin, the third country taker for Morocco tonight, he was out practically all of 2022 because he had suffered heart regions after a COVID-19 infection. Now he's making appearance at the World Cup, so you really start thinking about all of these storylines combining. That's why it's so emotional for all the players and the fans. We're seeing how many Morocco fans have made it over to Doha to support their team. They were behind both goals, they were spread out across the whole stadium, but inside the country, obviously there are going to be celebrations. And does it... I mean, Vicky was asking Pat there about how far they can go in the tournament for tonight, although it's a football question that is valid to ask, but people celebrating this win, does it matter in this moment? They won't care, right now they won't care. And you've asked about Morocco, I mean schools have been letting children out one hour early to watch the matches and tie their factories, cities like Mohamediyah have shut down because simply two-thirds of their employees have called in sick on matchdays. The country literally shuts down when this team is playing it, and right now they won't care about whether it's Portugal or Switzerland that they're playing next. Right now they're just rebelling in all of this emotion and all of this joy that you see. And one final thing, we've seen, you know, it's been going viral when Ashraf Khakimi, for example, goes and runs and kisses his mother. But one thing that the Moroccan Federation has done a really good job of is sort of latching onto these intangibles, things like emotion and love. And what they've done is they've paid for every single player to have their parents at this World Cup. So what you might be seeing on the pitch is a lot of these players head over to this pitch side, go to the family box and hug their mothers because they actually really, truly believe at the Federation that that could be conducive to success on the pitch as well. Yeah, and part of that huge Morocco contingent here in Doha. And I don't know if you can hear them in the streets behind me here in the studio, even hear the car horns being honked along all the streets as Morocco fans start to celebrate. And there's people who aren't even Moroccan who will start to celebrate because they love a tournament upset, but you talk about that emotion and the fact that they have the support of their families here in Doha. And that's the kind of thing that, as you say, the kind of intangible that needs to be honed, particularly in the latter stages of a game when legs start to get tired, when emotion starts to take over, and nerves kick in in a penalty shootout. And that's where maybe they had the advantage over Spain. Absolutely. I think that's probably one of the most important points that we can make this tournament. Look, on paper, I don't think there's any doubt that Spain are probably a more talented side than Morocco. So where do you get the advantage if you're an underdog? It has to be with the intangibles. It has to be with things like motivation, home field advantage. I read a study from 2003 from Northumbria University that says that when players feel like they're playing at home, there's a 3% increase in testosterone. I mean, we underestimated how much of an advantage it is having, you know, the World Cup on home territory. And this isn't really home territory, but it kind of is, right? I mean, 15,000 Moroccans living in Qatar, tens of thousands have made the trip over, and then you also have the Espresso from, you know, the Algerian Dastro in Qatar, the Tunisian Dastro in Qatar, and even local Qatar is supporting this team. So those intangibles, as you've already pointed out, Kavi, I think are making all the difference. And when you're playing in a tournament where you can get through on, you know, penalty shootouts, and you have a good organized defense, I think those intangibles can make all the difference in the world. A World Service football correspondent, John Bennett is inside Education City Stadium and is joined, Pat and Vicky. John, first of all, is there any sign that anybody might want to leave this place? No, there isn't. Wow. I don't think I've experienced many atmospheres like that. I've been to five Africa Cup of Nations tournaments before, but that was something else. When the Spain players, as I'm sure you heard, were stepping up to take the penalties, the whistles were deafening. I don't think many footballers could cope in those conditions. And here, Mejia is absolutely spot on. I think the atmosphere had such a big part to play in this Morocco performance today and their performances during the whole tournament. And I have to, as well, take my hat off to Waleed Regragi, the head coach. He only took over, well, 80 days before the tournament started. What a job he has done. I was in the pretty much press conference yesterday and I was so impressed with him, Kelly. For one thing, he spoke in four different languages. The second thing, he kept everyone so calm. Everyone was trying to hype the game up, but he took the pressure off his players, but he was confident. He said, we're going to come out swinging. And that's exactly what they did. They took the game to Spain. I know at times there weren't many chances, but it was such a controlled performance from Morocco today. And I think they deserve to be in the last day. John, does Pat have his microphone or are you using Pat's? No, no, I've got mine. Oh, you're still there? I was just... No, no, no. I was going to ask you because, as John mentioned there, and Mejia was telling us as well, and you and Vicky have described, behind both goals there was this huge Morocco presence. And there was all that whistling inside the stadium. Every time the Spain players were going up to take their penalties, as a player, does that make a difference? Do you, even if you can maybe tune out with your hearing, do you absorb that energy? Well, different for different players, obviously, but the vast majority, of course it does. We're human beings. With all those tens of thousands of people screaming, shouting, whistling, trying to put you off, it's a wee bit harder than the same amount of people cheering you on. So what an advantage you gave them. We talked about it during the game, that if they could just get to these penalty kicks, that is one massive advantage that Morocco were going to have. And as I say, when Spain won the toss-up, and he's thinking, where do I go? Both sides of Morocco have nowhere to turn because the noise is going to be deafening. I was just thinking, you were talking about the Moroccan fans. See if you've got a flat nose, they're sook tonight. Don't bother, don't go to bed, you're wasting your time. I think the tournament needed this though. I really think the tournament needed one of Saudi Arabia, Morocco or Tunisia to go really far, to go deep in the tournament because their fans have really created something special in the city, not only in the stadiums but as Pat is saying, in the souk, around different areas of the city. They've really created a different atmosphere at this World Cup. So obviously the Spain fans won't like me saying this, but for the tournament, I think it's fantastic to have Morocco in the last eight. By the way, I've changed my mind. I think they've got a chance. I think they've got a chance in the next game. Right afterwards, I was talking to Vicky. But they're going to have these fans behind them again. They're going to have such belief. They have won the World Cup and now they're fearless. It makes you all go and enjoy it. So I've changed my mind. I think they've got a great good chance. I'm also watching. They have a fantastic chance. Sorry Kelly, I think it all comes from the head coach. He has given these players so much freedom, so much belief. And I don't think they will fear anyone going forward. I think they've got a great chance in the quarterfinals. And as Mahir was saying, they've got a way of harnessing that emotion and being able to channel it and use it positively. And that is something that may well help them when they take on either Portugal or Switzerland. We'll learn which of those two they'll be facing when that one kicks off at 7 o'clock UK time. I'm just watching on local television here in Doha. They've got a camera in Casablanca, inside a fan area in Casablanca. And the celebrations there are as wild as anything that we're seeing inside the Education City Stadium here. As Morocco advanced to the quarterfinals. So there's real celebration from there. Bono the hero with two penalties saved from Soler and from Busquets to give Morocco the chance. And Hakimi the chance. Hakimi of course as Vicky was telling us, born in Madrid and knocked Spain out of this World Cup. And Michael Colfield, the sports psychologist, says when people Google Bono in the future, the first thing you might get is a beautiful image of a Moroccan goalkeeper in the future. Guillem Balagay joins us now. Guillem, the flip side of all this celebration and this beautiful moment for Morocco and for their national team is that Spain are out of this tournament. A lot of the talk beforehand was about how young and inexperienced they were, how this maybe wasn't the tournament for them. But there have been moments from Spain that suggested maybe they might be maturing a little earlier than this. What's your first thoughts on Spain's exit from this World Cup? I could see coming. Many, many could see coming. And it's not just the fact that penalty anything can happen. It's just that you could see the progression in a tournament and this is no time to react, no time really to get better unless you are in the right dynamic and Spain wasn't. Start with Costa Rica doing well with Germany, we could have lost, lose against Japan. And here you have to say Morocco played better. And I'm not sure what Lucerne De Cours said about that, but they played better because they were closer to their game plan. So do you think Spain got their game plan wrong or they didn't execute it properly? The game plan is the one that we have. The problem is, and there is no other, Lucian-Ricke insisted on this, we got one way of playing and this is it. And it works well against bigger sides. I was hoping, against hope, that we could go through this. You wouldn't be impressed, nobody would. But then against bigger sides you're going to see a better Spain because there is a bit more space because they are size from now on that is wonderful as well. But against teams like Morocco, fingers crossed we don't concede in a counter, fingers crossed we don't concede in a set piece and fingers crossed at some point something happens that benefits us, but it just didn't happen. And that has to have, you have to put some questions on the table. Why don't we shoot from outside the box? Why aren't we good at set pieces? Why don't we have a striker that can hold the ball when we are under pressure? Why are we not more physical? And why have we chosen just one way of playing? It's disappointing, but I could see coming. You sound frustrated, Guillem, do you see this as a wasted opportunity at this tournament? Oh no, no, no. We're not, nowhere close to France, to England, to Brazil or to Argentina. We're nowhere close, we don't have that special player that Argentina have and obviously France as well. We don't have the prowess up front like you have.
