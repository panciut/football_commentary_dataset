 And certainly Croatia, bearing in mind, they've got Belgium to come next Thursday. They'll be targeting this to get the three points themselves. We're under way. You're listening to Five Live. Yet another game on BBC Radio Five Live that is live all 64 games. Right the way through to the conclusion of this tournament here in Qatar. On Five Live and BBC Sounds as the ball will run through to Boyan. 35-year-old, very, very experienced, actually born in Croatia but fled during the Croatian War of Independence, which was what, 91 to 95, settled in Canada. Now plays his football in Serbia. And vastly experienced keeper in his... in his aqua-green goalkeeping outfit away towards our right-hand side. As Canada slowly but surely will build from the back the shot count that they had against Belgium, 22-9. Yet only three was on target. And Karen Barzely was spot on earlier on when she said they just let that quality in and around goal. But Laryn has been brought into the side, good control, out it goes towards Buchanan. Buchanan with a cross, and Fulton Davies! What a moment for Alfonso Davies! Canada's first ever goal scorer and a men's World Cup. And he's produced the quickest goal of this tournament so far. What a start! They lead Croatia by a goal to the hill. Downward header, gave the goalkeeper no chance. What a goal from Canada, what a strike. I was just thinking, if Croatia want to sit off the way they have done at the start of this game, they're going to get punished. And boy have they paid the price. Jonathan David has brought the ball down off of the back four, turned, no one within ten yards of him. It goes wide, the cross into the box is decent, it's in a good area. And Alfonso Davies, well he's just arrived. Totally unmarked, gets up high, so free header is so simple, he just punches it down into the floor. So really good header, but how bad a start is that from Croatia? Well, well, well, what a moment. They drew blanks against France, Hungary and the Soviet Union in 1986. They battered Belgium but couldn't find a way through. And the man who missed the penalty has now scored what will be an iconic moment for men's football in Canada. The previous quickest goal so far was Gatka after six minutes. I reckon that was about 70 seconds. And Alfonso Davies has scored for Canada, who lead by a goal to nil. And all of a sudden, we said before that Grupec was fascinating, it has ramped up the stakes for last year's runners-up, or the last runners-up of the World Cup, Croatia from four years ago. But what a header. He gave Liverkovic the goalkeeper no chance. Coming in as a left wing back, the golden boy for Canada. A header that was simply unstoppable. And from a neutral's point of view, Matt, it really now does set the tone because Canada are going to have opportunities now to maybe counterattack Croatia as they go forward. It was almost a mindset of Croatia not to be close, not to get tight, not to push up the pitch. And they just allowed so much space to receive the ball. They dropped right off, invited the opportunity onto themselves. And we haven't even touched on the formations. I mean, Canada have started with a back four. We've got Lerea, who played right wing back in the first game, playing left back. So he's completely switched it up, and it looks like Davies has just got that free roll to go forwards and arrive in the box. Well, I said it was probably around 70 seconds. We knew it was the quickest goal of this tournament so far. It has been officially timed at 68 seconds. Wow. The fastest goal ever in case you're wondering in a World Cup was Hakkensjuk air in 2002, just the 11 seconds, Turkey against South Korea. But what a start for Canada, and what a moment for Alfonso Davies. You were keeping a close eye on that first goal as well, weren't you, Dan? I was, yeah. It's a little thing of yours, isn't it? Yeah, it is. Well, up until today, 13 of the 26 matches that we've had so far have been goalers at half time, which is quite a high number. We'll not obviously be adding to that one. And Canada with a rapid start, Croatia rocked back onto their heels. But it was a great cross from the right-hand side from Buchanan. Here is Kovacic, and it certainly now sets the tone. We were looking forward to this game anyway with the comments made by Herdman and how Croatia responded. They feel they've been disrespected. And certainly now, as the ball goes out towards Sosa on that far side, the left plays it to Gavadio, sporting the face mask, the very impressive Leipzig defender. By words, it will be a matter of time before we see him in the Premier League. A very, very strong target for Chelsea. Gavadio, only 20 years of age. It was a poor start from Croatia's back four, though, wasn't it? Yeah. He was really fearful, almost just sat right off. The ball was cleared, and Jonathan David, I mean, he just controls the ball. He can't believe a centre-back hasn't gone tight. You're early on in the game. You're looking to put a marker down as a centre-back. I'm going to dominate you as the opposition today. They just dropped ten yards. He plays it wide. It's just so passive. The whole opening from Croatia. This is Kramaric. Kramaric with the cross, takes it. He's got a defensive deflection. Loops in the air. Boyan actually lost it. Underneath the goal post. Whether he was caught in two mines, the ball in keeper. But as the cross came in from the right-hand side from Kramaric, he tried to catch it underneath the goal post. Took a technique of spinning, and then he caught it before it dropped to the floor. I think it was awkward because it was just sat on top of the crossbar, and he couldn't get his wrists round the crossbar to catch it, so he just had to pat it down. It was a convincing piece of goalkeeping, but I'm just having to look at the spaces again in the middle of the park between the lines. If Canada get two or three passes off, there's a big difference between the back four and the midfield from Croatia. Big gap in there. Good play on the near side by Luria. Played though back for Croatia. That was Joranovic, the right back, the Celtic defender. Sometimes you can get in danger of getting caught up inside the World Cup bubble. Here in Qatar, and you can forget that the FA Cup is continuing. The second round today has been more ties. Ebb's fleet united, Neal Fleetwood, Town One. Bristol Rovers, Neal, Bournemouth, two. Burton Alby in six, Chippendham, Town One. They are results. A latest score in half-time Newport County lead, Derby County by a goal to Neal, and on Sports Extra from five, there will be Ipswich Town against Buxton. That is a five-o-clock kickoff. You can hear that on Five Lives Sports Extra. But it's just a reminder of this, at times, an insane season with the World Cup right back in the middle. And the draw tomorrow night, incidentally, for the third round, will be at seven o'clock on BBC Two. Kramaric on the right-hand side, over the halfway line. He switched play out towards the far side that is headed away by Johnston. It was. Buchanan picks it up. He's running over on that far side. Buchanan slows down, almost level the penalty area, held up by Moderic. They lead by a goal to Neal. Hutchinson tries to join the attack from midfield, and then the ball is played away by Luca Moderic, just Canada lead by a goal to Neal. Attiba Hutchinson, who is the first Canadian player to reach an essential cap. The ball plays through. Flag stays down. Opportunity here for Laren. Very good challenge by Gavardiol to come in. It was a late flag. He did look offside to be fair to him. And it will be a free kick to Croatia. Yeah, offside, but really good tackle. Gavardiol, really solid centre-back defending. But I'm more concerned about the space in front of the back four. I mean, Croatia have to sort it out quickly. There's just so much gap between the midfield and the Croatian back four. It's not even having to be worked through cleverly. The ball can just knock down. It could just be a simple pass, and Davies is turning and just running at the back four, sliding passes. It's a really shaky start from Croatia. Croatia coming forward. Brozovic, out it goes to Perisic. There's a little step over, sends over across from the left, too deep. Moderic will retrieve it on this right-hand side, already trailing by a goal to Neal. The return ball, though, Moderic wasn't expecting that, and it's going to run out of play for a goal kick. Canada lead by a goal to Neal. So, Tiva Hutchison at 39. He became the second oldest outfielder ever to appear at a World Cup. Roger Miller at 42 holds that record back in 1994. It's interesting, though, that Team Canada, well, FIFA don't recognise the games against Guadalupe and Martinique. So, whilst Team Canada are saying that he is their first centurion, by playing here today, FIFA actually still have him as this is his 98th game, as far as FIFA records are concerned. But it's still a milestone for somebody who made his debut against the United States 19 years ago. And here he is, the captain, getting the ball back from the porto midfielder, Estiqui, now it's played forward, and, Jen, it was just tried to be helped on by Alfonso Davis, going a little bit inside to try and create the space for LaRia on this left-hand side for Canada, all in black. Out it goes. Perisic running forward once more, goes towards the by-line, at pace, whips over the cross, takes a deflection behind for a corner kick. Canada, the lead. That's much better from Croatia. Perisic direct on the run, doing what he does well in terms of the little step over, keeping his run down the channel and onto his left foot. Needy Johnston, who's playing it right back today, to be really alive. But, I mean, it's a bit of a shake-up in the front three. They've brought Livia in, who's playing down the middle today, and Kramaric has gone out to the right-hand side, but we need to see a bit more of a goal threat from this Croatian side. Well, it is a corner kick to Croatia. Far side to the left. We've been playing for just over 10 minutes, you're listening to BBC Radio 5 Live. Kramaric makes the run, played to his feet, laid back towards Modric, left-hand side of the penalty area, down towards the byline, clips over the cross, headed away by Estaki, picked up by Modric once again. Hutchinson was there to stab it away for Canada. Can the break be on here? No, held up. Vaughn eventually played out towards that far side, where the cross comes in, and that was Estaki's slice clearance, and it will go out of play for a throw right down by the corner flag. A little bit wild that from Estaki. He had a little bit of time on the edge of the box. It was a right foot, he swiped the ball, he really tries to put too much power on the clearance and just kind of slices it up in the air. Very nearly goes out for a corner, but throw in with Perisic. He's going to wait to take the throw on that far side to the left. In comes the long one. Comes into the penalty area, Kramaric's there. Davies, the goal scorer, manages to get the ball away. And then it's played forward by David, but Laryn wasn't prepared to chase it, and Gavadio will just drop back and now Lovren. Just inside his own half, another raking ball out towards that left-hand side. The first touch from Perisic, she's to try and take it away from Johnston. So he likes to be flexible with his tactics, John Herdman. We saw him with the three in the opening game, and as you quite rightly say, Matt Upson, he's gone to a flat back four. Interesting, isn't it? After having real success in the first game, the way they played, I love the link up down the right-hand side between Johnston, Laryn and Buchanan, I thought they really worked together in something a little bit different. Here is Moderic, Estiqui with a challenge midway through his own half. Incidentally, if you like your faxing figures, FIFA have retimed the goal and they've changed it by a second. Instead of 68 seconds, it's now 67. That will take some beating. What? The attention to detail all the time? At this World Cup. For the quickest goal. It was a great, great header, and what a moment as well for the player. Look at that again. See the space that is dropping in there. Just so easy, the middle of the park for Croatia is just wide open. If Canada can get any ball breaking a line from the centre back, firing it into a midfielder and attacking player that's dropped in that pocket, they turn and they're running into 20 yards of space. I mean, the pitch is just so open. The Croatian support away towards our left. Try to give the Croatian players a bit of vocal encouragement. There are pockets of Croatian supporters. Also over on that far side, always travelling great numbers. But it's been a disappointing tournament so far. Here is Alistair Johnston. Notice he's been linked with Celtic. Lariat forward on this near side, the left corner of the area, plays it back. A little bit behind the goalscorer Davies. Played back now to Laren. Laren's right footed cross, making the run in towards the penalty area, was Davies himself. And then there was a little bit of a trip there on Kovacic. And that will be a free kick. But you're right, they are finding pockets of space. Oh, it's too easy. I mean, Kovacic is going to have to have a blinding game today. He's that energy and engine in that midfield. He's going to have to cover a lot of ground from the start of this match. But I've just been impressed by the start of Canada. Sometimes it's hard when you score that early, though, Denner. You know what I mean? It's very early on. You can't get into that mindset of, right, we're a goal ahead, less now, start to be more defences. I'm sure the message coming on, looking at John Herdman in that tactical area, he doesn't appear to be changing his messages. Get out on the front foot, get pressure, keep probing, get another goal, and just keep taking this game forwards. Modric Brozovic challenged by David. Out of play, it goes for a throw to Croatia. Joranovic will want to take it just in front of his coach, Zlatko Dalic, who's standing up in that very large technical area down below here at this Khalifa International Stadium. And now Kramaric inside, little flick header by Brozovic, turned back and eventually it was Steven Vittoria to get the ball away under pressure. And out it goes for a throw over on that far side. They're just starting to see a little bit more of the ball, Croatia, as they look for an equaliser, 16 minutes into this contest here. Lovren, former Southampton and Liverpool defender, plays it forward. Kovacic of Chelsea, out it goes now to Gvadio, runs forward, far side the left, midway through the Canada half, Sosa is ahead of him. Reminds me of Jonathan Woodgate from his days back at Real Madrid. Sosa with the Alice Band and the long hair, if you can remember that far back, Matt. I remember it well. And here he is once again, Sosa with the cross, dropping inside the penalty area, fisted down two-handed by the goalkeeper, Bojan. Ball played into the penalty area for Peristic, who goes down. And it will be, if anything, a free kick to Canada as the ball runs out, harmlessly out of play, but it'll be a free kick to Canada, who lead by a goal to Nill. I think they've just got to be careful, Canada, that they keep focus, keep concentration. They're in that back four, which can be quite helpful sometimes in terms of knowing your role, understanding the space. You've got your centre-back partnership, he's gone with Vittoria and Miller. Vittoria very experienced centre-back, 35-year-old. So I think he'll be very vocal in organising that, and it's a bold move really, because, you know, Croatia, very much a front three, and I think he just fancies the fact that his full-backs can deal with their wide players, Peristic and Kramaric today. And that is the gamble really. Can your full-backs deal with those attacking players and handle those 1v1 duels? A bold move for mankind. It wasn't that astronaut. Fascinating. It was. It was, and it was great to hear how he linked his experience into football. Buchanan comes inside, plays the ball forward towards Larin. The return ball won't quite come off. If you haven't downloaded yet the BBC Sounds app, you've got the facility on that to rewind to any programme on BBC Radio 5 Live. If you were to go back to it just before 3.30, hopefully we don't lose you during the commentary, maybe do it at halftime, but Chris Hatfield, this astronaut, was absolutely fascinating the way he was talking about how he'd given a pep talk to the Canadian players. So it was around 3.30 on 5.Live, and BBC Sounds would certainly give you the opportunity to do that. Is that just because you asked a good question? He did seem to like it. It was a good question. Here is Hutchinson to Larin, lays it off, Buchanan, 30 yards out from goal, crosses into the penalty area. Jovanovich didn't know where Jonathan David was, and David actually wasn't putting him under any pressure, but Jovanovich is headed the ball behind, he's conceded the corner, Canada lead 1-0. Yeah, if you're in doubt, head it out, and that's exactly what Jovanovich did. He couldn't take a chance. David put the brakes on, he wasn't going towards that far post, but it's alarming how easy it is for the Canadian midfield players. Just to put their foot on the ball, get their head up, and chip one in the box, there's no pressure at all. Corner's been taken short, Millers up from the back, hasn't been properly dealt with at the first time of asking, and then dropping to one knee, clattered away by Gavardiol at the back there for Croatia, and then Canada all the way back to where to boyan, and we're in the 20th minute, and Canada are leading by a goal to nil. Miller, forward ball, David just inside the Croatia half, keeping the ball very well, playing confident football here, Canada, utilising the width, but they've lost it now over on that far side with the intersection from Sosa, who continues his run. His high cross, Kramaric with the cushion header into the path of Moderic, and he just tried to take it away, I think it was from Estaki, but all of a sudden it's been cleared, and now Davies, the goal scorer, is away, up against Jovanovich, Alfonso Davies with a low ball into the penalty area, he couldn't quite pick out Kyle Laring, and there was Gavardiol at the back once again, and now Brozovic will bring the ball away, and at the minute it's quite end-to-end. Yeah, I mean, it's a real mistake from Jovanovich, the right back, just tried to hook the ball back over his head, swung his leg at it, I mean, missed the ball completely, just about sums up the start for Croatia for me. Brozovic midway through the Canada half, he's given it away to Hutchinson, walking pace is Kovacic, invites Lovren to come forward in the centre-circle of the Canada half, every black shirt back behind the ball, full-backs pushed on to central defenders, seeing a little bit of the ball at the moment, Brozovic is the defensive midfielder at the minute for Croatia back towards Lovren, not a great deal of movement, has to go out wide right to Jovanovich, his forward ball, Kramaric midway through the Canada half, Lovren unchallenged forward ball, Brozovic now takes over, Modric passes the ball to Gvardjol, able to take the ball off his left foot, passes the ball out towards the far side of the left, Perisic has gone into a central area, Cross comes in now, easily headed away by Kamal Miller, able to turn off the chest in one swift movement by David, and he tried to volley the ball forward to Laren, the interception from Croatia. Kovacic accelerates, runs forward, edge of the penalty area and an outstretched boot. Kramaric, Kramaric, Lovren, and he just couldn't get on the end of it and it runs through to Bojan. Brilliant turn of acceleration from Kovacic, I mean he didn't have to do too much to break through that line, and for the first time in this game, Canada looking a little bit vulnerable in a similar fashion to how Croatia have looked in this game so far, and just a slight toe on the ball from Livia, couldn't get enough contact on it to steer it past the goalkeeper, but nice burst of pace from Kovacic, just let them know that he's in the game, and if you want to stand off and give that much space, there's a lot of space in the middle, both teams are allowing quite a bit of distance, it's not a condensed pitch at all, so I think we could see plenty of opportunities in this game. That's the insightful Matthew Uxson, the former England international defender who's with us here on BBC Radio 5 Live, where Canada lead by a goal to nil, a goal after just 67 seconds from this man, Alfonso Davies, who's forward of the centre circle, gets away from Kovacic, the forward ball, Gavadio with the interception, ball played forward then by the right back, Alistair Johnston, and once again they are committing men forward, Canada, they really, I really enjoyed the game against Belgium the other night when I was watching the television, the way that they played. Yeah, I mean, it's nice to see Davies in a slightly different position as well, because he plays that win back, there's a real lot of defensive work you have to get through, and you've just seen him, little clips snippet of him there, how good his feet are, how well he can go past players, I think that's the exciting thing that he should bring to this Canada team, he's doing it in this game. Uxson, a little tussle there with Modric, breaks back towards Davies, he passes the ball to Estiqui, now out to La Ria, back towards Davies once more, challenge comes in from that midfield duo of Modric and Brozovic, they both went into the same ball, but Canada still retain the ball, out it goes now towards Buchanan, just flashes his right leg around the ball without making the contact, then the cross comes in from the right back, Johnston, goes out from where it came, Johnston's header taken well off the chest there by Buchanan, tries to play the ball back towards Johnston, Canada really have got plenty of, must be six, seven black shirts in and around the penalty area, really making life awkward for Croatia, when they had it momentarily they've lost it, the ball is spread out now to La Ria on this near side, Joranovic shows him on the outside, La Ria will try and get there, Joranovic then makes a challenge, out of play it goes for a throw. A bit better from Joranovic, got tighter, bit more intensity in the tackle, not seeing enough of that from Croatia, out of possession, a little bit coasting round the pitch and just filling holes and not actually getting close enough to a black shirt. Canada with the throw, La Ria to take it on this near side, looked a foul throw, and it was a foul throw from La Ria. Reminder tomorrow, it's the final day of morning action actually on BBC Radio 5 Live, 10 o'clock, the Vildapul start as always at 9 o'clock, Cameroon Serbia at 10, we then got South Korea, Ghana at 1 in group H, then we go back to group G for Brazil, the game's Switzerland at 4 and Portugal, Uruguay rounds off tomorrow's action at 7 o'clock, so four more games for you on 5 Live and BBC Sounds. Croatia still trailing here by a goal to nil and cleared, long and out of play over on that side by Vittoria, the tall lean central defender, but Croatia haven't really caused Canada too many problems in these opening 25 minutes. Are you surprised? A little. Are you? Are you not? No, I watched Croatia in their last game and they didn't play with much intensity, and that's the part of this game that could be a problem for them. Lvivaja to Kramaric, takes it into the penalty area, does he get a sight of goal? Yes, he does, but the flag goes up, right footed, guides the ball into the left-hand side of the net, but his joy is short-lived as he wheeled away towards the right, he was faced with a crushing sense of disappointment that the flag was up, and of course will be checked, but the flag was immediate, and it looks like the ball to Lvivaja was, he was offside, not the return ball to Kramaric. No, it's the initial ball through to Lvivaja, he's about half a yard offside, his little one touch into Kramaric was good, and that's the first time I've seen Kramaric move with any real intensity, dropped to shoulder, fainted to go one way, then burst in behind, really nice link-up play as well from Lvivaja, it's just a shame that he crept half a yard offside before the ball came to him, otherwise that had been a really well-worked goal, and the first little movement of link-up play with Sim from Croatia, it was pretty convincing I have to say. It was an excellent decision from the assistant referee as well, at times you've seen sometimes that we might leave it for the VAR, but... He put it up early didn't he? As soon as Kramaric peeled away to his right, he just saw the flag raised, and he was the last. Sometimes as well at this World Cup, you get a referee from one country, and an assistant referee from another, and the fourth official from another, and the other assistant referee from the other, but it's the Uruguayan team that is supporting Andre Matonte here today, who's only 34 years of age, that was a good decision, and Canada still lead by a goal to Nile, that goal was ruled out for Croatia, Modric, out to Kramaric, and he's coming out towards this right-hand side, he's over the halfway line, they're playing in their white and red tops from left to right, but trailing by a goal to Nile, Lvivaja, quite a stocky centre forward, Perisic. Good tackle that. Tackled by Hutchinson, and cleared long by Buchanan. I think it was... was it Hutchinson or Johnston with that tackle, right back? Brilliant tackle, Perisic just had a slightly too heavy a touch didn't he, the decision he went early went to ground and really won the ball cleanly. He can play right over three, or as he is here tonight as a right back, the Montreal Defender, who didn't necessarily, that'll be a free kick, Lvivaja on Lvivaja, he didn't rule out a move to Celtic, but he featured the most of all the Canadian players in qualifying, but he along with Alfonso Davies are the two players who are on a yellow card, so should they be booked tonight, they would miss what could be such a crucial game against Morocco, whereas if you missed it earlier, Morocco in this group beat Belgium by two goals to Nile, and so they currently sit top of Group F with four points. But if it was to stay like this, you'd have Morocco four, Belgium and Canada on three, and Croatia on one going into the final set of matches next Thursday. But we've only been playing for 29 minutes here in the Khalifa International Stadium, and there is a long, long way to go. As Camar Mila also plays his football at Montreal, back to Boyan the goalkeeper, Hutchinson takes it over, Lariat plays it back, and now dropping back in between the two central defenders is Estiqui to Vittoria. They're working across the back to that far side, they're right. Estiqui takes over, plays it forward, trying to spin away from his man was Jonathan David. No fouls as the referee, it'll be a free kick to Croatia. They've got a lot of pace in their front players, Canada, haven't they? I'm looking at Buchanan, the way he's operating, he looks like he's got the ability to run past people. Alfonso Davies as well, obviously. Croatia on the attack, Buchanan with the challenge, and that will be no foul on Sosa. The left back on that far side, Derby County equalised in the FA Cup second round. Newport County won, Derby County won, it's a latest score. Canada lead, 1-0, Davies, got a blow in the face there, and it was right in front of the referee, Lovren, half an hour played here, Canada still lead 1-0, free kick to Canada. Yeah, I mean, referee couldn't be a better place for that decision, Lovren's not happy, because he's just trying to get his arm across to manoeuvre Davies out of the way. I think his forearms are a little bit high and the elbow just goes on the cheek or on the side of the head. The referee's right on top of it, just sees it, blows for the foul and it's a quite an interesting position. The left foot of Davies looking to whip this one in from the left-hand side, it's a bit of angle on it, it's quite deep and central, and they've got quite a few players forward, Canada. Certainly concerned for Croatia, they've got everybody back in and around the penalty area, just one in the wall that is mod-rich, he's preventing Davies going straight at goal, but it goes, it's a whip ball, actually headed away well under pressure by Lovren, picked back up though by Johnston and now Luria and he checks Lvivajer, the two of them are just having a little bit of a shoving contest in the centre-circle at the minute as he passed the ball all the way back to Bojan. I don't think he was too impressed with the lack of options. Headed forward by Johnston, who stayed out on this left-hand side, the right back. This is David, chips the ball through the middle, Estakir had made that run from midfield, Guardiola with the header down, Kovacic now tries to get it out to Paracic, who just about gets away with it. It was Vitoria who dived in and he only fractionally held up Paracic. Anything could have happened there, that was one of those moments that could have gone well or very badly and it ended up somewhere in between, didn't it? I mean, Vitoria came out and he made a bit of a gamble to get to the ball and luckily the ball just kind of like ricocheted between the two players a little bit and allowed a teammate to get back in and stop that, but that was a really dangerous move and they've got to be careful, they don't push too much forward, Canada. They're starting to commit quite a lot when they're high up the pitch and Croatia have the quality and the vision just to pick you off a little bit into those spaces if you're not careful. I've got to say before that moment, I was surprised that Johnston as a right back was over here on the left-hand side which then vacated the gap. Well, it's things like that that sometimes in terms of the game management, you're one nil up and I know it's early on in the game so you're not trying to hang on to anything but as a set play, don't stay up on the left wing, just make your way back into position maybe and get set properly. Cross in low from Juranovic, cut out by Miller. Lloria plays it forward and then Estaki knocks it back towards Miller who just puts his left foot on the ball, stands still and only when he is faced by Modrić and now they're being pressed by Croatia. Lloria up this near side, the left is being penned in and he's given away a throw which Kramaric wants to take quickly for Croatia, looking for an equaliser. Canada lead by a goal to nil here, just under 12 minutes to go to halve time. Alfonso Davis with the goal after 67 seconds. He missed that penalty after 11 minutes against Belgium. One of three of ten that have been missed so far in this World Cup but Canada have got some defending to do. Juranovic to take a throw. Long one and it comes now from the right hand side, rides up the chest of Kramaric, looks for a shooting angle with his back to goal, plays it out towards Sosa, the cross deep, flicked away only as far as Modrić, canons around in the penalty area and eventually Canada will play it out but have to concede another throw. That was not convincing defending in terms of just keeping your composure, making sure you get a good connection with the ball when you're trying to clear it. There's a lot of wild swipes at the ball, pinball in the 18-yard box and now defending what looks to be a long throw coming into the box. Another one from Juranovic, level the penalty area on this near side, the right playing from left to right. In it is, it's direct to the feet of Modrić, back to Modrić right hand side. Modrić with the right footed cross, tucked in there was Alistair Johnston to head the ball away. Modrić though has it once more, back inside to Brozowicz who curls the ball to the left corner of the area. Lvivajic plays it out to Sosa, back more now with Kovacic. Brozowicz, every outfield player in the Canada half. Modrić just starting to pull some strings coming onto this ball. The ball played forward now and then the shot away from Lvivajic and Boyan made the save, straight at him behind it goes for a corner. Yes, the running and the movement of Kovacic again is really starting to get things moving in that midfield area for Croatia. Lovely play, link-up play, picks up the second ball, then slips it into Lvivajic onto his right foot. I mean straight at the goalkeeper, but he had to stay big and just make a big block to put it out for a corner. Deflected off the knees of Boyan, corner kick to Croatia. Still trelling by Goulton-Hill, near side the right, right footed. Guardiola is up, Lovren is up there as well. Lovren didn't know where the ball was there as it last came off his head and went directly up in the air and he was looking to the left and looking to the right before it could drop. Sosa on that far side, the left for Croatia, plays it forward. Guardiola stayed back to Kovacic. Estekij is in front of him, passes it to the left corner of the area. They played it into Kramaric, flex stays down on this occasion. And Kramaric really equalised in nine minutes before half-time. We're back all square. Croatia won, Canada won. Well, you could just feel that one coming. The dominance of Croatia has just slowly been creeping into this game, bit by bit, they've been growing and growing, starting to get up to speed. And this was a lovely work move, really good passing. I have to say, Canada just switched off a little bit here, onto the left foot of Kramaric and that's a really good finish. He picks up the ball on the corner of the six-yard box almost. It's poor defending but a really good finish into the far post. Nobody had picked him up, had they? Not too sure whose responsibility it was, but he had so much space to turn inside left channel, the penalty area. Just an instinctive first time left footed shot past Boja, into the side of the net, 1-1. I think it was Hutchinson actually just switched off from midfield, he's just got away from him. And Canada have been pegged back after making that dream start with eight minutes to go at a half time. And the group changes once more. A point would mean that Canada have still got something to cling to going into the final group game. The only permutation where they would be eliminated is if they were to lose here tonight to the runners-up in the World Cup of 2018. But it's the Croatian support in their pockets away towards our left-hand side, who are celebrating now 1-1 here in the Khalifa International Stadium. And after having that goal disallowed on this occasion, there was no question whatsoever for the former Leicester City man. But his 21st goal for Croatia on his 76th appearance. I mean, it was just comfortable, wasn't it, in terms of how they moved the ball, Croatia? Not well enough set, Canada, not really kind of honed into the movement and areas of the pitch, and he just drifted off the back of Hutchinson into that space, and it was quite a simple pass through. Nicely worked, but comfortable goal. Croatia now are breaking forward, and it's Kramaric running down that left-hand side. He cuts inside to the edge of the area, and now Canada have got enough players back, and he waits for the supporting run of Perisic, and it goes away from Brosevic in that midfield, and is picked up by Borjant. But as Canada had committed men forward, Kramaric was looking to try and take full advantage. Yeah, I mean, they're looking quite vulnerable, aren't they, Canada, on the counter. If they're high up the pitch, it's probably the most dangerous position for them. Ball played forward to Karl Lahren, unable to really ever get the ball at his feet, and look convincing as a striker on that occasion. The move breaks down. They haven't, they've lacked that verve that they had when they played Belgium. I know, I mean, you don't know how an early goal can psychologically affect a team sometimes. I mean, it's obviously a positive thing you've scored, you know, and for them, especially in the World Cup, it's a big deal. But whether or not that just slightly changes your mindset, just dampens the fact you've got something to lose. You know, it can create that feeling sometimes, then, though. And you haven't seen the, maybe the same, quite the same kind of energy and freedom that you saw in that first game. Ester Kee has gone down at the moment. Creation voices you can hear in the distance inside the Khalifa International Stadium. Ester Kee, I'm not too sure what his problem was, but he's a very important player for them in the midfield. He likes to break up the play, plays for Porto, and contribute the odd goal too from midfield, Steffen Ester Kee. And just before he sat down, there was words being exchanged between Modrich and L'Orea as well. So a lot of the Croatians are taking on liquid refreshment at the moment. A reminder that we've got Spain, Germany to come from 7 o'clock. And then the reaction from today's games and the look ahead to tomorrow, your daily dose from Doha on the World Cup Daily podcast, available on the BBC Sounds. And also, whilst Ester Kee is down, she just points out another special program on BBC Sounds, particularly after yesterday's sad news regarding the death of Doddy Weir. There is a tribute to Doddy Weir all about the great man that you can listen to. Certainly when I used to speak to him in my days at BBC Newcastle, he was one of the few people, Matt, that I actually had to look up to to interview. There was certainly Doddy, wonderful man, and then they had a lad called Richard Metcalf, who was even taller than Doddy. And his nickname was Too Tall. And then when he played for Scotland, the Scottish International, they changed his nickname to Muk Too Tall. And I wouldn't be surprised if Doddy was at the heart of that for changing the nickname. But all about Doddy Weir remembering him and our condolences to his family and friends. That's on BBC Sounds. Three minutes to go to halftime, you're listening to Five Live. He sounds like an amazing personality. Well, yeah, he certainly was. And what he's done since. Yeah. I think that will be his legacy. What was your nickname when you were playing for England? It wasn't Too Tall. That with Lariat. You're not going to give us anything on that one there? No, I don't know if I've got anything to give to him. Boyan clears it away. Gavadiole rises in the air. Estiqui is picked up and is running OK after that treatment in the end of the first half here, two and a half minutes to go to halftime. Croatia won, Canada won. And Buchanan with a throw. They'll want to see this to halftime, Canada. It's not been a good last ten minutes, has it? They've been pulled apart a little bit. Croatia stepped it up, started to get their passing game going. Controlled the ball in good areas of the pitch. They mentioned that the running and the movement of Kovacic. They're looking like they could just pull apart that back four and move them around a little bit too easily. I'd be fascinated with the mindset of Canada, particularly in the second half, what John Herdman will do at the halftime team talk, bearing in mind that if they go all out for the three points and they get picked off, then they're eliminated. The one point might be something that they can then build on for their final match against Morocco. It keeps them in it, doesn't it? It does. So how much adventure they will play with in the second half? It's one apiece at the minute. Modric back to Gavadjol. Lovren to Yuranovic over the halfway line on this right-hand side. Gets the return ball. Yuranovic running away from Alfonso Davies. Just still going, helps it to Liliya with a shot. Great finish. Got it out for him and it's his feet so quickly. Right foot, it finds the bottom left-hand corner. And the man brought back into the Croatian side. Has turned it around just before halftime and Croatian lead Canada by two goals to one. Well, he's come into the team today to do his job, which is exactly this. Put the ball in the back of the net and he does it brilliantly with his finish. You know, credit to the build-up plate. It's superb on this Croatian right-hand side. The movement has all of a sudden kicked on another level. The directness, the energy. But Lovren with his right-footed strike, I mean, it's so clean. The ball pops to him, it's a tackle from Miller, who goes to ground. But he can't get enough on the ball to really clear it. It slips through to Lovren, takes one touch and it's a brilliant striker's finish. Right footed across the goalkeeper, into the bottom corner. Really good goal from Croatia. And if you're thinking what I'm thinking, then that conversation about the mindset now is all out attack as far as Canada are concerned in the second half because this is a score line that would eliminate them. So they're certainly going to have to get something from it. Croatia with two goals in eight minutes, and now leading by two goals to one. The quality of Croatia is just standing out at the moment, isn't it? The last 20 minutes. Perisic with the cross from the left-hand side, hooked away by Estaki. And they're actually looking for more goals now. We're into five minutes, I've added on time here in the end of the first half on BBC Radio 5 Live, but he just took it so well. Because he actually had to take a couple of touches to get it out before he could strike it right. It was kind of under his feet a little bit and he had to dig it out and then get it into position and the strike, well, super clean and accurate into the bottom corner. He brought him in because of his goal record of late. It's a lot, lot better than other strikers in the team. He's scoring a lot of goals domestically. Looks to be a good move from Zlatan Dalic. Hurchinson plays the ball out to David. He'll win a throw for Canada. They look a little bit shell-shot. Oh, totally. It's almost like they're just not coping with the quality in the movement at the moment. It's too good. They started the game well, but Croatia haven't panicked. They looked a little bit lackluster in the opening, probably 10, 15 minutes. I thought they were struggling a bit, but they certainly have come into this game strongly again. Croatia with Kramaric looking for Lvivaya. Timely header away by Vittoria, kept in play on that far side by Johnston. But actually, he's actually only presented the ball then for Perisic. She will pull the ball back. Here is Kramaric. Kramaric with a shot on the edge of the area left footed. Couldn't keep it down. Out of play, it goes for a goal kick. They still lead by two goals to one. Yeah, they've got the taste now. They really have great work from Perisic. Saw the touch onto the line. It was going to keep the ball in, Johnston, but read it so well, stole it from him, and then there's six players arriving from Croatia in the 18-yard box. That's the belief they have right at this moment in time that they can go and get another goal before half time. That's Matt Upsen. Peter Schmeichel will be in the five-live commentary box with John Murray, Kelly Cates presenting from the stadium for Spain, Germany at 7 o'clock. Germany certainly under real pressure going into that game. They have a dreadful record against Spain. So that's from 7. And like this one, you'll be able to listen to it and watch it through World Cup Extra on the BBC iPlayer. But we're in stoppage time here in the Kaleifa International Stadium, where Croatia, who were trailing by a goal to an ill, are leading by two goals to one. David, just outside the centre-circle, plays the ball out wide. Johnston does well to keep it in play. Ahead of him, a little touch now, is Buchanan, coming in off that right touch line. Hutchinson, now towards Miller. Estaki wanders across, backpedaling to this near side, the left, all in black, playing from right to left. Croatia have everybody back behind the ball. Hutchinson, the captain for Canada. Out towards Johnston, back to Hutchinson. Little touch from David, falls down. Jureguan referee not having any of that. Croatia now will break, and the ball goes through the middle, and it's to Kramaric. Lvivaya tries to hold his run. The support now comes from Brozovic, played behind him by Kovacic. And now Perisic's looking to try and get on the end of that, but scooped up by Boyan. Particularly down the left, they've caused Canada problems. They look relaxed, don't they? Croatia enjoying it, smooth counter-attacking well. When they win the ball back, they've got good runs forwards. They're timing it well, they look really comfortable at the moment, Croatia. Buchanan coming forward over the halfway line. Estaki out it goes, he's pulled out a little. Actually, David did ever so well to keep that ball in play on this near side, the left. Buchanan now in a central area, man over on the right, not required. He plays it short and forward towards David, but he's been shrugged off the ball. And all of a sudden the break is on with Kovacic, and Kovacic passes the ball out towards Perisic, and the cross comes in first time. That was Guardiola, who was leading the line. And I don't think he was seen, because the ball went out wide early to Perisic, where really the pass to Guardiola might have well been on. It had been 1v1 with Miller, or put it in behind Miller even, and he looked like he had him for pace at that moment in time. But another example of the ball breaking down is it's going into the striker for Canada, into David, to Jonathan David or Larin. They're just not getting hold of the ball, are they? It's getting stolen, and all of a sudden, Croatia are on the counter-attack, and it's just so open at the back for Canada. It was the central defender streaking into the penalty box. Corners been taken short on the left-hand side. I won't ask if you ever did that. I knew that was coming. I'm not predictable, am I? I was going to the back waving people up. Go on, up you go. So, back into the centre circle, you'd be having a word with the editors. Can I make sure I'm not working with him tomorrow night? Can we put Denham on the front paper with a maple leaf on it? Thankfully, the halftime whistle has sounded. Croatia lead Canada by two goals to one, and it started so well for the Canadians with their first ever goal at Amens World Cup. The header from Alfonso Davies, the quickest of the tournament so far, 67 seconds. But Croatia had a goal that's allowed, Kramaric, but then he did score after 36 minutes, and then Levae just before halftime, 2-1, Matt. Interesting game, isn't it? It started as I really thought it would do in terms of Canada out the blocks with the energy, with the purpose. Croatia, not quite as good as what you'd expect, a little bit laboured, and that's how they started, but whether or not the goal switched the mindset a little bit, or they felt a little bit fearful, Canada, they just haven't been able to carry that on and take anything to Croatia, who, by the way, hats off to them after looking really a little bit sloppy in the opening 10 minutes, have come right back into this first half and looked very controlled, very comfortable, and show moments of real quality. And Jules, feel free to talk to Matt, but only about the football, not about the Maple Leaf. Really? How did you know I was going to mention that, Matt, because I'm not sure anyone would want to see dinner on the front page of a newspaper. I'm just trying to get it out of my head, to be honest. A Maple Leaf. Well, it's a sight that you've just put into mind, thankfully. Crowe, I say thankfully, I say thanks very much, as in sarcasm. Croatia, though, Matt, you really confused me now with that thought. Croatia, though, turning this one around, they're now in control with those two brilliant finishes. It just seems to be they've been refuelled by that eight-minute spell when they scored those goals. Yeah, I mean, it's been really well measured, it has to be said, and they've looked like they could have got more, to be honest, and the way they're breaking, when the ball's breaking down in their own half, the speed at which they've got runners going forward, I think is brilliant. I mean, Kovacic is showing his energy, showing his pace, but also in wide areas, Perisic, Kramaric, they're looking really good on the attack, and at the moment, you just feel like if they get the right combinations and the right numbers in the right area, they're just going to pick Canada off. Right, so at halftime in that match, where Croatia lead Canada by two goals, just to recap, group F turned upside down, Morocco winnors so far beating Belgium, Croatia leading, as I say, at halftime against Canada by two goals to one. Now, just to say if Canada can get themselves back into this one, and it does finish a draw, it would be impossible for both Belgium and Croatia to finish in the top two, so one would definitely go out and they play each other in the final group game. But coming up, we'll head over to the Albat Stadium to check in with John Murray and Peter Schmeichel, our team in place for Spain against Germany. It's our final commentary of the day here at the World Cup on day eight. Germany will be going into that match in a much better mood after that Costa Rica success today, but at seven minutes to five here on Five Live, it's time for the news with Alison Hughes. Take the World Cup with you. Qatar 2022. On BBC Sounds, this is BBC Radio 5 Live. Police investigating the murders of two teenagers in southeast London yesterday say their killings are linked. Keani Solanka and Charlie Bartolo were stabbed within a mile of each other in Thames, Mead and Abbey Wood. Deputy Commander Richard McDonough is with the Metropolitan Police. Tackling violence is a priority for the Met. Days like today show that why our work is so important and why I must ask all again for London communities to work with us and our partners so that we are doing all we can together to prevent such tragedies. The Transport Secretary Mark Harper says striking rail workers must accept reforms if they want their pay to increase. The RMT union is due to take further industrial action through December and January in a long-running dispute with train operators. Greater Manchester Police say a man found dead in Wigan with potentially hazardous substances on his body had been shot and doused in acid. Liam Smith, who was 38, was found on Thursday evening. Energy supplies have been asked by the Business Secretary Grant Sharps to make sure direct debit payments reflect customers' actual use rather than high estimates when people are cutting back on gas and electricity. Some households say their bills have soared despite using less energy. He is our business correspondent, Nour Nanji. Firstly, energy bills have been going up so even if you've been reducing your use, average bills are a lot higher this year than they were last year. And secondly as well, worth noting there's been a milder weather so far so some firms may have calculated that into their assumptions. Now it is worth also mentioning that people do have the right to challenge their direct debit so if you think you're paying more than you should, you should reach out to your supplier. Protests against China's strict anti-COVID policies have continued for a second day with demonstrations in Shanghai, Beijing and Wuhan. People in China have faced nearly three years of mass testing, quarantines and snap lockdowns. And the Italian government has declared a state of emergency on the island of Ischia near Naples. After heavy rains triggered a mudslide which killed three people and destroyed several homes. Rescuers are still searching for survivors while workers are beginning to clear the streets of debris and mud. Available now on BBC Sounds. Two games down then two upsets so far today at the World Cup in the early game Costa Rica beat Japan 1-0 to blow Group E wide open. Three teams currently on three points with Spain of course facing Germany in the 7 o'clock kickoff. Then Morocco beat Belgium 2-0 to secure their first win at the World Cup since beating Scotland in 1998. It has been that long and here's their coach, Waiid Rugregi. We play against maybe one of the best team of the world with big players. We know today if you don't give 100% it's impossible to win but with these fans, with this player, with this spirit we can do a best performance is what he do my player. I'm very happy but you know the competition is not finished. He's only four points. You need to recover quickly to can play against Canada with all the team and you bring good results for the qualification inshallah. May I just ask you about the return of Hakim Sieh and just his influence on the team on and off the pitch. You know this guy is incredible. The spirit when he come in this national team is come back. A lot of people talk about him, about his crazy guys, his difficult guys to manage. He can't help the team. Me what I see when you give him a love, a confidence, he can die for you and is what I give him. He returned to me my confidence and the confidence of the fans of Morocco because a lot of fans of Morocco he won't Hakim is come back in the team and he know that but he's a key player also same of Sofian. When you have this player in the field same of Ashraf of Mazraoui is different team. He's a big player, he play in a big team in Europe and you see his different player with national team. And Hakim Sieh retired from Morocco GTO after he is left out from the off-con team today though. He put in that man of the match performance. It's the first loss in the group stages though at the World Cup so far for Belgium since 1994. The spotlight well and truly on Roberto Martinez and he was asked why Kevin De Bruyne had been so ineffective so far. Well we haven't been best Belgium yet. I think it's fair to say that we are not at our best. I thought today we played until the goal. We played a step forward from where we were against Canada. We never lost the competitive age. We never lost the desire to get results, to use our experience to work hard. But on the ball we haven't been ourselves. I don't think it's just Kevin. The whole team we played with too much responsibility. We need to try to find that freedom, the expression. And when you do that as a team, football is a team sport, then every individual can reach a higher level. At the moment our work is to reach that level on what we do on the ball and being able to be ourselves at our very best. I think as a team we haven't reached that. It's not just individuals. Also where today has been a big day for Canadian sport, albeit the men's football team are two-one down as we've been hearing first half against Croatia with Ian Dennis and Matt Upson at the World Cup. In the last hour the tennis players have won the Davis Cup beating Australia in the final. Bournemouth have confirmed Gary O'Neill as their new permanent manager. He's been in charge of course on an interim basis since Scott Parker left Bournemouth in August. And the Times are reporting that into Miami are close to agreeing a deal to sign Leonel Messi. They say the move from PSG is set to happen at the end of the European season. It would make him the highest paid player in the history of the MLS. There's a huge final game coming up later today though on day eight of the World Cup. Germany looking to recover from their opening defeat against Japan when they take on Spain, who of course put seven past Costa Rica. But the group have seen today which changed massively Costa Rica bouncing back from that defeat to beat Japan 1-0. Let's check in with the EuroLeague's duo and the Rumi's Raffa Hogenstein and Guillen Balagay. They've been looking ahead to tonight's match. Let's imagine the worst case scenario in Germany lose against Spain. You going home, Raffi? I don't know, I'll have to ask the BBC if they need me anymore. Maybe I can change tack and become the Swiss expert. Lots of German speakers there. The Netherlands is close to Germany, similar language. So hopefully I'll be allowed to stay. You fell in the group stages in 2018 and in the last 16 against England in the recent Euros. Another fall from Grace is unthinkable, is it? It was before the game against Japan. Now I think it's probably realistic to assume that they might get knocked out because in the heads of the Germans, I think the Spain game was always going to be a possibility of a bad result, a draw or a defeat. The idea was that it doesn't matter that much because you win the other two games. Having lost against Japan, that thinking goes out the window. Now they've got back to the wall, they need to win both games, realistically, to go through. He don't really want to go into a second group stage game against Spain having to win. It's just a really bad starting point. For a team that created a lot of chances, played good football for 65 minutes, but also showed some of the weaknesses and it'd be very hard to have full confidence going into this game. Let me tell you the things that we don't do very well. We cannot cross the ball to the box, no one is going to head it. We don't shoot from outside the box, nobody thinks of that. We don't defend half of the pitch, the last defender is in the halfway line. We're not physical, we're too young, we don't have a number nine. It used to be a criticism, the youth, the lack of experience, and yet you saw a team that read very well what was happening against Costa Rica and were very angry. So the players that were coming on just kept the level up. How do you stop somebody like that considering that even though you won the ball and you want to dominate, your own players are saying some of the players that we've got don't want the ball. That's what was said, no? Well, it didn't want the ball at some stage, that was a criticism, that there was not enough movement, not enough responsibility taken. I don't think it's actually inherently a problem that these players don't want the ball because you have a lot of technical players who actually love the ball. It's just more in the reference to what the moment or the situation brought. There are some issues I think with the passing from the back, which for a possession team then becomes difficult. Germany really struggled once Japan pushed them high. When Japan said back, Germany controlled the game beautifully, it was quite slow but created chances. When Japan pushed up, Germany created chances but had a lot more problems building up properly. And I think if Spain see that, they will press them really high and think, you know what, these guys are not that comfortable passing through the back in an orderly fashion. And they have to go long and we don't have those players either that win those long or second balls. So that would be Spain's game plan, I'm sure, to disrupt the German supply lines. But Hansi Flick was asked, you know, is this the time to change the system? Is this the time to play three at the back? Is this the time to be more defensive? And he was basically saying, yes, things are bad, but they're not as bad that we now have to completely jeopardize our idea and go to just playing on the break and just sitting back. I don't think this team can do it. Rafa Hockenstein and Guillain Ballagay there talking ahead of our final match of the day. Germany against Spain and Germany, obviously, as I say, looking to recover from that opening defeat against Japan. Over on Five Sports Extra right now, we've got FA Cup second round commentary for you if you want to take in the action between Newport County and Derby County. It's one all there. Following the conclusion of that match, you can hear Ipswich Town against Buxton. We're underway at Portman Road, Aaron Paul. Yeah, Ipswich, Neil Buxton, the lowest ranked team in the competition, aimed to reach the third round for the first time since 1950. But Kieran McKenna has lined up with plenty of experience in the side. Seven of the 11 that played last week in League One start and we've begun here. Three minutes on the clock. Ipswich, Neil Buxton, Neil. They're about to get underway in the second half of Croatia against Canada. Croatia leading by two goals to one. A couple of substitutions very quickly, just giving you the FA Cup scores elsewhere. Ebsfleet, Neil, Fleetwood won. Bristol Rovers, Neil, Borumwood two. Burton, six, Cipanum Town one. And it's all on BBC One tonight at 10.45. Match of the day, FA Cup second round highlights for you. Back underway then, very shortly where you are, Matt Upson, alongside our own little maple leaf, Ian Dennis. Thank you, Chills. Two changes that have been made by John Herdman. Jonathan Osorio has come on for Kyle Lahren. And Ismail Kone has replaced Estaki. Now we saw that Estaki had gone down at times in that first half. So it means, of course, that John Herdman will still have an opportunity to make, well, three intervals to bring on essentially three more players. But that's a double change at the start of the second half. And there are two midfielders who've come on from midfield and are forward. So I'm thinking that there's probably going to be a change of formation here as they just settle down in the restart. So Canada trailing by two goals to one on five live and BBC sounds. Croatia coming from behind. And Boyan is in goal. Johnston, Vittoria and Miller, I think now they're going to go with the three central defenders. Are they at the back? Or is it still a flat back four? It looks a four because to me, Larea is still playing at left back. So Larea then is at the left back. That's the defence. Then the midfield, you've got Hutchinson, Kone, Davies, Buchanan, Osorio and Jonathan David. For Croatia, Livokovic is in goal. It's a back four of Juranovic, Gvardijol, Lovren and Sosa. Brozovic, Kovacic, Modric in the midfield. Krameric on the right. Livir through the middle. He got the second goal that gives Croatia the lead. And so Canada have got to produce something in this second half. Otherwise, they will be eliminated. To be fair, I think it does actually look like a back five because Buchanan looks to have dropped back into the right wing back position with Larea in the left wing back position, which I think just frees Alfonso Davies up to play high up the pitch and centre forward with Jonathan David. I think that's more the thinking. They were getting unstuck too easily. They can't afford to go a goal down in the opening five, ten minutes in the second half. So I think they've gone to that back five just to secure it up a little bit and then rely on a breakaway or a bit of a tack in flair from one of his front three. So then we're looking at a midfield three of Kone, Herchinsen and Jonathan Osorio with Alfonso Davies now in a more advanced position alongside Jonathan David up front. So Matt Upsen with us here on BBC Radio 5 Live, two and a half minutes into the second half. And they've got it all to do. Have Canada, who in four years time will of course be one of the three co-hosts. At least they've finally ended their barren spell of scoring. Now just got to try and secure their first point at a men's world cup. Here in the midfield is Ishmael Kone. The substitute just outside the centre circle, all in black playing from left to right as we look. And it's with Herchinsen. Special landmark for him tonight with his 100th appearance. Buchanan's cross from the right, strikes the legs of Guardiola. That caught Herchinsen full on the face but actually falls towards Buchanan who chips the ball towards the far side and Leria was there in an advanced position with a cushion header cleared away by the Croatian defence. Pickback up, Osorio, edge of the deep, looks for a shooting opportunity just this wide, hit it right footed, it was around head height and it was adenising as it just seemed to pull wide of that left hand post just in the last moment, it looked goalbound for so, so long. Yeah, I really thought I was going to see the net ripple there. Really nice effort from Osorio, just come on at half time, drops his shoulder, takes on one defender, pops it onto his right foot and then just hits a really nice strike across the goal, little bit of dip on it but always just fading away from that post. When it set off, it looked like it was on target, didn't it? It looked like it was going to hit the post and go in or just nestle inside the post but with the swing of the ball it just pulled wide of it. My first World Cup for BBC Radio 5 Live, was it Germany 2006? One of my first games would have been with the great Jimmy Arnfield and he'd have said we were right behind that and we were right behind it. We just saw it drop, drop wide. Five minutes into the second half in Canada, that will offer encouragement for Canada. Boyan who is being booed by the Croatian support, Red Star Belgrade goalkeeper as the ball played back to Gavadio. Gavadio holds off the challenge of David and dinks the ball onto the chest of Buchanan and gets a throw for his trouble as well. Perisic, by the way, with the assists in the first half, he's been involved in more goals than any other Croatian player in tournament history now. Nine goals and six assists as the ball now is with Alfonso Davies. Challenge though by Modric. When you see the speed at which Alfonso Davies accelerates into situations, it's unbelievable. The coverage is accelerating now and he passes the ball out wide. Horses Krameric to collect that ball on the right touch line. Krameric with the cross too deep. Perisic should come in off the left touch line. Here is Sosa on this near side. What an inviting ball that was. And it was an awkward one for the goalkeeper. It was dropping around knee height. He'd gone to his knees actually and it was cleared away in front of him. Such a teasing ball. It really was floated beautifully with his left foot. It was right in that channel. The goalkeeper had to come but really anything could have happened. He was just gambling. He wasn't connected with by the first Croatian player running across the face of the ball. He just fumbled it out into the penalty box. It's all he could do really. It was a great delivery. Going to be a yellow card here shown. And that is to Buchanan for the foul on Guardiol. It was a deliberate trick. Just caught him on the back of the calves. And the first yellow card of the game is shown to the Canadian player. Really cynical, wouldn't it? Just nowhere near him. Tripped him up and that's not the first time Guardiol has gone on a little mazy run from the back, is it? As you pointed out in the first half. Gets forward, doesn't he? Not like all centre-backs. Croatia have come from behind. Derby County have come from behind in the FA Cup second round. Four-county-one, Derby County two. Underway at Portman Road is Ipswich Books and that was a five o'clock kickoff. That is actually on Sports Extra as we speak. Aaron Paul will keep us up to date should there be a goal. The draw tomorrow night is seven o'clock on BBC Two television. Free kick out towards the right. Hutchinson heads it away for Canada. Modrich, 37 years of age. He was the best player in Russia four years ago. Whether it's he, Messi or Ronaldo, when you see these great players, it really is a privilege to see them in the flesh. Yeah, he's magnificent, isn't he? The ability to see passes in the way just flicks things with the outside of his boot. I love the passes where he just lifts things around the corner. Little balls over the top, he's an incredible player. Eight minutes into the second half. Canada need a response. They're treading by two goals to one. Modrich loses out in the midfield to Kone. Out it goes to Luria. Forward on the left-hand side. Two weights inside the penalty area. Osorio makes it three. Hutchinson also getting up for the back. Kone can't thread it through. They might leave themselves vulnerable now to the counterattack. This is Kovacic just outside the centre-circle of his own half. Over the half-ball, over the halfway line, he carries it to Sosa the left-back. Croatia in their red-and-white checkered shirt. It's a playing from right to left as we look. And they're into their stride now. And in particular this man, Modrich. Out it goes to Kramaric, who waits back towards Modrich once again. Brozovic makes himself available. Lovely reverse pass. They've got round the back. Modrich pulls it back. Kramaric again. Excellent save by Boyan. He had all the time in the world to take the right foot and shut as it was pulled back. And Boyan moving away to his right made the save. And a crucial save too. Beautiful move from Croatia. I mean, it's a pleasure watching how they're playing at the moment in terms of link-up play movement. Modrich has the ball wide. He drops his shoulder to fate to go one way. Makes the running behind. Brozovic exactly on the same wavelength. Sides that little pass inside the fallback to Modrich. He's then breaking into the box. Head up, cut back to the penalty spot. Deserved a goal, didn't it? It was a decent save. It wasn't the cleanest of strike. I think any power on the strike would have took it into the net, but lovely move. Corner's been taken short. Modrich to Kovacic with the back heel. And the cross comes in on this near side. Alfonso Davies is back there helping out. Prevents it from going behind. Challenge though from Modrich was an unfair one. Said the Uruguayan referee, Andre Matonte. There's that little ball there for Modrich. A little back heel. It's the outside of the right foot. When it goes across his body, he won't use his left foot. He just manages to get his right foot running. It's like a little scoop, isn't it? Into there, he gets his head up, sees where the runner is. He's so good when he's at that goal line, being able to pick players out. Didn't he do that in the Champions League last season? With the ball that he just flipped over? Yeah, unbelievable. Canada attacking. Osorio into the penalty area. Plays it back, edge of the area. Buchanan goes square. First-time shot comes in from Jonathan David. And the keeper, I think, got a touch to that. Meanwhile, Lovren has been shown a yellow card for a challenge earlier on. The referee played the advantage. That was a very good attack from Canada. Lovely reply from Canada, in fact. Good play and an essay. It's an important touch. The shot's going in from Jonathan David. He dipped and maybe hit the crossbar. Livakovich has to get his hand on that and steer that one over. But nice break away. Canada just letting Croatia know they're still in this game and they're able to do damage if need be. Lovren was shown the yellow card. Hutchinson had gone off the field of play. He's come back on with a swab stuffed up one of his nostrils. There's nothing materialised from the corner kick. A swab stuffed up a nostril. And it was kind of... Oh, yeah, I can see. Just like hanging down as well. Must have got a bang to the nose. Off the ball, maybe. I didn't see that happen, did you? No, I didn't. The referee did. As soon as the ball went out of play, the Uruguayan official gave the yellow card to Lovren. Lovren's been booked. I can only imagine it was for that. 12 minutes into the second half. And Croatia leading by two goals to one. Don't forget, Rick Edwards is out here for five live breakfast in Qatar. He'll be alongside Rachel, not literally, from six in the morning tomorrow. Final day of morning action. Now coverage once more will start at nine o'clock. First game of four tomorrow. Cameroon against Serbia at ten o'clock. We've still got Spain against Germany. Oh, that was a loose ball by Boyan, straight to Perisic with the cross. But it goes straight towards the goalkeeper. He returns the ball to the Canadian, who now throws it out underarm to Buchanan, who sends Alfonso Davies away, teetering down the touchline, right-hand side, cuts in play, into the area, back towards Buchanan, shot charged down by the heels, across a bit, Kramaric back there, helping out. I mean, there will become a point, Matt, where Canada will throw caution to the wind, commit those black shirts forward, but then they run the risk of conceding more goals. Yeah, we may be not quite there yet, but we're not too many minutes away from that having to be the tactics, and they're going to rely so heavily on Alfonso Davies. I mean, he keeps balls in play that just look like they're going out of play, doesn't he? He's got this amazing kind of turner pace to get hold of something. Matt Upsen, an experience of scoring at a World Cup for England, 12 years ago in Bloom-Fontaine, who's part of our five-live team here in Qatar, Canada with the ball. Alfonso Davies, though, dispossessed in the midfield by Kovacic, nice turn from the Chelsea man with his experience. He just teed it forward towards Sosa, the left back. We've gone too far ahead of him on this near side, the left, and they've lost the ball, and Hutchinson now will try and attack that gap that has been vacated, but Gwadial just dropped across to cover, and then with Perisic, they've dealt with that very, very well. Yeah, good cover from Croatia, because Hutchinson just nutmegged Gwadial then, didn't get it the other side because he just got his body across and blocked him, but a little bit of a 1v1, and I think Croatia just starting to realise that sooner or later, like we just mentioned, Canada are going to really go for this game, and they're going to have to be ready defensively and then try and hit them on that counterattack. They certainly will attack, they'll look to go forward, they'll look to get something from it. He's got an opportunity to always try and prove people wrong, John Herdman, as the boos and whistles grow ever louder for Milan Bojan, from the Croatian supporters directed towards the Canadian keeper. Here is Lvivajer, taking off his toes by Vittoria, but it's not going to be Herdman who's going to be making a change. Instead, it is going to be Zlatko Dalic, who's going to make the change, and the player who's going to be coming on is going to be Bruno Petkovic, who's a forward for Dino Mozagreb, and Lvivajer, who got the second goal, is the player who goes off, so it's like for like. He's done well, Lvivajer, been impressed with him, got a good domestic goal record at the moment, which I think is why that change has been made, because Croatia, not looking too hot up front in the first game, I think only two shots on target, lots of little creative situations, but no real cutting edge, and he's brought a little bit of that today, and that's to be said, took his goal excellently. He certainly did. He just goes up and has a little handshake, and then a hook from Zlatko Dalic. Quite stocky, wasn't he, Lvivajer? Yeah, he certainly was. But as you say, that goal just before half-time to give Croatia this freshest lead. I actually like Kramaric wider of the three as well. I think that suits him, that role, because he's really pacey. He doesn't mind the 1v1 situations, not just one of these players that's in the box and likes to go on the end of things, which I think Lvivajer is more that out-and-out kind of striker that likes to stay central. I think Kramaric has looked good in wide areas here. Vardiole again with another well-timed sliding challenge, and it will go out for a throw, because Davies had skipped over the first challenge. Now, we've said that they've made the changes at half-time, and they've still got other opportunities. Here is another one of those for Canada, and it is Luria who comes off, and it's junior Hoylert, the ex-Blackburn Queensport Rangers and Cardiff player who's going to be coming on now at Reading, of course, for his 48th cap. So Hoylert is on, and Canada have been awarded a free kick quite close to the right corner of the penalty area. I mean, it looks like Buchanan has gone over to the left wing-back position, I think, from how that started. I look at the replay on Davies, and he's given a foul away, and it's literally right on the corner of the 18-yard box, and this is dangerous territory for somebody with his kind of left foot. If he gets a good delivery in the box, I don't know if he's going to shoot a goal, but is Taylor made for any kind of Canadian players running across the face of this ball can make life very different for Liverkowicz and Goldfoot Croatia? Canada are playing from left to right. They're trailing by two goals to one. It's a free kick, right corner of the area. Alfonso Davies did go for goal, and he's struck the leg to the three-man wall. Out of play, it goes for a throw. They're trying to go underneath the wall, though. It looked like he went to try and go low and into that near post area, hoping that the Croatian wall would jump. Remember, though, when we were talking about Cavadio, it was around transfer deadline day, and we had Christopher Vival on from Leipzig. I think the sporting director, he'll be moving to Chelsea very, very soon, if he hasn't already. I remember asking him about Cavadio, and he said he will become the best central defender in the world, which was... It's quite an endorsement. It is, yeah. And certainly would... help, I would imagine, if Chelsea were to pursue their interest in the Leipzig defender. They signed in for £16 million from Dino Mope. He looks very good, then, I have to say. You know, he's... very mobile, faster across the ground. Gets forward as well. We've been playing for over an hour, and Croatia are leading 2-1. Canada are facing elimination in the first World Cup finals in the men's tournament since 1986. Croatia with Modric, right-hand side. Modric tries to get away from the challenge over on that far side. It was Osorio who was back there helping out, and Lovren plays it back to Cavadio, who Richard had been talking about. It just feels an element of control that Croatia have in this game at the moment. Yeah, they've had it probably since about 20 minutes into the game, I would say. They didn't open particularly well, but since then, and maybe the goal going in is just giving them a little shake-up to say, right, we need to step it up here, guys, and I think the whole team generally has done that. They've looked very much in control, slick passing moves, and they've competed a lot, lot better, which they were struggling. They gave Canada too much space early on, and they got exploited and hats off to how they've reacted, and I think they've put in a good team performance since then. Well, certainly they're in a good run of form. They've only lost one of their last 17 matches of Croatia. That was against Austria in June. Perisic with the throw on this left-hand side. It just helps it on its way towards Kovacic, effective in the midfield. That was a nice little back heel. Perisic and Kovacic linking up, and they get another throw on this new side of the left. 65 minutes we have played so far in the Kaleepa International Stadium. And waiting to take this throw is Perisic, and it goes now over the head of Petkovic. Hoylert linking up with Alfonso Davies, then it breaks down. Guardiol likes to get forward at every opportunity. It was his low ball in from the left that has been bowled out by Boyan. Canada has just appeared to have lost their way. They're not putting anything together at all at the moment. I know they've made some substitutions. Sometimes that can just unsettle things a little bit, but they're sat in their shape at the moment. But in terms of attacking-wise, they probably had one real opportunity they've put together that has come from a good piece of play, where they've had possession and developed a situation. But other than that, in this second half, they've really struggled to really string passes together and get up the pitch. Alfonso Davies turns. He finds Kone in the central point midway through the Croatia half. That was excellent defending by Juranovic. He read that through himself at it, sliding forward, clattered it out of play for a throw that Canada will take. But we're approaching the midway point of the second half here on BBC Radio 5 Live. And it's Croatia who still have the slender lead. This is Hoylert being forced back by Sosa, the left-back, forcing him back over the halfway line. Hutchinson drops in between the central defenders. Milano hits a left-footed ball up towards Buchanan, who's now popped up on the left-hand side, and he gets a throw. He's taken over that left-wing-back position since the last change, and I think Hoylert is playing a lot higher, maybe just off the front, too. Here is Vittoria in the centre-circle along the ground. Johnston has gone into a central area. He's been given away easily read by Modric, who glides over the surface, shrugs off the one challenge, plays the ball to Petkovic, who was behind Kramaric, who looks a little annoyed at the ball. It would have been a decent attack for Croatia until it broke down. Now, all of a sudden, there's a chance to try and get Alfonso Davies away, but that was again bred very, very well by Kovadil. It was brilliant. He's been outstanding. Yeah, that was brilliant. That was trouble. When Alfonso Davies spins off you and there's space in behind, you have to cut that ball out, otherwise you're finished. You're not catching him at that moment, and he reads the line of the ball. You can criticise the pass to say, lift it, take it out, don't allow Kovadil to make that interception, but the space was there, they thought they could thread it between, and he really stepped across early and read the situation. Excellent play by Kovadil. He was getting challenged. He retained his balance. He stumbled a little bit, but the forward ball to Petkovic was always away from him, and Bojan was sliding away off his goal line. Good anticipation. So, Canada, looking for an equaliser after taking a very quick lead here in the Khalifa International Stadium. Goal officially timed at 67 seconds to make a change. That had still got 68 written down on my note pad in front of me. Out it goes now to Hoyler. On this right-hand side, but so many Croatian shirts. The red and white checkered shirts were back there, preventing him from going through, and it's been played back by Kone. Bojan comes out of his penalty area, his forward ball, Miller in the centre circle, and not really going anywhere at the moment. Miller decides to charge forward from defence, but they've given the ball away, and that now could mean problems, because Miller is so far forward. Kramaric turns back towards Moderic. Kramaric should then have made a run-off Hutchinson. He's still in mark now. Petkovic is offside. They have to be careful here, Croatia, as the ball goes out to Perishic on this near side, the left, still leading by two goals to one. He cuts inside. It's the cross, and this is an opportunity for Kramaric, and he's taken it. Brilliant touch from Kramaric, and the finish as well into the bottom left-hand corner was very, very neat. And now they have daylight, and Canada are facing elimination, because Croatia lead Canada by three goals to one, and what a fine goal it was too. You have to congratulate the quality of this goal. You really do. It's just a brilliant, brilliant finish from Kramaric. The build-up plays nice. The cross into the box, but his first touch is absolutely different class. It just sets up the whole chance. It's peeled off to the back post, and he receives the ball on his right foot, but it's almost like a half-volley controlled touch onto his left foot, and he then just guides it really cautiously, just controlled, and he might go through the legs of one of the players, but he knows exactly whereabouts he wants to feed that ball with his left foot, bends it into the far post. Absolutely no chance for Boyan in goal. He can get nowhere near it, but the first touch there, no. It's an absolute spot on, wasn't it? Yeah, certainly was. Former Leicester City player. What was it? 20 appearances and four goals at Leicester in the season of 15-16. They're looking for more goals here. It was a low crossing from the right-hand side from Kramaric. Kramaric was on the end of it. We've seen the quickest goal here tonight in this World Cup so far, and we were probably around centimetres away from him connecting, as he threw himself at it, but maybe even seen the first hat-trick at this World Cup. I mean, it'd be some performance if he did get that hat-trick. He's been very good, and like I've touched on before, I've really enjoyed seeing him in a wider area. He's got a good turn of pace, then, I know. He's very mobile, and I think he suits that ability to go wide and then arrive into the box. He's done very well. I don't think he's going to get his hat-trick, though, from what I can see. Well, first he's walking towards the touchline at the moment. Yeah, he is going to be coming off. Meanwhile, Canada have made a double change, and they've used all five substitutes now, because the equation for Canada in these 18 minutes that remain is that they've got to score two goals, and hopefully they don't concede any more. Otherwise, they're going out. So, Arakube has come on, and Cavalini has come on. Cavalini has replaced Jonathan David, so Lucas Cavalini of Vancouver Whitecaps replaces the Leal forward, and Hutchinson has gone off the Centurion for Canada, so he's been replaced by Atacube, and then the Croatia change was Nicola Vlasic has come on for Kramaric. He was a doubt with a calf problem, so former West Ham and Everton player who started the last game getting a run out for these closing 17 minutes of normal time, where Croatia are leading by three goals to one. I think what's interesting as well, when you look at the game as a whole and Canada's performance as well, is whether or not the physicality of the match in their first game, they gave everything, didn't they? They've looked a little bit flatter, a little bit lower energy in this match, haven't they? Especially in the second half, I think, you're playing against an experienced side of Croatia, who have been to the end levels time and time again in terms of tournament football and extra time and all the rest of it. Four years ago, their fitness was one of their key assets, wasn't there as a team, Croatia? They were brilliant. And that has shown in this match a little bit today. Well, you think that Belgian game, after 32 minutes, they've fired in 12 shots, they've finished with 22 shots at the Belgian goal. Only three were on target, mind, as the cross comes in for Canada. Alfonso Davies, Buchanan was there, didn't stick out a left leg, and in the end it was Livikovic, the goalkeeper, but the flag was up on this near side anyway, it wouldn't have counted, he was offside. But they just haven't been able to replicate that intensity. No, but it's hard if you can be in danger of punching yourself out, can't you? And I like you say, they threw a lot of punches in that first game, gave a lot, gave everything they had, and it showed in their performance, and it quite rightly got talked about in a very positive way. But repeating that time and time again, or into this game, so soon after, may well have been a slight factor in the end game result. Well, they have a quarter of an hour to try and produce a remarkable comeback. And it will certainly mean for a very, very tight group going into the final set of matches for the other three sides, because Canada will be out, but we will have Morocco and Croatia on four points, and Belgium on three, and the final set of matches on the 1st of December, on Thursday, Croatia against Belgium, and Canada against Morocco. So you can certainly see why it was important for Croatia to get three points out of this game here today. Corners been taken short on the left-hand side. You're listening to BBC Radio 5 Live. We've got Spain, Germany coming up at 7 o'clock. After this game, we'll be switching to Kelly Cates in the stadium, who sat alongside John Murray and Peter Schmeichel. And that is also on BBC Television, so you can listen and watch through World Cup Extra on the iPlayer, as you can for this game and for the entirety of that one. Ipswich-Buckston is currently on Sports Extra. It's the FA Cup's second round. There's been a goal. Aaron Paul. Ipswich won. Buckston, they're a really good goal from the league one side, who have controlled things here. Ian Westburn's played a ball across the edge of the deep, and there was Conor Chaplin to place an effort into the bottom left-hand corner of the net. Ipswich won. Buckston now. And Derby County have beaten Newport County by two goals to one. They came from behind there in South Wales, as here is Hoylert, former Cardiff player, shoots from distance, right footed, tracks it wide. So Derby County joined Burton Albion, Borenwood, who knocked out Bristol Robers by two goals to now, and Fleetwood in the third round draw tomorrow night. You can watch that on BBC Two at 7 o'clock. But this is day eight of the World Cup, and Canada will be eliminated like the host's cat-up if it stays like this. They have scored their first-ever goal, but they are yet to pick up a point in this their fifth match at a men's World Cup tournament. El Salvador holds the record of the longest sequence without a win. That was six, so that might well be equaled if Canada don't get the victory against Morocco next Thursday, but with 13 minutes remaining, you don't get the sense that they look like getting their way back into this contest, Matt Upson. It would be a massive turn-up, really, if they were to get back in this game. It really has been Croatians almost all the way from the opening 15 minutes of the game. They've just stamped their authority on this match, showed quality, showed control, energy at times. I'm looking at Kovacic now driving the ball forward from the middle of the park. He has been everywhere today. He has. He really has had a fine game. Perishic wants the game, doing the step-overs, almost goes to goal, comes out to Kovacic, and then Petkovic has the shot blocked by the goalkeeper Boyan. So close to a fourth goal. Should be four. I don't understand why Kovacic passed it, actually. Get it onto your right foot and hit it. It was really unselfish what he did. Now the counterattack, and it's played forward to Alfonso Davies. Keeps the ball in play, pulls it back, hoillets cross, headed out. Perishic looking towards Moderic. Canada try and get it back. The difference in quality in those situations we've just seen in the two, you can really tell, can't you? That final ball from Canada, that ability to get your head up and select the right pass. Croatia have done it every time they've been in positions. They've really executed their moves consistently throughout the game. Just haven't seen that same quality from Canada. 44,374 inside a stadium that holds just under 46,000. Here in Doha, and a lot of them will be disappointed because there are what, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, banks in the lower reaches over on that far side in this expansive Khalifa stadium where the red shirts, the Canadian supporters are housed, and just think they were maybe thinking what could have been after they took the lead, after a goal, after just 67 seconds. But Croatia have hit back. It makes you wonder what the Croatian media might do now with the Maple Leafs and John Hirdman on the front pages of the Croatian papers in the morning. I'd moved on from that, don't take me back to that dark place, picturing things I don't want to. Perichic was the player who was getting treatment. He looks like he's all right to continue. He got the assist again for the third goal. So he's taken his tally now to seven assists to add to his nine goals for the most involvement for a Croatian player during tournament football. Certainly you look at his record. He actually only needs one goal to move level with Manzukic. But two goals he scored at 2014 in the World Cup. He followed up with another two goals at Euro 2016, three in Russia. He was certainly pivotal as Croatia beat England in the semi-final. I remember in the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. And then another two goals at Euro 2020. So he has really been a key player down the years for Croatia. And it's proved to be tonight as they lead by three goals to one. Another goal in the FA Cup second round. Tired Portland Road, Aaron Paul. It's which two bucks, the nail cracking run from Cain Vincenjong. Down the left hand side is cross come shot. Fangasan Ahadme for his first in switch goal. And the tractor boys very much in control in this FA Cup tie. It's which two bucks the nail. Commentary of that is on Sports Extra. And a little later on tonight, a break from the World Cup, if you so wish. NFL coverage on Sports Extra at around nine o'clock. Arizona are at the LA Charges. Just think four years time. Could be in Los Angeles as well. Certainly the West Coast of America. Co-host with Canada and Mexico in 2026. A little bit more travelling than Qatar. Yeah. Slightly bigger area to cover. Yeah, bearing in mind that it's just the 46 miles between the eight stadiums here in Qatar. At the maximum travelling distance. Great vocal support from the Croatian fans. They've certainly put in plenty of travel. Whether it be Rayeka, Zagreb, Osiak, wherever they've come from that lovely country in Croatia. Very, very vocal. Away towards our left hand side. And their side are leading by three goals to one. Perishic shoots. Left footed, dragged it wide. Left footed edge of the area out for a goal kick. Eight minutes of normal time remaining. Certainly though, it's going to be a very exciting final set of matches next Thursday. It really is, isn't it? I mean, that Belgium-Croatia, it's going to be fascinating. It really is. I mean, Croatia taking this performance and result into that game to a Belgium team that's a little bit on the floor at the moment, I'd say, in terms of confidence and how they're feeling. Could really be an interesting match. Well, I'll tell you who else was on the floor. It was inside this stadium not that long ago. Germany, how will they respond against Spain? Because at the minute, you've got Japan on three points and Costa Rica on three points. After Costa Rica beat Japan by a goal to Nell earlier. Spain can qualify if they can beat Germany, but that would really put Germany up against it. It's a vital game. Peter Schmeichel and John Murray will be providing commentary alongside Kelly Cates. All the build-up to come from 7 o'clock and earlier, Belgium, Nell Morocco 2, was the scoreline in this group, which means that that's why it's going to be so tight going into those final matches next Thursday. Comprehensive coverage of the World Cup on five live, whether it be with Rick Edwinson, Rachel Burden at breakfast from six, or then with all the games live on the station and also through BBC Sounds. Hoylett out towards the far side, asking far too much of Asauria. I don't think the changes have helped Canada at all. It becomes too disjointed. Yeah, they're not too sure about the movements, the patterns, which I think they had nailed down in the first game. But I've been interestingly watching this little duel between Alfonso Davies and Gavaglio, who sent them back for Croatia. It's been really interesting seeing them two joust against each other. The change of direction. Davies keeps dropping short with the ball, spinning, trying to get turned, wants to face him up and beat him 1v1. Gavaglio showing really good mobility to try and deal with him. It's a good match-up. There's just been a yellow card shown to Modric and Camel Miller, the defender for Canada. The Uruguayan referee, certainly Miller seemed to take exception to something from Modric. There was quite a forceful push in the chest by Miller on Modric. But the referee has shown a yellow card to both players. As Croatia you sense, feel that the game is won because Dalic is going to make a triple change in these closing stages. Canada have the ball on this near side the right. Alfonso Davies waits. Back it goes then to Johnston. Johnston cross strikes the back of Perichic, kept in play by Johnston once again. And now it's with Vittoria. Every outfield player is in the Croatian half, but it's quite a high line from that Canadian at the Croatian backline. And now the changes will be made, which means we can get the team-years. From Spain to Germany, it's coming up on BBC Radio 5 Live at 7. And it'll be in the company of John Murray. Well, this is the group that's thrown up some surprises. Luis Enrique, for this one, suggested he would make changes after their 7-0 win in their opening match. But there's just the one, and that is Carvajal coming in for Aspelikweta at right back. Hansi Flick makes two changes as Germany look to get off the mark. And Schlauferts and Schlauferts make way for Guretska and Kera. Thank you, John. John joined by Piotr Schmeichel, Kali Keit presenting from the stadium. Modric has come off. Kovacic has been outstanding as come off. Perichic has also come off. And so the players who have come on, Maja for Kovacic, Orsic for Perichic, Pashalic has also come on to the field of play. So the triple change being made by Dalic. So Orsic, who scored the winning goal against Chelsea in the Champions League in the Maximus Stadium, hasn't necessarily replicated his club form on the international stage. So he is on. And we have about three and a half minutes remaining. But Kovacic, outstanding. Absolutely. I really think that he was so important in that early stage of the game. And they went one nil down. And it was a little bit open. The distances were too big. The midfield was a little bit vulnerable. But he's the one in there that's got the legs and the engine and the running power to deal with it. Ball was played through the middle towards Cavalini. Didn't really have the pace on it to try and find its way through to him in that inside left channel. Canada look very, very tired now. I mean, John Hirdman has done an exceptional job. He's taken them from 94th in the world when he took over to, they are now ranked 41st. They did ever so well in qualifying. They finished ahead of the United States. They finished ahead of Mexico in qualifying. They certainly created some iconic moments along the way. But they've fallen short in what has been a tough group. I mean, you can't underestimate what that nervous tension and energy brings, especially in that first game. I mean, look at the build-up. You've got a coach who's a key motivator, the way he manages. You've got an inspirational figure in the dressing room from your home country, who's the first person that's been on the moon. I'm sure you've got a massive lift out of them, which you saw in their performance. And it's like the replica in that is very difficult. And it's just been a little bit calmer this game, hasn't it? And from such a great start as well, brilliant opening in a few minutes or 10 minutes from Canada. And it's just slowly just kind of fallen away from them. Well, they created the chances against Belgium, but didn't have the quality. Tonight, they struggled to create clear openings after taking the lead after just 67 seconds. I mean, in the second half, they had those two from Osorio, and then the one from David was tipped over by Leverkovich. Can't really recall too much other than that. But they weren't real clear-cut goalscoring chances. They were half-chances, really, weren't they? But Croatia have shown their quality, particularly with Kramaric. And leading 3-1 with 60 seconds remaining. How much added on time is always of an interest in this world cup. Proved to be somewhat of a lottery predicting. And we're told there'll be six minutes from Gary Flint of our producer here, who's looked into his crystal ball. As we're yet to see the fourth official who hovers down below. But here is Petkovich, enters the penalty area, shot placed in from the substitute, Orsic, but it was a right-footed effort that was comfortably saved by Boyan. I mean, there's been so many attacks like that in this game, where Croatia have won the ball in and around the middle of the pitch, or even on the edge of their own box, and the way they've broken forwards, the link-up play, the first touch of the centre forward, or the player wide at the front three, they've just been so intelligent with the way they've laid the ball off, then popped the ball into space for an ongoing runner, whether that be a fallback or another midfield player. They've really have linked up well, it's been really well organised attack in play today from Croatia. Fourth official, then she's forward, and there it is. The bright red digit on the electronic board of six is shown to all sides of the Khalifa International Stadium, as Canada with Alfonso Davies. As he goes to the right-hand side to Alistair Johnson, puts in the cross, headed away by Lovren. They've had players in all departments who have excelled tonight, Croatia. Kavadiol at the back, Modric and Kovacic in the centre of midfield, and Kramaric up front. Yeah, I'd agree with that. I think you can pick those out and say they've been excellent. They're the players that have really driven this game, and the other players in the team, their levels have been good too. So it's been just an overall, from that first opening 10, 15 minutes, where they're not too good, they've really stepped up, and it's been a very well accomplished performance, shall we say, with some very good experienced players in the team. Cubiland Croatian supporters away towards our left-hand side. They're leading by three goals to one, we're in stoppage time. Spain against Germany is coming up, another key game. And Germany will be looking to bounce back after suffering back-to-back defeats in the World Cup for the first time since the end of the 78 World Cup, and then the start of 82. So they're going to have to draw on their years of tournament experience against Spain, who looked so impressive against Costa Rica the other night. And on this evidence for Croatia, you would fear for Belgium. They were back to that kind of Spain of nobody else can touch the ball, weren't they? The way they kept possession and how controlled they were was brilliant to watch. We have four minutes remaining of stoppage time. Alfonso Davies swings over the cross, headed away by Joranovic, fired back in by Hoilet, cleared by Croatia. Hoilet picks up that loose ball, in goes his ball, Guardiola again. He has been immense. Hoilet again with a dipping effort on the edge of the area right foot, he drops wide of the left-hand post, and out it goes for a goal kick, still 3-1 Croatian. Yeah, a bit of a flurry at the Croatian goal, all from outside the box. Junio Hoilet with the final one, right-footed volley that just kind of sat up, didn't hit it with any real conviction. But you're right, Deno, it's that man Guardiola again, wasn't it, with the stooping header, just to clear the Croatian box, and he has been immense today. Half-time in the FA Cup, second round. Ipswich Town are leading Buxton by two goals to nil, the second half will be on Sports Extra. Tomorrow's four games, and the coverage starts at 9 in the morning after five live breakfast with Rick and Rachel. Cameroon Serbia in Group G from 10, and it's Group H, South Korea Garner at one o'clock. The break-off is the cross from the left-hand side, Buchanan, Cavadial once more sweeps it to safety. Brazil, Switzerland at four, both sides of course won their opening game in Group G. Oh, as Croatia are away. Croatia on the counterattack, and it's unselfishly paid out towards the far side. Brilliant play by Orsic, and he just teed up Maier, who had the easiest of tasks to get a fourth goal in stoppage time. Croatia have led their football to the talking, and they have beaten Canada by four goals to one. Well, I'm not too sure what Miller's thinking, whether it's fatigue or tiredness, he comes across. The ball bounces in front of him, he doesn't deal with it. I think he tries to bring it under control as it bounces into him, but really makes a poor error, it goes through his legs, and then it's literally two Croatian players bearing down on goal. And like you said, really unselfish. I mean, the only thing Maier has to do is just make sure he stays onside, doesn't get ahead of the player. He does that well, and then just strokes the ball left-footed into the roof of the net. He'll have to eat his words. I would imagine that will be the message from Zlatko Dalic and the Croatian players across his court by Livokovic. They're classes told from Croatia. Yeah, certainly. Certainly has. There's no doubt in that. All goals, OK, that one's a mistake, but they've had other opportunities. The score line isn't harsh on Canada, really. It's probably just about right of the dominance of Croatia in this game. Lovre and Maier with his fourth goal for himself, scoring the fourth goal for Croatia on the night. They've seen that the 24-year-old Ren midfielder could be a long-term successor to Moderic, which is some boots to fill. But they've certainly filled their boots tonight with four goals, that is for sure in stoppage time. Croatia four, Canada one, and a rather dispirited Canadian team now just playing out the last couple of minutes. I mean, you did ask the question in the build-up of whether or not what he has said there is going to backfire. Yeah, it was... We had a couple of good questions, actually. I know what he was trying to do, but inadvertently, he poked the bear. They did. And they were irked, they were riled, and they've, as I say, they've let their football do in the talk. Another ball's just been given away. Croatia are looking for more goals here, and once again, it's all slid forward as Peckovic just couldn't get on the end of it behind. It goes for a corner kick. I mean, they're just hanging on now. Canada, they're sloppy mistakes over the pitch, and that is them done, I think. The Canadian players drop to their knees, and they're dropping out of the World Cup in Qatar. As Croatia go level at the top of Group F, four points apiece after a 4-1 win, and a quality performance from Croatia, bearing in mind that Canada, with their first ever goal in a men's World Cup, had taken the lead after just 67 seconds ahead of from Alfonso Davies. But after that, Croatia just were very, very good. Two goals from Grameric, Lvivaja, and then a goal in stoppage time from Maja, and they could have had more. Yeah, I mean, after a blistering start from Canada, couldn't have started better in many ways, but it was then Croatia that just went through the gears. Really good football, very controlled, very composed, measured play, and they were brutal at times with the way they kept the ball and the way they counter-attacked and tried to get overloads and worked the ball into situations. And with the players they have, they showed real finishing quality, and they'll be more than happy with the performance in this game today. And those who weren't on the score sheet, a special mention to Kovacic in the midfield, who was outstanding and Kvadiol, who was great at the back, certainly caught the eye. But it's finished here in the Khalifa International Stadium. Croatia 4, Canada 1, and now we cross to Kelly Cates, who'll be licking her lips in anticipation of Spain, Germany.
