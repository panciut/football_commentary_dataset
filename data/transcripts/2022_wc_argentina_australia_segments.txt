[0.00 - 3.60] P:1576.77 E:0.046654 |  But for 90 minutes says Australian manager Graham Arnold.
[3.60 - 5.40] P:1487.10 E:0.094864 |  It's 11 versus 11.
[5.40 - 8.36] P:1509.09 E:0.106030 |  It's 10 blue shirts against 10 yellow shirts.
[8.36 - 10.84] P:1643.43 E:0.100677 |  It's a battle and we've got to fight it.
[10.84 - 14.40] P:1643.55 E:0.100167 |  Pat Nevin, never a true word was spoken.
[14.40 - 16.60] P:1658.65 E:0.102423 |  Yeah, all the concern I've got.
[16.60 - 18.36] P:1454.20 E:0.102744 |  I went to bed and doha last night.
[18.36 - 20.20] P:1496.92 E:0.092203 |  I woke up and bowed in a series.
[20.20 - 23.36] P:1665.35 E:0.104195 |  This place is more with Argentinians.
[23.36 - 27.36] P:1384.16 E:0.105996 |  It is 90% Argentinians and everyone of them
[27.36 - 30.16] P:1608.08 E:0.101363 |  are making one strawberry noise.
[30.16 - 30.96] P:1578.07 E:0.111472 |  What an atmosphere.
[30.96 - 33.32] P:1632.00 E:0.107294 |  Best after the first talk-up in this world cup.
[33.32 - 35.16] P:1754.79 E:0.102568 |  My head is getting cold.
[35.16 - 37.52] P:1539.75 E:0.117358 |  Yes, there's a little patch of Australian fans
[37.52 - 39.60] P:1331.99 E:0.111960 |  in the lower tier away to our right.
[39.60 - 42.44] P:1605.73 E:0.106277 |  And it's almost like a little patch of sunshine
[42.44 - 47.60] P:1454.93 E:0.108572 |  is breaking through an enormous sky of blue and white
[47.60 - 50.96] P:1591.98 E:0.106605 |  just through the clouds of Argentina.
[50.96 - 54.76] P:1540.66 E:0.110390 |  As Australia get us underway, it's third in the world,
[54.76 - 56.60] P:1514.00 E:0.101171 |  against 38th in the world.
[56.64 - 61.36] P:1434.50 E:0.100912 |  It's the might of Missy against the ambition of Australia.
[61.36 - 64.24] P:1383.31 E:0.105746 |  And it's Australia coming forward down the right-hand side
[64.24 - 67.80] P:1537.04 E:0.101494 |  early on, playing in the golden shirts, the green shorts
[67.80 - 69.00] P:1539.08 E:0.103359 |  and the white socks.
[69.00 - 71.76] P:1600.64 E:0.110182 |  Argentina in the blue and white stripes,
[71.76 - 74.36] P:1471.39 E:0.102363 |  the black shorts and the black socks.
[74.36 - 76.56] P:1489.95 E:0.119898 |  And it's Australia who started brightly
[76.56 - 81.16] P:1300.11 E:0.103961 |  just like that little patch of Australia fans down to our right.
[81.16 - 84.12] P:1335.78 E:0.108673 |  And Pat Nevin, the start for Australia.
[84.12 - 85.76] P:1289.16 E:0.102190 |  But it's not just the start.
[85.80 - 88.88] P:1403.27 E:0.098351 |  The whole way that they dictate the energy
[88.88 - 91.72] P:1554.19 E:0.097407 |  that they defend with is going to be so key.
[91.72 - 94.28] P:1335.75 E:0.093224 |  And that throw on the far side is broken down.
[94.28 - 97.00] P:1578.03 E:0.096994 |  Argentina will pick it up and play it back to the edge
[97.00 - 98.24] P:1483.49 E:0.110906 |  of their own penalty area.
[98.24 - 100.84] P:1618.61 E:0.098707 |  But work Australia to get off to a bad start,
[100.84 - 103.20] P:1532.51 E:0.107550 |  which they didn't do when they beat Tunisia,
[103.20 - 106.36] P:1528.64 E:0.098917 |  which they didn't do when they beat Denmark.
[106.36 - 107.20] P:1689.75 E:0.116694 |  Well done.
[107.20 - 110.00] P:1716.72 E:0.107838 |  Yeah, I mean, the practice started in front of them.
[110.00 - 112.72] P:1618.79 E:0.102422 |  Very noticeably, Jackson Irvine,
[112.72 - 114.96] P:1514.65 E:0.111009 |  he actually started the game against Denmark.
[114.96 - 118.48] P:1507.48 E:0.102847 |  A little bit deeper, pushed off forward to almost a 10 position.
[118.48 - 121.40] P:1638.40 E:0.109960 |  It's ultra positive, really, from the Australian start
[121.40 - 122.40] P:1721.29 E:0.082591 |  of this game.
[122.40 - 126.32] P:1518.20 E:0.097773 |  Maybe slightly surprising, but, you know, it might be off,
[126.32 - 127.92] P:1403.24 E:0.092558 |  you never know.
[127.92 - 128.92] P:1456.67 E:0.089265 |  But I like the action.
[130.60 - 133.88] P:1972.60 E:0.121382 |  Argentina with the throw on the sneer side
[133.88 - 134.88] P:1936.67 E:0.108949 |  on the halfway line.
[134.88 - 136.40] P:1798.66 E:0.093484 |  And we can take them through the team.
[136.40 - 138.72] P:1353.14 E:0.119541 |  Big team news for Argentina, as well as
[138.72 - 142.36] P:1506.77 E:0.105692 |  mentally making that 1,000th appearance of his career
[142.36 - 144.92] P:1553.67 E:0.106584 |  for the country is no ankle D Maria.
[144.92 - 146.56] P:1417.02 E:0.097221 |  Now, he was a doubt for this one.
[146.56 - 149.36] P:1224.53 E:0.107705 |  He's officially on the team sheet, but he's not warmed up.
[149.36 - 150.48] P:1523.13 E:0.095104 |  He's not got his boots on.
[150.48 - 152.20] P:1522.92 E:0.109479 |  And as Pat said a little bit earlier,
[152.20 - 154.56] P:1347.81 E:0.095845 |  if he does play any parts tonight,
[154.56 - 157.08] P:1449.75 E:0.091130 |  it'll be one of the biggest cons in the World Cup.
[157.08 - 162.44] P:1547.82 E:0.101263 |  So no D Maria is replaced by Alejandro Papugomas
[162.44 - 163.36] P:1181.90 E:0.099532 |  in their one change.
[163.36 - 167.40] P:1580.48 E:0.093619 |  And as Argentina play it around at the back, Australia,
[167.40 - 169.00] P:1279.75 E:0.103901 |  just try and block it out for the throw.
[169.00 - 170.44] P:1263.79 E:0.108040 |  Argentina still have it.
[170.44 - 173.52] P:1484.94 E:0.106490 |  It's sent forward to Alexis McAllister, a Brighton.
[173.52 - 176.92] P:1630.96 E:0.098561 |  Now in field to Rodrigo de Paul.
[176.92 - 180.00] P:1457.06 E:0.110104 |  Argentina will pick it up on this right hand side.
[180.00 - 183.24] P:1385.77 E:0.101908 |  So, Emi Martinez of Aston Villa in goal.
[183.24 - 185.72] P:1338.98 E:0.106336 |  The back court of Molina, Romero, a Tottenham,
[185.72 - 187.88] P:1269.69 E:0.093699 |  Ottenmendi, the former Manchester City defender,
[187.88 - 188.88] P:1606.00 E:0.091566 |  and Acuña.
[188.88 - 191.12] P:1516.62 E:0.092240 |  Ahead of them, it's de Paul, Fernandez,
[191.12 - 194.88] P:1284.88 E:0.096308 |  and Brighton to Calister with Gomez.
[194.88 - 197.28] P:1502.09 E:0.093361 |  Alvarez of Manchester City,
[197.28 - 198.92] P:1323.63 E:0.105021 |  and the Enormesci up front.
[198.92 - 201.60] P:1268.94 E:0.111252 |  Argentina still just inside the Australia half,
[201.60 - 204.24] P:1488.64 E:0.100681 |  looking around very patiently.
[204.24 - 209.80] P:1449.35 E:0.111358 |  So, Australia coming back now into this forward ball, too,
[209.80 - 213.00] P:1603.18 E:0.106849 |  which we do expect, but it's Jackson Irvine pushing up.
[213.00 - 215.56] P:1539.14 E:0.098390 |  So, Keanu Bakus, who is there one change,
[215.56 - 216.48] P:1380.54 E:0.093886 |  coming in for Craig Goodwin,
[216.48 - 217.84] P:1594.77 E:0.095880 |  has started in central midfield.
[217.84 - 219.76] P:1592.57 E:0.101253 |  So, your back court,
[219.76 - 221.64] P:1580.65 E:0.093099 |  the back five for Australia as you'd expect.
[221.64 - 223.80] P:1342.18 E:0.101882 |  So, Ryan in goal, the back court of Degenex Souter,
[223.80 - 225.32] P:1359.78 E:0.082558 |  who's been brilliant this tournament,
[225.32 - 227.24] P:1451.73 E:0.088864 |  Brawls and Behet.
[227.24 - 229.20] P:1378.64 E:0.107853 |  And then, ahead of them, you've got Moe and Bakus
[229.20 - 230.32] P:1181.80 E:0.089218 |  in the centre at the moment.
[230.32 - 232.32] P:1244.15 E:0.104335 |  Riley Mcgrie over on this left-hand side.
[232.32 - 235.44] P:1289.85 E:0.091786 |  Matthew Leckey, who is their hero against Denmark,
[235.44 - 236.28] P:1150.91 E:0.120502 |  on the wide right.
[236.28 - 238.64] P:1434.16 E:0.094304 |  And Jackson Irvine pushing right up front,
[238.64 - 240.20] P:1506.93 E:0.113763 |  alongside Mitchell Choupe and Argentina
[240.20 - 241.60] P:1355.11 E:0.099613 |  are still inside their own line.
[241.60 - 244.96] P:1589.60 E:0.097465 |  I mean, I'm quite surprised by that.
[244.96 - 247.44] P:1644.54 E:0.101841 |  It is 4-4-2, sometimes Jackson and Arvain's come back,
[247.44 - 249.60] P:1517.07 E:0.090294 |  but he's the player he's allowed to move forward.
[249.60 - 251.44] P:1794.27 E:0.109745 |  There is a problem with 4-4-2,
[251.44 - 253.60] P:1571.51 E:0.095321 |  and I'm very explained to you in one moment.
[253.60 - 255.56] P:1601.70 E:0.115647 |  As Argentina comes down the left-hand side,
[255.56 - 258.96] P:1735.05 E:0.104170 |  a big appeal for Hanball, right on the edge of the penalty area.
[258.96 - 260.88] P:1864.36 E:0.109692 |  Nothing doing from our Polish referee,
[260.88 - 262.96] P:1984.06 E:0.085359 |  Simon Marciniak.
[262.96 - 266.28] P:1784.34 E:0.106975 |  And Australia will clear up towards the Argentina penalty area.
[266.28 - 268.88] P:1814.77 E:0.099628 |  No golden shirt there to really put the pressure on.
[268.88 - 271.36] P:1807.19 E:0.106847 |  I mean, Martinez will play it out from the back, will he?
[271.36 - 274.40] P:1954.75 E:0.109460 |  Generally, the problem with 4-4-2 is
[274.40 - 276.52] P:2029.63 E:0.116471 |  it's got space between the lines.
[276.52 - 281.12] P:2065.88 E:0.118444 |  The basic lines and no half position players.
[281.12 - 283.08] P:2053.96 E:0.120087 |  We have in this game, where it's very much right,
[283.08 - 286.00] P:2035.56 E:0.100901 |  the best half position players on this planet.
[286.00 - 288.52] P:1840.91 E:0.099478 |  We must be looking at it and thinking, oh, goody.
[288.52 - 292.36] P:1791.46 E:0.093864 |  You know, and I'm actually not surprised, really,
[292.36 - 293.80] P:1538.56 E:0.096888 |  because you know the Aussies are like,
[293.80 - 297.00] P:1677.12 E:0.086847 |  they'll do what suits them and what's right for them.
[297.00 - 300.68] P:1862.53 E:0.101976 |  But to go against Argentina with Messi playing
[300.68 - 304.12] P:1980.20 E:0.105951 |  in a direct 4-4-2, it's brave.
[304.12 - 305.32] P:1867.11 E:0.107258 |  It's really brave.
[305.32 - 308.48] P:1778.74 E:0.092149 |  Hey, but you don't win things unless you're brave, do you?
[308.48 - 311.80] P:1356.01 E:0.107097 |  And that's certainly the approach that Graham Arnold often talks up,
[311.84 - 314.04] P:1506.77 E:0.085489 |  and then it's what actually happens on the pitch,
[314.04 - 318.92] P:1413.59 E:0.089115 |  because defensively, their defence has been such a strength
[318.92 - 320.20] P:1426.39 E:0.104546 |  at the last two games.
[320.20 - 322.32] P:1520.15 E:0.092514 |  When they were thumped 4-1 by France, Australia,
[322.32 - 324.44] P:1388.09 E:0.084635 |  as they played over the halfway line,
[324.44 - 326.76] P:1575.23 E:0.098913 |  I think we all wondered how that would fare.
[326.76 - 329.40] P:1685.92 E:0.104307 |  But clean sheets back to back for the first time
[329.40 - 331.44] P:1822.46 E:0.102461 |  at a World Cup against Tunisia and Denmark
[331.44 - 334.04] P:1892.89 E:0.098999 |  have seen them through to this last 16 match,
[334.04 - 337.04] P:1801.21 E:0.102673 |  because Argentina win a free kick just inside their own half
[337.04 - 338.52] P:1503.95 E:0.104500 |  on the edge of the centre-circle.
[338.52 - 342.24] P:1583.75 E:0.102051 |  You heard earlier around us the huge noise
[342.24 - 344.56] P:1448.12 E:0.091395 |  inside the Atme Van Alley Stadium.
[344.56 - 347.08] P:1617.37 E:0.112488 |  The Argentinian fans, I love it, Pat, they can cheer
[347.08 - 348.48] P:1480.12 E:0.095838 |  because they're not happy that their team
[348.48 - 349.76] P:1511.16 E:0.093429 |  is still inside their own half,
[349.76 - 351.44] P:1563.42 E:0.111154 |  but they can also keep singing
[351.44 - 354.64] P:1433.08 E:0.088775 |  and punching their fists in the air as well.
[354.64 - 357.16] P:1452.87 E:0.090817 |  The support is there, but also the slight impatience.
[357.16 - 360.08] P:1640.76 E:0.090505 |  Yeah, there's not that many fan groups in the world.
[360.08 - 362.36] P:1672.57 E:0.094289 |  The general keeps on going for 90 minutes.
[362.36 - 365.56] P:1727.60 E:0.092256 |  It doesn't actually stop, it changes and it adapts.
[365.56 - 367.88] P:1724.09 E:0.109900 |  And the following goes up, it goes down.
[367.92 - 369.68] P:1880.19 E:0.088341 |  The emotions change as well.
[369.68 - 373.00] P:1851.69 E:0.100144 |  It never really stops, does it, with the Argentinian supporters.
[373.00 - 378.04] P:1764.23 E:0.090410 |  We'll see if it stops if the studio do surprises on and score a goal.
[378.04 - 381.84] P:1648.23 E:0.103978 |  So, Argentina again, I think the best-word group is patient so far,
[381.84 - 384.24] P:1321.68 E:0.091943 |  happy to knock the ball around inside their own half.
[384.24 - 388.44] P:1587.63 E:0.089625 |  But Australia, becoming a little encouraged as Jackson Irvine
[388.44 - 390.44] P:1611.70 E:0.102196 |  just drifts into the penalty area.
[390.44 - 393.44] P:1304.91 E:0.087034 |  Ami Martinez will send it out to the left-hand side
[393.44 - 395.24] P:1374.61 E:0.082354 |  and Irvine will retreat,
[395.24 - 398.16] P:1427.60 E:0.097025 |  and Argentina working out to the left-hand side.
[398.16 - 400.16] P:1675.45 E:0.095316 |  Behicce is there under pressure.
[400.16 - 402.56] P:1744.07 E:0.089368 |  The Australia right back in back,
[402.56 - 404.28] P:1789.56 E:0.107334 |  he's digging over on that far side,
[404.28 - 407.68] P:1667.28 E:0.088264 |  just clears the ball out of play for an Argentinian crowd.
[407.68 - 409.36] P:1500.22 E:0.112865 |  Do you know who's seen Messi in person?
[409.36 - 412.52] P:1498.79 E:0.098829 |  I'm fortunate to see him quite a few times over the years.
[412.52 - 414.28] P:1720.62 E:0.098271 |  And his games changed a lot.
[414.28 - 418.36] P:1583.90 E:0.093565 |  He walks more than any other player you will ever see.
[418.36 - 421.92] P:1566.10 E:0.100866 |  He just walks and his head swivels and he looks and he's looking for space.
[421.96 - 424.20] P:1574.26 E:0.101295 |  He's just looking to where the opposition are,
[424.20 - 426.20] P:1708.77 E:0.076322 |  how the game's developing.
[426.20 - 428.80] P:1574.19 E:0.102443 |  It's incredible, because any other player would do that,
[428.80 - 431.88] P:1664.62 E:0.089874 |  and you'd shoot and ball and he'd get moving and that would seem...
[431.88 - 435.04] P:1585.29 E:0.089421 |  But he just looks for the angles and looks for the space.
[435.04 - 439.60] P:1630.16 E:0.085065 |  And at the moment, he's not finding much, but he will at some point.
[439.60 - 442.20] P:1554.79 E:0.093337 |  Nil Nil, six and a half minutes gone.
[442.20 - 444.52] P:1635.70 E:0.103565 |  And a reminder that you can watch this match
[444.52 - 446.80] P:1495.16 E:0.096768 |  via the BBC iPlayer with our commentary
[446.80 - 451.20] P:1793.04 E:0.101909 |  just search for World Cup Extra as Argentina
[451.48 - 454.32] P:1963.87 E:0.112324 |  and a free kick just inside the Australia half.
[454.32 - 456.28] P:1994.50 E:0.104527 |  And they're asking the question
[456.28 - 459.72] P:1696.31 E:0.097264 |  whether that should be a little bit more than just the set piece
[459.72 - 461.92] P:1267.28 E:0.090478 |  for the foul on Nil Messi.
[461.92 - 464.28] P:1470.36 E:0.083621 |  By backers are coming together, perhaps, huh?
[464.28 - 467.12] P:1643.21 E:0.107763 |  Right, well, you knew what he was doing.
[467.12 - 468.88] P:1749.66 E:0.099796 |  You made the tackle, he's left it,
[468.88 - 473.60] P:1615.22 E:0.087311 |  but his shoulder forward through to make sure that Messi knew he was here.
[473.60 - 475.88] P:1598.69 E:0.104457 |  And I think he was looking through, Messi's shot there.
[475.88 - 478.36] P:1858.47 E:0.092861 |  They were hearing about that earlier.
[478.48 - 481.40] P:1719.04 E:0.090947 |  Don't play the shirt, don't play the player.
[481.40 - 485.60] P:1631.89 E:0.102903 |  Just play the game, 11-v-11, that's the strong message from Graham Arnold
[485.60 - 488.12] P:1641.29 E:0.099787 |  as the ball goes out of play for an Australian throw,
[488.12 - 491.60] P:1656.95 E:0.095557 |  which beheads the callback we'll take from this net and side.
[491.60 - 494.52] P:1579.95 E:0.086358 |  But it's a message that is something,
[494.52 - 496.60] P:1389.49 E:0.095847 |  that is not just because they're playing Argentina.
[496.60 - 500.00] P:1590.44 E:0.096104 |  They've got out of a group Australia containing France and Denmark.
[500.00 - 502.28] P:1602.57 E:0.071310 |  They've finished runners up to France.
[502.28 - 505.64] P:1398.29 E:0.096357 |  And that's the message that's been ingrained in them for so long
[506.40 - 508.72] P:1094.37 E:0.073860 |  as Argentina have it on the half-way line.
[508.72 - 512.56] P:1566.30 E:0.100335 |  It's a no-nonsense attitude you do get from a number of Aussie coaches,
[512.56 - 514.52] P:1749.84 E:0.088564 |  I mentioned, Ants Pusk the Cogglute,
[514.52 - 516.60] P:1639.97 E:0.101917 |  did the same when he was the Aussie manager,
[516.60 - 520.24] P:1678.58 E:0.090010 |  and done the same with everyone he's ever worked with before.
[520.24 - 522.52] P:1599.47 E:0.090599 |  But there is one thing that's interesting,
[522.52 - 525.32] P:1570.70 E:0.087523 |  we're early into the game, just about eight minutes.
[525.32 - 527.52] P:1713.93 E:0.098016 |  That was what hasn't happened yet, has it?
[527.52 - 530.04] P:1716.43 E:0.105030 |  So I think the Aussies will be delighted with that,
[530.04 - 532.80] P:1763.49 E:0.106975 |  that they've not been putting a massive pressure right away.
[532.92 - 536.72] P:1720.82 E:0.091723 |  And the world that you've used so far with the Argentinians is correct.
[536.72 - 537.72] P:1497.60 E:0.060445 |  Patience.
[539.32 - 543.08] P:1413.54 E:0.099538 |  Patience requires, over on the half-way line, from Papugomes,
[543.08 - 545.56] P:1100.99 E:0.085254 |  he does send the ball over the top down, the left-hand side,
[545.56 - 549.96] P:1375.26 E:0.098837 |  as Argentina looked to build on small, they send it in field to Rodrigo de Paul,
[549.96 - 553.84] P:1610.39 E:0.091758 |  and now out to this right-hand side with Noel Molina,
[553.84 - 557.32] P:1352.53 E:0.092957 |  back in field to Inzo Fernandes.
[557.32 - 560.12] P:1272.40 E:0.100241 |  Very tight, very congested, nil-nil.
[560.12 - 562.04] P:1252.32 E:0.090402 |  Here on five-live with BBC Sounds,
[562.04 - 565.44] P:1388.49 E:0.105492 |  as the ball is played out once more in the gold shirts of Australia,
[565.44 - 567.56] P:1560.64 E:0.074316 |  just dropping back a little.
[567.56 - 569.76] P:1378.39 E:0.100711 |  The shape's been good this tournament,
[569.76 - 572.60] P:1646.60 E:0.091997 |  and have to be good this evening.
[572.60 - 574.44] P:1537.82 E:0.101875 |  So far, they're closing down the spaces,
[574.44 - 576.80] P:1631.73 E:0.110727 |  although nicely turned by McCannister,
[576.80 - 578.76] P:1763.55 E:0.102702 |  away from Kearney-Bacchus,
[578.76 - 581.12] P:1815.39 E:0.109406 |  and belatedly the free kick is given.
[582.12 - 583.56] P:1722.01 E:0.118322 |  There probably was a free kick there,
[583.56 - 585.92] P:1847.45 E:0.101335 |  taking it from the wrong place, they'll have to bring it back.
[585.92 - 588.00] P:1817.82 E:0.112257 |  The Aussies know this is going to happen.
[588.96 - 590.44] P:1904.50 E:0.113337 |  They've played a lot about further up the field,
[590.44 - 591.92] P:1790.65 E:0.108615 |  but slowly, bit surely,
[591.92 - 594.88] P:1538.52 E:0.089131 |  over the last few minutes they've got further and further and back,
[594.88 - 596.84] P:1597.13 E:0.092838 |  more and more players behind the ball.
[596.84 - 600.60] P:1510.60 E:0.098106 |  So, defending to deep Australia with Deggeneck down the right-hand side,
[600.60 - 603.44] P:1753.30 E:0.089502 |  little missed control from Messi,
[603.44 - 604.72] P:1417.78 E:0.097031 |  outside the penalty area,
[604.72 - 607.04] P:1593.57 E:0.093949 |  and Australia will try and counter it's well intercepted,
[607.04 - 610.48] P:1520.27 E:0.085969 |  though by Argentina, and picked up by Alexis McCallister.
[610.48 - 612.40] P:1584.19 E:0.107286 |  He scored his first goal for his country,
[612.40 - 613.88] P:1622.07 E:0.099642 |  the Brighton man in the last match,
[613.88 - 617.60] P:1510.63 E:0.106241 |  and here is Julian Alvarez trying to bring the Alvarez down,
[617.60 - 618.84] P:1684.41 E:0.117262 |  inside the penalty area,
[618.84 - 621.48] P:1768.68 E:0.106741 |  but can't control in front of the Australia fans,
[621.48 - 624.28] P:1634.57 E:0.096524 |  and Pat Weir, high up in the stands here,
[624.28 - 625.96] P:1563.53 E:0.100195 |  not sure I can hear what they're singing,
[625.96 - 627.28] P:1581.39 E:0.081605 |  but I think I can guess.
[627.28 - 628.80] P:1434.19 E:0.110252 |  Yeah, now people are delighted as well,
[628.80 - 631.12] P:1641.02 E:0.095017 |  because even if it goes out for a goal kick,
[631.12 - 632.92] P:1602.61 E:0.100287 |  first little bit of meaningful pressure
[632.92 - 635.64] P:1646.10 E:0.103255 |  that Argentina have been able to put on them,
[635.64 - 637.64] P:1223.31 E:0.103511 |  has had no great effect.
[637.64 - 639.40] P:1488.36 E:0.096656 |  So that's the calmness.
[639.40 - 641.64] P:1592.51 E:0.101637 |  What helped that is, if you're in Australia,
[641.64 - 643.36] P:1416.59 E:0.093140 |  one massive help that is,
[643.36 - 645.84] P:1352.51 E:0.105140 |  you were expecting your Messi to be going on the ball,
[645.88 - 648.04] P:1629.28 E:0.087338 |  players to be running for you from right and left,
[648.04 - 649.28] P:1375.09 E:0.088180 |  zipping the ball about.
[649.28 - 650.60] P:1537.27 E:0.095671 |  It's not quite happening like that yet,
[650.60 - 653.44] P:1805.99 E:0.089302 |  and it's giving them time to really calmly
[653.44 - 655.60] P:1596.98 E:0.066846 |  get a foot holding the game.
[655.60 - 656.92] P:1613.66 E:0.112468 |  Australia in possession,
[656.92 - 658.60] P:1662.18 E:0.095056 |  midway through their own half with Harry Souter.
[658.60 - 662.08] P:1468.71 E:0.088033 |  Is this start then down to Argentina, or down to Australia?
[662.08 - 665.52] P:1574.69 E:0.096396 |  I bet both. I would say it was actually both of them,
[665.52 - 666.76] P:1727.21 E:0.099368 |  because Smit do it.
[666.76 - 669.44] P:1657.43 E:0.107563 |  Argentina want to play 100m, and a lot of teams like to do that.
[669.44 - 671.20] P:1621.59 E:0.103079 |  I don't think they like to do that.
[671.20 - 672.88] P:1470.83 E:0.121722 |  All down the right-hand side,
[672.88 - 674.84] P:1668.04 E:0.115585 |  it was a very good one for Lecky.
[674.84 - 676.84] P:1703.46 E:0.115736 |  Can't bring it under his spell.
[676.84 - 681.16] P:1405.26 E:0.118494 |  The Australian man who's been involved in two of their three goals
[681.16 - 682.92] P:1359.21 E:0.080468 |  at this World Cup.
[682.92 - 684.60] P:1185.67 E:0.094946 |  One goal and one assist.
[684.60 - 687.24] P:1554.91 E:0.086486 |  The crucial goal against Denmark in their last match.
[687.24 - 691.16] P:1532.23 E:0.101323 |  Denmark desperately disappointing the European semi-finalists
[691.16 - 694.36] P:1352.69 E:0.079367 |  in this tournament, going out in the group stages.
[694.36 - 697.24] P:1632.54 E:0.115858 |  It's Merson Turnes, still inside his own half,
[697.24 - 699.40] P:1647.55 E:0.088857 |  but you can hear the appreciation
[699.40 - 701.08] P:1103.01 E:0.083540 |  from the Argentina fans around us.
[701.08 - 704.12] P:1422.24 E:0.093660 |  Nil-nil, 11 minutes played as the ball is drifted out
[704.20 - 705.24] P:1656.24 E:0.108582 |  to the right-hand side.
[705.24 - 707.16] P:1711.06 E:0.103640 |  It won't be kept in by Molina.
[707.16 - 710.36] P:1732.63 E:0.096345 |  So, let his heads back to the studio,
[710.36 - 713.32] P:1445.06 E:0.106186 |  and bring in Aussie legend, Mila Yedinak.
[713.32 - 714.76] P:1290.00 E:0.070844 |  Mila.
[714.76 - 717.72] P:1227.61 E:0.099222 |  Yeah, listen, obviously a good start from Australia,
[717.72 - 719.40] P:1377.92 E:0.112993 |  keeping Argentina at bay.
[719.40 - 721.72] P:1229.46 E:0.090187 |  We'd love to see a little bit more pressure,
[721.72 - 723.56] P:1361.99 E:0.106432 |  just when that ball goes into that middle third,
[723.56 - 725.00] P:1414.69 E:0.086501 |  but so far it's been okay.
[727.24 - 730.20] P:1288.34 E:0.100293 |  Australia in possession over on that right-hand side.
[730.20 - 732.28] P:1524.52 E:0.085605 |  Nil-nil against Argentina.
[732.28 - 735.24] P:1339.83 E:0.092789 |  Australia looking to reach the quarter-finals
[735.24 - 737.00] P:1343.22 E:0.081878 |  for the first time in their history.
[737.00 - 739.24] P:1432.34 E:0.096124 |  They've only reached this stage once before.
[739.88 - 744.92] P:1642.34 E:0.093670 |  That was back in 2006, and they lost to Italy.
[746.04 - 748.04] P:1537.61 E:0.115088 |  Argentina come down the right-hand side,
[748.04 - 751.64] P:1720.91 E:0.105825 |  nice and controlled by Alvarez of Manchester City.
[751.64 - 753.32] P:1462.94 E:0.102865 |  Gets it back from Rodrigo de Paul,
[753.32 - 756.12] P:1559.03 E:0.105772 |  and Alvarez driving through that Aussie midfield,
[756.12 - 759.08] P:1651.48 E:0.092008 |  carving through it like a knife through butter.
[759.08 - 760.60] P:1753.71 E:0.114281 |  The Golden Shirts eventually,
[760.60 - 762.36] P:1674.61 E:0.110388 |  he managed to get it away with Beich,
[763.08 - 765.08] P:1746.40 E:0.103854 |  but will go out for an Argentina throw.
[765.08 - 766.84] P:1715.48 E:0.094391 |  I mentioned Beich before,
[766.84 - 769.08] P:1576.62 E:0.097655 |  and his first piece of defending he's had to do,
[769.08 - 770.92] P:1513.36 E:0.086165 |  and it was exceptional,
[770.92 - 772.04] P:1536.77 E:0.116783 |  but a really good job there.
[772.04 - 774.44] P:1544.00 E:0.102248 |  But we ask a lot more questions as this game goes on,
[774.44 - 777.48] P:1611.45 E:0.102455 |  and I've noticed Messi starting hanging about out here
[777.48 - 778.76] P:1777.27 E:0.101679 |  in this right-hand side,
[778.76 - 782.04] P:1630.14 E:0.109321 |  which is kind of where I expected him to start hanging about,
[782.04 - 784.28] P:1644.25 E:0.093738 |  because he's spotted the weakness
[784.28 - 785.72] P:1647.62 E:0.104519 |  in the early part of the Danish game.
[786.92 - 789.72] P:1300.88 E:0.101941 |  Argentina in possession in the centre circle,
[789.80 - 792.20] P:1332.58 E:0.100166 |  the winners of this match will face the Netherlands
[792.84 - 793.96] P:1172.22 E:0.096861 |  in the quarterfinals.
[793.96 - 795.96] P:1344.94 E:0.101877 |  That's after the Netherlands beat USA.
[796.52 - 801.08] P:1131.25 E:0.091153 |  My three goals to one earlier tomorrow on Five Life.
[802.68 - 806.44] P:1576.67 E:0.102836 |  Do join us for the huge match that is England
[806.44 - 809.24] P:1358.77 E:0.082524 |  against Senegal's 7 o'clock coverage.
[809.80 - 811.64] P:1675.99 E:0.096224 |  commentary will start coverage,
[811.64 - 813.96] P:1624.59 E:0.086825 |  and build-up starts way before that.
[813.96 - 816.12] P:1432.72 E:0.079517 |  6am on Five Life Breakfast,
[816.12 - 817.64] P:1533.79 E:0.080943 |  and before that you can join us for commentary
[817.64 - 818.84] P:1605.25 E:0.089483 |  of France against Poland.
[819.56 - 822.04] P:1607.60 E:0.091511 |  As well as Australia in position,
[822.04 - 824.28] P:1687.44 E:0.075630 |  just outside their own penalty area.
[824.28 - 826.52] P:1772.87 E:0.096151 |  The two defenders look really good in the centre-back position,
[826.52 - 826.84] P:1359.91 E:0.104120 |  don't they?
[826.84 - 828.36] P:1791.69 E:0.092388 |  I mean, we all know that Souter
[828.36 - 831.32] P:1814.65 E:0.099618 |  has basically had a cracker of a World Cup so far.
[832.20 - 833.80] P:1739.97 E:0.109442 |  And I know it's really confident there,
[833.80 - 834.68] P:1785.76 E:0.101275 |  Wells beside him.
[835.40 - 837.64] P:1774.67 E:0.116071 |  As a duo, they look really, really good,
[837.64 - 839.08] P:1869.28 E:0.095878 |  and they're getting good protection.
[839.08 - 841.96] P:1784.23 E:0.105121 |  Reign Frunnden from Aaron Moyhu
[841.96 - 844.52] P:1820.73 E:0.104412 |  is already put in four or five very good tackles.
[844.52 - 845.96] P:1711.98 E:0.110330 |  Think most of them well,
[845.96 - 847.64] P:1727.77 E:0.107105 |  and those Argentinian midfielders,
[847.64 - 849.24] P:1669.83 E:0.102768 |  forward, no other end again.
[849.88 - 852.12] P:1478.13 E:0.110996 |  Argentina in possession as their fans
[852.76 - 855.40] P:1427.88 E:0.107072 |  raise the noise once more inside the stadium.
[855.40 - 857.88] P:1604.91 E:0.098862 |  You're right, Pat, it is like being in Buenos Aires.
[857.88 - 861.56] P:1499.37 E:0.095984 |  This is very much a home match for Argentina.
[861.56 - 862.44] P:1492.70 E:0.092307 |  That's what it feels like.
[862.44 - 863.88] P:1544.05 E:0.100489 |  But, Demok had to deal with that...
[864.84 - 866.52] P:1575.54 E:0.105377 |  Australia, I should say, had to deal with that.
[866.52 - 868.36] P:1284.89 E:0.096323 |  Demok did as well, but we're watching Australia.
[868.36 - 870.68] P:1575.28 E:0.102594 |  Australia had to deal with that when they faced Tunisia.
[871.88 - 873.72] P:1612.33 E:0.112250 |  Yeah, I mean, that is really special.
[873.72 - 876.36] P:1608.23 E:0.085804 |  One of the things you see is trying quite in the crowd.
[876.36 - 878.04] P:1694.55 E:0.105825 |  Yeah, right, as he's just said,
[878.04 - 880.20] P:1503.77 E:0.093239 |  been done the best lot, but at the moment,
[880.20 - 883.88] P:1700.22 E:0.098214 |  you know, there's not been any real chances, in fact, this night.
[883.88 - 885.96] P:1844.48 E:0.108554 |  It's been a half chance for Argentina,
[886.68 - 888.12] P:1823.14 E:0.121937 |  you know, just as they say that,
[888.12 - 889.40] P:1619.36 E:0.116987 |  the Argentinians have decided,
[889.40 - 891.40] P:1567.34 E:0.111448 |  let's liven things up a little bit.
[892.36 - 893.16] P:1851.27 E:0.125429 |  It's that bouncy.
[893.88 - 895.96] P:1692.15 E:0.104621 |  But their side have given the ball away
[895.96 - 897.00] P:1613.81 E:0.091395 |  inside their own half,
[897.00 - 899.40] P:1636.36 E:0.102807 |  and Matthew Lecky's bringing it down the right for Australia.
[899.40 - 903.88] P:1560.64 E:0.107745 |  Good foot in, though, and Argentina take a tumble on the fast side,
[904.52 - 908.44] P:1769.22 E:0.103128 |  I wonder how many more challenges like that the referee
[908.44 - 910.60] P:1929.01 E:0.106517 |  is going to allow to accumulate,
[910.60 - 912.12] P:1771.24 E:0.106414 |  and the answer is no more.
[912.12 - 913.72] P:1731.99 E:0.102968 |  It's a yellow card for Jackson Irving.
[913.72 - 915.72] P:1793.74 E:0.100496 |  That's really classic of a referee.
[916.28 - 918.92] P:1799.67 E:0.099390 |  So he's seen four challenges that he thought might be,
[918.92 - 920.12] P:1660.95 E:0.111289 |  he might be, he might be.
[920.68 - 922.44] P:1739.37 E:0.108049 |  Jackson Irving makes his first challenge.
[923.16 - 924.12] P:1790.08 E:0.114226 |  So he gives him that, you know,
[924.12 - 927.00] P:1747.56 E:0.099225 |  and he's trodden in his foot,
[927.00 - 929.88] P:1787.60 E:0.099096 |  and many a referee will give a free kick for that.
[930.52 - 933.48] P:1632.20 E:0.098217 |  But for Jackson Irving, he's out there next game, isn't he?
[933.48 - 939.24] P:1490.32 E:0.099414 |  Yep. Australia have five players on a booking previously in the tournament.
[939.96 - 944.12] P:1677.03 E:0.109856 |  Jackson Irving, should they reach that quarterfinal against the Netherlands,
[944.12 - 946.04] P:1548.72 E:0.105234 |  will be missing for that match.
[946.04 - 948.20] P:1531.94 E:0.113405 |  The yellow cards wiped after the quarterfinals,
[948.20 - 949.64] P:1582.36 E:0.101844 |  so if you get booked in the semi-finals,
[949.64 - 950.68] P:1753.48 E:0.108585 |  you can't miss the final.
[950.68 - 952.28] P:1753.59 E:0.104979 |  That's the thinking behind that.
[953.00 - 954.44] P:1628.54 E:0.116817 |  But you can't focus on that now.
[954.44 - 955.96] P:1485.03 E:0.094264 |  You've got to play the game in front of you.
[956.60 - 959.40] P:1466.37 E:0.107758 |  Irving for this game is on the yellow card,
[959.96 - 963.08] P:1395.28 E:0.098779 |  and that is what he will have to think about primarily,
[963.08 - 966.28] P:1444.28 E:0.095390 |  as the ball is played and field by Rodrigo de Paul.
[966.28 - 968.20] P:1477.89 E:0.085248 |  The crossfield pass out to the left-hand,
[968.20 - 973.96] P:1572.50 E:0.092474 |  and Hernandez as Argentina looked to test DeGonalco once more.
[973.96 - 975.32] P:1645.05 E:0.079211 |  DeGonalco stands as ground,
[975.32 - 978.76] P:1698.79 E:0.086617 |  and so they go back to Rodrigo de Paul's central position,
[978.76 - 983.32] P:1679.80 E:0.089724 |  out to the right-hand side, and Molina receives the ball back,
[983.32 - 986.28] P:1702.09 E:0.085938 |  and they'll play it back to Mendoza Fernández.
[986.28 - 986.84] P:1458.99 E:0.095503 |  It's out.
[986.84 - 989.32] P:1582.76 E:0.089393 |  Now on the right-hand side, once more to Rodrigo de Paul,
[989.32 - 990.28] P:1585.32 E:0.085849 |  who's just drifting out.
[990.28 - 992.60] P:1569.10 E:0.106439 |  They're interchanging positions, Argentina.
[993.32 - 996.04] P:1750.70 E:0.104235 |  Hernandez from Australia out of their shape,
[996.04 - 999.24] P:1693.36 E:0.106939 |  and that's proving easier said than done at the moment.
[999.24 - 1002.20] P:1472.21 E:0.109153 |  15 minutes go, 0-0, and Argentina back on half-way.
[1002.20 - 1005.08] P:1794.17 E:0.103510 |  The concentration is so key in situations like this.
[1005.08 - 1007.24] P:1568.26 E:0.106336 |  Argentina know they're going to get more of the ball,
[1007.24 - 1010.60] P:1791.02 E:0.096758 |  and as the game develops here, they'll pass and pass and pass,
[1010.60 - 1012.52] P:1674.89 E:0.105789 |  hoping that someone will switch off.
[1012.52 - 1014.76] P:1729.61 E:0.106162 |  Because of the quality of what particularly we're messy,
[1014.76 - 1017.40] P:1571.35 E:0.094007 |  if you switch off in a half-a-year position,
[1017.40 - 1018.92] P:1650.50 E:0.108513 |  he will damage you with that.
[1018.92 - 1021.56] P:1472.46 E:0.089905 |  But so far, I don't think there's been a blade of grass
[1021.80 - 1024.92] P:1527.11 E:0.091634 |  in a position without their defending the other Australian team.
[1025.96 - 1028.20] P:1602.83 E:0.103925 |  And it's one step forward, two steps back,
[1028.20 - 1031.32] P:1546.01 E:0.085683 |  one step sideways, one step forward from Argentina,
[1031.96 - 1034.76] P:1523.09 E:0.088222 |  knocking it around very comfortably, but not making any headway.
[1034.76 - 1038.60] P:1617.68 E:0.098041 |  What can they do once more down this left-hand side,
[1038.60 - 1042.28] P:1721.49 E:0.105611 |  as the shot is ballooned over from the end of the penalty area,
[1042.28 - 1045.64] P:1787.66 E:0.097367 |  and the answer is not very much at all,
[1045.64 - 1047.80] P:1706.54 E:0.077074 |  as the effort came in from Gomez.
[1047.80 - 1048.84] P:1541.22 E:0.088855 |  I thought that was a feint.
[1049.72 - 1052.20] P:1652.85 E:0.103387 |  When he's hit, you get a feint in football,
[1052.20 - 1053.88] P:1744.57 E:0.100670 |  if you think a shot and he's out for a throw-in.
[1054.52 - 1057.08] P:1731.93 E:0.107382 |  It's very close to get out for a throw-in, that's all.
[1057.88 - 1059.96] P:1627.35 E:0.111589 |  I think his teammates have been looking at that,
[1059.96 - 1061.56] P:1669.61 E:0.089907 |  thinking you got lucky there, mate.
[1061.56 - 1063.80] P:1550.91 E:0.099672 |  The ball was bubbling, it was absolutely...
[1063.80 - 1066.44] P:1775.29 E:0.096008 |  You take the huge chance they have a shot from there,
[1066.44 - 1068.52] P:1470.71 E:0.097311 |  and that surprised it, it ended up mildly.
[1068.52 - 1070.20] P:1707.58 E:0.114715 |  Good distribution once again by Souter,
[1070.20 - 1071.80] P:1324.50 E:0.093158 |  but it won't stick to Jackson Irvine,
[1071.80 - 1073.88] P:1336.80 E:0.091179 |  who's just dropping back a little deeper now.
[1073.88 - 1077.40] P:1487.17 E:0.094728 |  The ball is over the top, headed out to the left-hand side by Messi,
[1077.40 - 1081.00] P:1411.13 E:0.091264 |  and picked up by Gomez once again, squeezes the ball to...
[1081.88 - 1085.48] P:1369.99 E:0.097278 |  And I stroke the magician on his 1,000th appearance,
[1085.48 - 1087.24] P:1546.11 E:0.104241 |  and he's looking for the return ball in the area,
[1087.24 - 1090.20] P:1462.23 E:0.092889 |  and there's that six-highs of Harry Souter,
[1090.20 - 1091.24] P:1576.31 E:0.087201 |  out to the right-hand side,
[1091.24 - 1093.88] P:1821.47 E:0.101356 |  and Deggeneck will clear away up towards halfway,
[1093.88 - 1096.84] P:1624.68 E:0.085562 |  0-0 here on five-life and BBC Sounds,
[1096.84 - 1099.96] P:1766.54 E:0.103034 |  as the ball is chested down by Enzo Fernandes.
[1101.56 - 1104.44] P:1730.72 E:0.105193 |  It's a point of a mess here, he didn't go up for a header with Souter.
[1105.00 - 1106.76] P:1690.47 E:0.092081 |  You know, he's only a foot taller.
[1107.48 - 1109.00] P:1745.03 E:0.117479 |  It's a free ball to play, isn't it?
[1109.00 - 1112.84] P:1621.51 E:0.088716 |  Back post to Souter, they're expecting Messi to be able to challenge him.
[1112.84 - 1114.44] P:1630.28 E:0.095749 |  But that's the first run that Messi's made,
[1114.44 - 1115.88] P:1645.80 E:0.097393 |  tried to go beyond the defence.
[1116.44 - 1119.16] P:1626.72 E:0.106171 |  It takes his time, and he only makes those runs
[1119.16 - 1120.84] P:1621.01 E:0.094242 |  when he sees there's a gap there.
[1120.84 - 1123.00] P:1443.64 E:0.104436 |  He doesn't make them to drag blows out of the way anymore.
[1123.64 - 1124.84] P:1640.26 E:0.096204 |  But you understand that.
[1124.84 - 1127.32] P:1549.46 E:0.091450 |  As I say, any other player, he wouldn't accept it,
[1127.32 - 1129.64] P:1295.00 E:0.101159 |  but because it's him, and you know that when he does get the ball,
[1129.64 - 1131.80] P:1646.86 E:0.092584 |  and then you said it, he will damage these.
[1133.00 - 1135.88] P:1461.95 E:0.110289 |  Australia have won the ball just inside the Argentina half,
[1135.96 - 1138.36] P:1470.68 E:0.107865 |  here is Reilly Magritte down the left-hand side, nil-nil.
[1139.24 - 1142.12] P:1726.77 E:0.098476 |  There's Magritte and Behege, and Irvine between them,
[1142.12 - 1145.32] P:1710.56 E:0.097421 |  work it down to the corner flag, a ball in by Irvine, Behege,
[1145.32 - 1147.48] P:1664.72 E:0.106315 |  trying to muscle his way down to the byline.
[1148.04 - 1150.52] P:1762.27 E:0.102645 |  Who goes out of play for an Argentina goal kick.
[1150.52 - 1153.64] P:1775.92 E:0.100681 |  For the first chance we've had, Pat, to see Behege getting forward there.
[1153.64 - 1157.24] P:1922.27 E:0.098875 |  Yeah, we talked about it all night, and he does get into great positions.
[1157.24 - 1159.08] P:1890.88 E:0.098209 |  When he's there, he looks comfortable, doesn't he?
[1159.08 - 1161.16] P:1877.41 E:0.095324 |  He believes that he can get to the byline.
[1161.16 - 1163.56] P:1739.14 E:0.084654 |  I mean, that's the left fullback, but that's the left fullback.
[1163.64 - 1166.52] P:1679.34 E:0.090735 |  That's much more comfortable going forward than...
[1166.52 - 1167.88] P:1654.10 E:0.107740 |  He's really unlucky there.
[1167.88 - 1170.44] P:1669.56 E:0.095435 |  He was looking for a penalty kick, and he wasn't looking for it,
[1170.44 - 1173.24] P:1662.65 E:0.090267 |  he was hoping for it, but I don't think it was enough of that,
[1173.24 - 1177.16] P:1542.24 E:0.092698 |  so he's got back into position, but first decent little bit of play
[1177.16 - 1179.40] P:1755.93 E:0.096113 |  down this left-hand side from the Austro-East,
[1179.40 - 1181.08] P:1574.15 E:0.086018 |  and it did look quite promising.
[1181.08 - 1184.04] P:1571.93 E:0.104070 |  And Australia pressing well inside the Argentina half,
[1184.04 - 1185.88] P:1670.23 E:0.097813 |  going back as their missed controls,
[1185.88 - 1187.88] P:1628.14 E:0.094429 |  and Argentina will bring it away.
[1187.88 - 1190.52] P:1575.36 E:0.089067 |  But again, as Argentina have it, they're both their own half,
[1190.52 - 1194.36] P:1590.14 E:0.091491 |  we have to praise the single-mindedness of Australia,
[1194.36 - 1196.92] P:1364.16 E:0.107083 |  and what I mean by that is when they go, they all go.
[1196.92 - 1198.28] P:1280.40 E:0.080352 |  That's the thing with the press, isn't it?
[1198.28 - 1200.44] P:1521.46 E:0.100575 |  You have to all go at once, and they haven't done it that much,
[1200.44 - 1203.96] P:1377.22 E:0.092311 |  but they all did it there, they won the ball back, backers lost it,
[1203.96 - 1207.48] P:1478.34 E:0.088795 |  but again, the team unity, it's not just about spirit,
[1207.48 - 1210.92] P:1305.99 E:0.085386 |  it's about tactics as well, and we've seen that from Australia
[1210.92 - 1213.56] P:1204.68 E:0.090669 |  in this tournament, particularly the second two group games,
[1213.56 - 1218.28] P:1479.93 E:0.091602 |  and so far, here as Argentina look to work it down that left-hand side once more,
[1218.28 - 1221.72] P:1845.55 E:0.100543 |  it's all the way back with Matt Ryan, the former Brighton man,
[1221.72 - 1225.32] P:1704.77 E:0.089528 |  and we have to say that, as Ryan plays it out to the left-hand side,
[1225.32 - 1227.96] P:1464.37 E:0.093579 |  neither goalkeeper has really had a thing to do.
[1227.96 - 1229.64] P:1725.11 E:0.102985 |  Yeah, you're playing chunks of games,
[1229.64 - 1232.20] P:1792.14 E:0.091310 |  particularly if you're the Australians just now,
[1232.20 - 1235.16] P:1539.70 E:0.088942 |  and that first chunk of just about 20 minutes,
[1235.16 - 1237.80] P:1737.39 E:0.098171 |  you know, with a few seconds off that just now,
[1237.80 - 1240.20] P:1842.52 E:0.108042 |  they've not only survived, they've held their own,
[1240.20 - 1242.20] P:1695.75 E:0.106169 |  they've not had as much of the ball, no one near it,
[1242.20 - 1243.88] P:1581.95 E:0.078628 |  but they're comfortable with that,
[1243.88 - 1246.92] P:1542.07 E:0.095614 |  and anyone who's got practice or possession,
[1247.00 - 1249.40] P:1370.89 E:0.100951 |  he's made his cover, covered them time and time again.
[1249.40 - 1252.44] P:1585.32 E:0.092032 |  It's been interesting, they've made a little technical change,
[1252.44 - 1256.36] P:1442.15 E:0.100010 |  and they're bringing Rayleigh Mcree most with the play in the left midfield area.
[1256.36 - 1259.48] P:1673.85 E:0.096114 |  He's done lots of good cover there, lots of hard work there.
[1259.48 - 1262.84] P:1551.71 E:0.101153 |  It's allowing Jackson Irvine to stay that further forward.
[1262.84 - 1265.64] P:1625.29 E:0.094006 |  From with Jackson Irvine, he's supposed to close down.
[1265.64 - 1268.84] P:1599.88 E:0.102554 |  He can't quite do it the same way just now, because he's on a yellow champ.
[1269.80 - 1274.84] P:1499.05 E:0.100281 |  Argentina are in position, 0-0, 20 minutes played here on Five Live,
[1274.84 - 1278.04] P:1494.75 E:0.095818 |  and BBC sounds as they work it out to the left-hand side.
[1278.04 - 1282.92] P:1519.79 E:0.088560 |  And Alexis McAllister will pick it up midway through the Australia half.
[1282.92 - 1285.80] P:1477.60 E:0.097682 |  Good foot in by Mitchell Duke, not mentioned to him yet so far,
[1285.80 - 1291.24] P:1411.29 E:0.090084 |  but good defensive work as it were on the halfway line by the striker,
[1291.80 - 1294.28] P:1412.33 E:0.106225 |  who was their hero against Tunisia.
[1295.72 - 1299.80] P:1522.70 E:0.100753 |  Both 1-0 wins for Australia against Tunisia and Denmark.
[1299.88 - 1305.32] P:1685.32 E:0.089995 |  The first time in a World Cup that they've won twice in one edition.
[1305.32 - 1307.72] P:1555.82 E:0.097687 |  The first time they've won back-to-back World Cup games.
[1307.72 - 1311.08] P:1384.69 E:0.096966 |  That's it. I mean, we could rattle through stats, honestly, for Australia for about two minutes.
[1311.08 - 1313.64] P:1402.97 E:0.101138 |  They are having the tournament of their lives.
[1313.64 - 1318.84] P:1513.59 E:0.100168 |  And when you think of that golden generation of Harry Kuhl and Mark Verducar and Tim Cahill,
[1318.84 - 1321.56] P:1362.30 E:0.090036 |  they got to the last 16 in 2006.
[1321.56 - 1324.20] P:1313.47 E:0.090711 |  Australia's still in position just inside their own half.
[1324.20 - 1327.88] P:1657.28 E:0.097179 |  They don't have the big names, the players that are playing right now
[1327.88 - 1331.08] P:1476.29 E:0.094805 |  at the very, very top level in the Premier League, for example.
[1331.64 - 1335.16] P:1444.79 E:0.098973 |  However, they've got a team unity, they've got good tactics,
[1335.16 - 1336.68] P:1447.35 E:0.101432 |  they've got spirit, they've got belief,
[1336.68 - 1341.40] P:1326.78 E:0.093264 |  and they've got a player here in Harry Souter just inside his own penalty area on the ball
[1341.40 - 1342.92] P:1350.07 E:0.114825 |  who's having the tournament of his life.
[1342.92 - 1344.28] P:1408.29 E:0.084962 |  Yeah, sometimes it happens like that.
[1345.24 - 1349.24] P:1328.88 E:0.096359 |  Every tackle he's made, he's made it right just about every header.
[1349.24 - 1351.88] P:1473.59 E:0.089866 |  He's timed it right and he's been in periods.
[1351.88 - 1354.76] P:1743.24 E:0.092241 |  And you can see him, you know, growing close to...
[1354.84 - 1359.64] P:1958.60 E:0.098489 |  The way he's passing the ball now, it's got a kind of calm confidence about it, you know.
[1359.64 - 1361.80] P:2128.69 E:0.107826 |  He really, really is loving it at the moment.
[1362.52 - 1364.44] P:2067.46 E:0.108691 |  Those Stoke fans are just so happy.
[1366.20 - 1368.60] P:1987.02 E:0.105200 |  Out to the left-hand side, go Australia.
[1368.60 - 1372.68] P:2012.82 E:0.097521 |  Still inside their own half, 0-0 on five live from BBC Sounds.
[1372.68 - 1377.32] P:1764.25 E:0.103715 |  A reminder that the World Cup Daily is your place for all the debate, reaction,
[1377.32 - 1379.88] P:1456.97 E:0.096875 |  and analysis across this World Cup.
[1379.88 - 1383.16] P:1470.46 E:0.082885 |  You can download that on BBC Sounds.
[1383.24 - 1385.00] P:1447.38 E:0.099209 |  Fresh one every morning for you.
[1385.64 - 1389.72] P:1656.03 E:0.103068 |  And of course, through the tournament, we still have you covered on all the wider stories as well.
[1389.72 - 1392.52] P:1709.05 E:0.086605 |  Plenty of content on BBC Sounds and the BBC iPlay.
[1392.52 - 1397.88] P:1699.89 E:0.103227 |  You can check out the sports desk for a look at some of those wider stories around this tournament.
[1398.44 - 1402.92] P:1617.69 E:0.095066 |  At mid Hashim, the Katari Football Journalists, one of the guests on that.
[1402.92 - 1406.84] P:1531.95 E:0.097410 |  So Australia come down the right-hand side and they're just growing into this game.
[1406.84 - 1408.84] P:1356.23 E:0.103183 |  Yeah, that's the best piece of football.
[1408.84 - 1411.32] P:1640.11 E:0.094242 |  They were at the back, they were being closed down.
[1411.40 - 1414.12] P:1684.42 E:0.096394 |  By the way, Australia are not parking the bus.
[1414.12 - 1415.40] P:1668.99 E:0.091071 |  It's not like that.
[1415.40 - 1418.92] P:1632.76 E:0.094894 |  When they get the ball, they play it out, confidence on the back usually from cash.
[1419.48 - 1422.04] P:1715.91 E:0.100141 |  But they've got four, five, six players up the field just now.
[1422.04 - 1422.92] P:1008.70 E:0.111731 |  I mean, this is not.
[1423.80 - 1428.52] P:1596.39 E:0.117484 |  Now suddenly they're going through the gears as Lecky wins the corner off a Kunya,
[1428.52 - 1434.60] P:1691.30 E:0.097907 |  and that little sunshine patch down there to our right is cheering because at the opposite end,
[1434.60 - 1436.04] P:1658.69 E:0.095332 |  Australia have a set piece.
[1436.04 - 1439.00] P:1532.29 E:0.095696 |  Right, without getting too carried away against Denmark.
[1439.00 - 1441.80] P:1606.19 E:0.101775 |  At this point in time, the Asturian should have been about three down.
[1441.80 - 1447.40] P:1711.65 E:0.105645 |  It doesn't feel like that this time, but they then grew slowly but surely into the game because
[1447.40 - 1451.08] P:1621.02 E:0.104609 |  they knew how to play, they knew their foothold, and then they started being braver,
[1451.08 - 1452.76] P:1655.95 E:0.109015 |  slowly but surely became the better side.
[1452.76 - 1456.36] P:1616.51 E:0.095754 |  Now that's a big jump, as we say, to get to Argentina.
[1456.36 - 1458.52] P:1602.28 E:0.094967 |  But you can see a little change, can't you?
[1458.52 - 1460.84] P:1571.52 E:0.105675 |  They want to play a little bit more further forward than the front foot.
[1461.88 - 1465.64] P:1620.06 E:0.101357 |  So corner for Australia, looking for the breakthrough against Argentina.
[1465.64 - 1468.12] P:1596.55 E:0.100501 |  Moise swings it in, it's powerfully headed away.
[1469.08 - 1471.96] P:1297.91 E:0.095649 |  Come back out to Aaron Moy on the right-hand side.
[1471.96 - 1475.96] P:1648.82 E:0.096599 |  0-0 on five live in BBC Sands as Moy swings the ball back in.
[1475.96 - 1480.76] P:2083.53 E:0.108606 |  It's over the head of Jackson Irvine and out for an Argentina goal kick.
[1480.76 - 1483.64] P:1947.10 E:0.105050 |  Full time in the rugby Gloucester, Northampton.
[1483.64 - 1484.68] P:1349.46 E:0.094342 |  Sarah Orchardt.
[1484.68 - 1486.76] P:1372.75 E:0.104362 |  Gloucester 34, Northampton 19.
[1486.76 - 1488.44] P:1652.73 E:0.101903 |  It's a bonus point win for Gloucester.
[1488.44 - 1492.36] P:1741.29 E:0.099125 |  Lifts them into the top four but still with that Bristol Leicester game to come.
[1492.36 - 1494.92] P:1742.39 E:0.096816 |  I have to tell you, plenty of atmosphere under the lights at Kingshome,
[1494.92 - 1498.60] P:1818.05 E:0.096238 |  Vicky, where the fans in the shed, and they certainly give those Argentina fans a run for
[1498.60 - 1501.32] P:1217.90 E:0.099347 |  their money. Full time, Gloucester 34, Northampton 19.
[1502.28 - 1503.96] P:1390.49 E:0.102176 |  Thanks Sarah, it's Argentina.
[1504.52 - 1506.92] P:1588.72 E:0.103430 |  Clear the ball out of play for an Australia throw.
[1506.92 - 1510.36] P:1612.07 E:0.094182 |  Right Pat, 24 minutes in, let's make no bones about it.
[1510.36 - 1511.48] P:1203.13 E:0.094529 |  Argentina have been poor.
[1511.48 - 1512.52] P:1344.72 E:0.097613 |  Yeah, I've been poor, yeah.
[1512.52 - 1514.04] P:1509.16 E:0.098929 |  I will not argue up for a second.
[1514.04 - 1516.92] P:1698.53 E:0.100181 |  There's not one Argentinean player I would say, he's having a good game.
[1516.92 - 1518.76] P:1800.13 E:0.096496 |  He's using a great good game here.
[1518.76 - 1521.00] P:1941.06 E:0.100894 |  Not one, they're not playing that good enough pace.
[1521.56 - 1524.52] P:2070.66 E:0.108717 |  It may well be that, you know, they're going to sit back about and try and play in the
[1524.52 - 1526.92] P:2123.18 E:0.105940 |  breakaway bit now, but it doesn't look like that.
[1526.92 - 1530.84] P:2049.23 E:0.101931 |  It looks like the Aussies have said, right, okay, breakers down, okay, you don't look
[1530.84 - 1532.12] P:1863.23 E:0.085299 |  as if you can breakers down.
[1532.12 - 1534.76] P:1745.51 E:0.098141 |  We're not worried about you being physically fitter than us.
[1534.76 - 1537.16] P:1698.49 E:0.093953 |  Yeah, we've had four hours more sleep.
[1537.16 - 1539.16] P:1745.60 E:0.096679 |  That makes that much of a difference.
[1539.16 - 1542.52] P:1733.70 E:0.106831 |  But at this point in time, you're looking at them and this is if,
[1543.24 - 1544.60] P:1586.21 E:0.119719 |  you've lacked a little bit of belief.
[1544.60 - 1546.44] P:1739.02 E:0.104069 |  I think they look to the main man.
[1546.44 - 1547.40] P:1734.68 E:0.112497 |  They look to Messi.
[1548.20 - 1550.60] P:1435.46 E:0.101968 |  And he has been walking so far hasn't he?
[1550.60 - 1551.56] P:1563.05 E:0.113088 |  Let's be honest about it.
[1551.56 - 1553.96] P:1717.62 E:0.104479 |  You may be fair, he's been walking so far.
[1554.68 - 1556.60] P:1570.68 E:0.103148 |  He's done the square, square root of nothing.
[1557.24 - 1558.44] P:1712.02 E:0.097036 |  That's the problem with Messi.
[1558.44 - 1562.44] P:1657.33 E:0.094906 |  You can do that for 80 minutes and then let's go to the best goals you've ever seen.
[1563.00 - 1565.88] P:1509.00 E:0.102897 |  But when you're playing against that and you know that the teams can't press you,
[1565.88 - 1569.88] P:1564.08 E:0.091102 |  because they can press you because you have to do that with living men or with ten outfield
[1569.88 - 1571.56] P:1647.66 E:0.082687 |  players, you can't do that with Messi.
[1571.56 - 1575.56] P:1597.58 E:0.098313 |  And that's why you get a little bit more belief in Molley getting himself in the ball quite a bit
[1575.56 - 1577.56] P:1763.32 E:0.080629 |  now, playing it comfortably.
[1577.56 - 1580.68] P:1748.80 E:0.092568 |  You know, at the back there, you do feel much, much better.
[1580.68 - 1584.28] P:1657.51 E:0.084729 |  But we know this game is like it can change in the blink of an eye.
[1585.48 - 1590.28] P:1460.68 E:0.094893 |  25 minutes gone, Australia in possession inside their own penalty area.
[1590.28 - 1593.48] P:1495.85 E:0.096739 |  You're absolutely right, it can and Messi is a player that can do that.
[1593.48 - 1597.00] P:1663.87 E:0.106262 |  But with every second, with every minute, with every throw they win,
[1597.00 - 1602.92] P:1560.77 E:0.087324 |  with every pass they can flee, the belief from Australia, you can just sense it's going.
[1602.92 - 1604.36] P:1548.46 E:0.108424 |  I thought we were going to see everybody if you take.
[1605.16 - 1608.60] P:1671.00 E:0.089713 |  No, actually the corners and things like that, they get in the free kicks.
[1608.60 - 1610.44] P:1534.96 E:0.095295 |  When they've got the big centre-backs coming up, they say,
[1610.44 - 1612.20] P:1629.67 E:0.096580 |  what a difference that's going to make.
[1612.20 - 1616.84] P:1601.58 E:0.092359 |  Sutter, you mean he attacked the first one there, didn't get you, but every time they get
[1617.56 - 1621.64] P:1665.51 E:0.100704 |  a corner kick or free kick, you know that every Argentinian fan in here is thinking,
[1621.64 - 1624.36] P:1471.59 E:0.098683 |  oh dear, because they know the pill that is it back.
[1625.88 - 1630.76] P:1457.83 E:0.106157 |  All over the top from Harry Sutter once again is a good one, Jackson Irvine does well,
[1630.76 - 1635.16] P:1310.39 E:0.097413 |  just to keep it in with his head and gets it back from Riley McRee down the left hand side
[1635.16 - 1639.56] P:1517.91 E:0.097111 |  in field to be hitched, approaching the penalty area of 100-3, blue and white shirts.
[1640.28 - 1644.60] P:1466.21 E:0.103412 |  It's rather aimless from Argentina, big hoof over the halfway line all the way through to Matt
[1644.60 - 1649.40] P:1520.53 E:0.095336 |  Ryan, nearly a meal. It was aimless, but it was only about a foot away from Messi,
[1649.96 - 1654.12] P:1433.88 E:0.095413 |  he didn't chase it, did he? He didn't move, he just kind of walked it, watched it go over his head.
[1655.56 - 1659.80] P:1457.84 E:0.102186 |  Behege will bring down that ball that almost went over his head,
[1659.80 - 1661.88] P:1542.52 E:0.097138 |  just about kept it in there, say the officials.
[1662.68 - 1665.80] P:1523.09 E:0.107093 |  Australia have lost it, they lost the throw as well.
[1665.80 - 1670.28] P:1695.92 E:0.090953 |  You see where Behege is then again, he's right on the opponent's fire line,
[1670.28 - 1675.40] P:1535.78 E:0.090729 |  you're actually left back there, they are growing into the game all over the pitch now,
[1675.40 - 1680.20] P:1670.80 E:0.097759 |  the Australians, and you can see, I didn't see much fear at the start of the game,
[1680.20 - 1686.76] P:1841.94 E:0.102666 |  but any of the hard, we're not beginning, it is flowing away, flowing away at the moment.
[1687.64 - 1693.00] P:1570.30 E:0.100824 |  And again, they put on the press at the right side, Mitchell Tude goes, it's a miscute from Romero,
[1693.00 - 1697.48] P:1257.60 E:0.099958 |  who skews it straight out of play for an Australia throw, and Graham Arnold, who is just wandering
[1697.48 - 1705.08] P:1468.49 E:0.099171 |  back to his technical area, he will be absolutely delighted with how Australia have managed themselves,
[1705.08 - 1709.48] P:1480.99 E:0.092362 |  have managed the game in these opening 27 minutes, Behege with the throw,
[1709.48 - 1714.76] P:1565.58 E:0.097983 |  0-0 on five live and BBC sounds, but Jackson Irvine wins the corner, and at the moment,
[1714.76 - 1719.00] P:1587.24 E:0.102692 |  Australia are the better team. Yep, there was that turnaround, it was after about
[1719.72 - 1724.12] P:1604.38 E:0.103420 |  23 minutes, just a little bit played out from the back, and since they played out from the back,
[1724.68 - 1728.36] P:1685.98 E:0.098407 |  they've had just a bit of the ball for the entirety of that next four or five minutes,
[1728.36 - 1731.24] P:1743.09 E:0.098672 |  they played really well, got another one of those corners.
[1732.12 - 1738.04] P:1293.25 E:0.095249 |  And the heights of Souter is up from the back, Mitch Dukes in there as well, as Riley McGrath
[1738.04 - 1741.96] P:1513.01 E:0.102486 |  swings the corner in, in the head, it is won by Australia on the edge of the six-yard box,
[1741.96 - 1748.20] P:1534.38 E:0.095140 |  Argentina get the second contact, and will clear it away, but again, they're causing real problem,
[1748.20 - 1752.52] P:1528.44 E:0.086746 |  Souter there with that six-foot-six frame, as Australia come forward once again,
[1752.52 - 1756.28] P:1658.46 E:0.098405 |  down that right-hand side with Matthew Leckie under pressure down by the corner,
[1756.28 - 1760.60] P:1718.24 E:0.106787 |  very well dispossessed in the end, and the ball will be caught away by a Cunier,
[1760.60 - 1765.80] P:1729.65 E:0.099985 |  who is then fouled by Leckie, and Argentina have the free kick, but warning signs for
[1765.80 - 1769.32] P:1452.01 E:0.092113 |  Argentina that they simply are not heeding. That's the best chance of the game so far,
[1769.32 - 1773.40] P:1620.81 E:0.087324 |  best chance to get memory, it's not an absolute easy chance, he's got a header
[1773.40 - 1778.52] P:1635.96 E:0.094850 |  towards the goal in the general area, he's got very, very high for that, Souter,
[1778.52 - 1782.68] P:1527.04 E:0.093710 |  headed down, he's a good foot above the man, it's Markham, I haven't said that,
[1782.68 - 1786.52] P:1569.75 E:0.097662 |  he's got his hands and shoulders which can help, but it just showed you again,
[1786.52 - 1790.84] P:1587.83 E:0.095983 |  the belief is becoming, coming into it, and you're looking at Argentina, you think,
[1790.84 - 1799.00] P:1560.02 E:0.093337 |  you're going to start soon. 29 minutes gone, nil-nil, well they certainly started
[1799.64 - 1806.60] P:1295.36 E:0.093729 |  this World Cup campaign very slowly, the shock defeats to Saudi Arabia,
[1807.40 - 1813.48] P:1477.21 E:0.096969 |  this will really to overstate how much of a shock that was, but were they to come a cropper
[1813.48 - 1818.60] P:1465.66 E:0.092942 |  against Australia in the last 16, Australia who have never reached the quarterfinals,
[1819.32 - 1824.68] P:1595.89 E:0.095897 |  and that would be right up there, given the context of this tournament, 38th in the world,
[1824.68 - 1830.44] P:1797.69 E:0.098282 |  Australia, third in the world Argentina, as Mitchell-Jekos challenged on the halfway line,
[1830.44 - 1834.20] P:1441.91 E:0.086580 |  and Argentina will come away with the ball, and Acunha, Vakighe goes to automatic.
[1834.20 - 1839.24] P:1584.39 E:0.088384 |  I can tell why he was annoyed, that's a two-foot attack for me, Romero comes in there,
[1839.80 - 1843.96] P:1590.55 E:0.091457 |  he's off the ground, he's two feet off the ground, and it wins the ball, it doesn't matter,
[1843.96 - 1847.96] P:1579.52 E:0.097856 |  you're not supposed to win two-foot, it's very fortunate, not together we have to kick that.
[1849.00 - 1853.80] P:1526.16 E:0.106521 |  Argentina coming down the right-hand side, here is Gomez, plays it in field,
[1853.80 - 1859.48] P:1710.17 E:0.094480 |  Missy, the feet were going, but they couldn't trip their way past that golden wall,
[1859.48 - 1862.36] P:1810.63 E:0.098935 |  the ball is out of play for an Argentina throw.
[1862.36 - 1865.40] P:1698.23 E:0.104405 |  The one that that's message is saying right, okay, I've had enough of this,
[1865.96 - 1869.48] P:1688.32 E:0.105012 |  you know, not really creating anything, he's got the ball two or three times in the last minute,
[1869.48 - 1871.80] P:1605.65 E:0.099758 |  so he started looking much more dangerous.
[1872.76 - 1877.64] P:1387.53 E:0.093241 |  Out to the left-hand side, Argentina go, but once again, they're locked to go back to halfway,
[1877.64 - 1881.88] P:1234.50 E:0.087570 |  and also Mendees, squares it to Rodrigo de Paul, and now forward to Missy,
[1881.88 - 1885.64] P:1455.79 E:0.107169 |  once more, good foot in by backers, and it will fall kindly for Australia,
[1885.64 - 1888.68] P:1599.51 E:0.086682 |  McGree, Duke, takes it forward, looking for the run of Lecky,
[1888.68 - 1895.16] P:1422.65 E:0.083348 |  Argentina a little bit stretched here, Australia, fire a couple of head tennis efforts,
[1895.16 - 1897.64] P:1494.02 E:0.109819 |  managed to keep possession, and they win the free kick as well,
[1897.64 - 1900.60] P:1913.37 E:0.101294 |  let's bring in the former Australia captain, Yuli Edinach.
[1901.32 - 1906.28] P:1807.83 E:0.101260 |  Yeah, listen, obviously Australia growing into the game, but need full concentration,
[1906.28 - 1908.60] P:1595.28 E:0.090017 |  definitely when they turn the possession over.
[1908.60 - 1914.20] P:1725.55 E:0.079735 |  Argentina, who have conceded the free kick?
[1914.20 - 1918.04] P:1687.62 E:0.096912 |  I have to agree with you, the concentration is effective now,
[1918.04 - 1922.28] P:1713.42 E:0.103130 |  just right, they've got itself in the game now, your left back flying down, playing with the left
[1922.28 - 1928.36] P:1712.76 E:0.098834 |  wing, you're beginning to really believe, but you have to watch on the counter, the Argentines are
[1928.36 - 1932.36] P:1720.70 E:0.100980 |  very, very good side, however, you're going to go through in a world cup, you're going to get to the
[1932.36 - 1937.16] P:1624.98 E:0.100724 |  next round of quarter-finals, go and take chances, and they're getting plenty of made up for this free
[1937.16 - 1939.40] P:1414.28 E:0.089960 |  kick, it's a very high line from Argentina, isn't it?
[1940.28 - 1947.88] P:1297.68 E:0.095056 |  It is, it's about 10 yards or so almost outside of that penalty area, as the ball is played in by
[1947.88 - 1955.16] P:1914.21 E:0.102409 |  Aaron Moy, it's over the head of everybody in and out of play for an Argentina throw, 0-0, 32 minutes gone.
[1955.16 - 1960.76] P:1690.65 E:0.094667 |  And that's the correct score, you know, I think if anything, last five, ten minutes, we agree that
[1961.32 - 1967.72] P:1492.42 E:0.094332 |  Australia are shading it, but they are being very disappointing, the Argentines take nothing away
[1967.72 - 1971.88] P:1319.50 E:0.093228 |  for the fact they're not getting easy space, Messi's doing everything they possibly can,
[1971.88 - 1976.04] P:1479.68 E:0.099457 |  I think he's waiting for the game to slow down a little bit so that those gaps begin to appear.
[1977.16 - 1980.52] P:1356.41 E:0.101189 |  Argentina under pressure just worked the ball out of their penalty area,
[1980.52 - 1985.48] P:1587.43 E:0.095020 |  backers almost intercepted midway through their half, but they will now come down this left hand
[1985.80 - 1991.56] P:1290.05 E:0.086831 |  side, but again, go in field, and the momentum of the attack just slows as the gold shirts get
[1991.56 - 1998.92] P:1339.42 E:0.084585 |  back into formation for Australia, 0-0 on five-live, and BBC sounds as Gomez has it for Argentina.
[1998.92 - 2005.00] P:1314.31 E:0.094568 |  I think it's really great, they are working so hard, Australia, we say Argentina have been
[2005.00 - 2010.92] P:1331.65 E:0.089786 |  poor and they have been, but Australia are making it hard for them to earn every inch of space,
[2010.92 - 2015.96] P:1199.87 E:0.096465 |  that's a nice turn there by McAllister, 35 yards out, forward into the penalty area,
[2015.96 - 2021.16] P:1476.00 E:0.091974 |  is headed away by Rolls, helped on by Mitchell Duke, Argentina will almost pick it up once more,
[2021.16 - 2026.44] P:1654.40 E:0.094675 |  good anticipation by Keanu Bacchus and manages to squeeze the ball up towards halfway,
[2026.44 - 2031.32] P:1413.58 E:0.092663 |  where it is intercepted by Enzo Fernandez, and Argentina will play it out to the right hand
[2031.32 - 2037.40] P:1529.27 E:0.094086 |  side, but Behic intercepts himself, the Australia left back, running into trouble there and just
[2037.40 - 2044.04] P:1715.74 E:0.106511 |  runs out of play, and a little push there from Lionel Messi on Behic, he throws his Argentinas,
[2044.04 - 2049.48] P:1628.67 E:0.099732 |  but Messi there just showing that glimpse of Argentinian frustration because this half is not
[2049.48 - 2055.08] P:1712.18 E:0.098809 |  going well for them, although it's still no no. Yeah, Messi is going to throw a fist there in his back,
[2055.08 - 2060.20] P:1706.74 E:0.117535 |  and then push Behic as well, I think Behic should be delighted with that, however he won't be delighted
[2060.20 - 2065.16] P:1877.43 E:0.106418 |  now because it's a bit excitable, that goes in the back of, as he goes Messi goes in the back of,
[2065.16 - 2070.52] P:1884.66 E:0.112554 |  gives Afrika a good win at being in his position. Yeah, just by this near corner flag, and you can
[2070.52 - 2075.40] P:1639.81 E:0.103241 |  hear the Argentina fans, they're not responding to the free kick, they're responding to the little
[2075.40 - 2081.32] P:1618.25 E:0.101620 |  push by Messi on Behic, and suddenly Argentinas fans have broken up, can the players do so?
[2082.52 - 2087.56] P:1661.59 E:0.103636 |  I'd rather say not for Behic, just a little bit too close, if you go too close, put a hand in the back,
[2088.36 - 2093.48] P:1654.19 E:0.091644 |  there's a lot of players that just fall over, and this is Afrika in a very dangerous position,
[2093.48 - 2098.28] P:1592.26 E:0.090981 |  slightly bowed in the corner, I would suggest. Do you think Messi may have a shot from here?
[2099.88 - 2104.52] P:1546.00 E:0.098014 |  Well, Matt Ryan at the moment is organising his defensive line on the edge of the six-yard box,
[2105.16 - 2111.48] P:1436.25 E:0.086009 |  needs to stay switched on here, Lionel Messi, eight yards or so up from the corner flag, just
[2111.48 - 2116.52] P:1625.78 E:0.098444 |  three yards in from the touch line, as the ball was swung right on top of Ryan,
[2116.52 - 2120.04] P:1531.33 E:0.094718 |  skeered away by Australia, comes back out to Messi on this right-hand side, nil-nil,
[2120.12 - 2125.00] P:1611.90 E:0.102078 |  a five-lifetime BBC sound as Messi plays it in field, this is better from Argentina,
[2125.64 - 2133.48] P:1695.15 E:0.110762 |  and that's what they can do, Lionel Messi finishes off a lovely intricate move inside the box,
[2133.48 - 2141.40] P:1592.67 E:0.109162 |  and on his 1,000th appearance for club and country, he gives Argentina a barely
[2141.40 - 2146.84] P:1486.40 E:0.109075 |  deserved lead against Australia, it's magic from Messi once again, it's won in Argentina.
[2147.40 - 2151.56] P:1689.09 E:0.108182 |  About three minutes ago, it's as if Messi stayed right over the enough of this,
[2151.56 - 2154.60] P:1729.92 E:0.106658 |  we got the ball, we went in a couple of dribbles, didn't give away anyone,
[2154.60 - 2158.12] P:1680.90 E:0.113832 |  then he gets a free kick down in the corner here, it lifts everybody but a little bit,
[2158.76 - 2165.00] P:1664.64 E:0.114951 |  and then his 1-2 from the side there, he passes the ball differently from any other football,
[2165.00 - 2169.80] P:1555.27 E:0.109033 |  he zips it into the middle, keeps on making the run, when it eventually lands at him,
[2169.80 - 2174.68] P:1651.67 E:0.109269 |  it hadn't left his boot, he knew it was in, didn't he? He absolutely knew it was in,
[2174.68 - 2180.44] P:1684.44 E:0.105035 |  it wasn't even a goal chance, it wasn't even close to, the man is, let's just see it one more time,
[2183.64 - 2193.24] P:1548.13 E:0.102533 |  789 goals on his 1,000th appearance, he's now just one away from drawing level with
[2193.24 - 2199.24] P:1584.65 E:0.104898 |  Gabriel Batistuta as Argentina's record World Cup goal scorer, and as you say Pat,
[2199.24 - 2202.76] P:1548.47 E:0.107805 |  from our angle up here which was a good one, but because it's Messi as well,
[2202.76 - 2206.12] P:1496.61 E:0.112322 |  you knew when that ball left his boot, and Australia I think knew as well.
[2207.24 - 2212.04] P:1759.91 E:0.106835 |  Yeah, it's incredible that he can pick up on the left hand side, because as he's
[2212.04 - 2216.76] P:1759.70 E:0.108092 |  picking on the right hand side with his left foot, he can curl, he can hit it hard,
[2217.32 - 2221.64] P:1776.49 E:0.109109 |  this time he goes through the legs, now I'm not going to, I'm not sure if he meant to play
[2221.64 - 2225.48] P:1853.87 E:0.105768 |  through the legs, but you know I would not put it past him.
[2226.44 - 2234.92] P:1560.24 E:0.098174 |  And all Australia's hard work is undone, and Argentina suddenly have that zip, that vigor,
[2235.88 - 2243.40] P:1683.43 E:0.096777 |  it's been sparked once again by the little magician, would you believe it is his first
[2243.40 - 2250.12] P:1945.94 E:0.096893 |  goal in the World Cup knockout stages, it takes him onto nine across his career, but like Ronaldo,
[2250.12 - 2254.76] P:1708.49 E:0.089585 |  the previous eight have come in the group stages as Argentina win a pre-kick on the
[2254.84 - 2259.80] P:1679.60 E:0.097735 |  half-way line, that's it for Messi, this is always the story when it comes to the World Cup,
[2259.80 - 2265.96] P:1589.96 E:0.090608 |  what will almost certainly be his last shot at the biggest prize in World Football.
[2267.48 - 2271.64] P:1689.79 E:0.108986 |  Will it happen for Argentina? It gets harder and harder as competition goes on, it scores goals,
[2273.08 - 2280.12] P:1748.96 E:0.104330 |  and he has scored brilliantly in the group phases etc, he's now on three years of the tournament
[2280.12 - 2284.60] P:1788.51 E:0.103905 |  so far, and the feeling always was, and it's the man who's done a question, you know,
[2285.32 - 2289.96] P:1734.47 E:0.106214 |  it's going to need him to win this World Cup, it is going to need Messi to win the World Cup,
[2289.96 - 2296.36] P:1822.54 E:0.110696 |  well he's started, he's doing his job, he's doing what is needed of him to push his team all the way on,
[2296.36 - 2299.88] P:1827.11 E:0.106351 |  because let's be absolutely honest, nobody else in his team would look like they were going to do it the other day.
[2301.00 - 2307.80] P:1550.02 E:0.105100 |  Another pre-kick for Argentina over on the far side and Deghanek is protesting, he's gone into the book,
[2307.88 - 2314.68] P:1521.20 E:0.097466 |  he's another that would miss the quarterfinal, were Australia to turn this around against Argentina,
[2314.68 - 2319.00] P:1527.13 E:0.097111 |  but again Pat, that's secondary to the fact that now Australia's right back is on the yellow.
[2319.56 - 2323.96] P:1648.08 E:0.106064 |  Yeah, it's a lot of shame that, it's a slap on the side of the face, it's not deliberate,
[2324.52 - 2329.56] P:1773.40 E:0.099673 |  it's a bit harsh, you know the Argentinians are going to make the most of every single contact,
[2331.08 - 2334.52] P:1675.85 E:0.095062 |  the only upside for the experienced is, they've come in round with eight backs,
[2334.60 - 2337.80] P:1778.18 E:0.095697 |  they've got plenty of rebounds, they've got another two they can pick on that are just as good,
[2337.80 - 2343.64] P:1763.49 E:0.095605 |  so that's one area that I don't think there's too much of a concern yet, other than the fact that they get sent off.
[2344.20 - 2348.20] P:1536.73 E:0.107550 |  Yeah, they've had to use him in this tournament as well as Martinez clears the way for Argentina,
[2348.20 - 2353.00] P:1581.26 E:0.108177 |  Nathaniel Atkinson picking up that injury, Frank Karacic has been deployed there,
[2353.88 - 2358.60] P:1562.22 E:0.106066 |  so they do as Pat says have options, Deghanek now has stayed down inside the
[2359.24 - 2361.48] P:1458.06 E:0.100696 |  Australia half as the ball has gone out of play.
[2361.96 - 2368.60] P:1704.51 E:0.080252 |  Yeah, look, as the Australians are complaining, say yeah, we've had one fill and we've got a booking,
[2368.60 - 2373.48] P:1637.26 E:0.084971 |  the Kunar, to be honest, I don't think the Kunar touched him there, I think he's just fallen
[2373.48 - 2378.68] P:1750.45 E:0.087188 |  in an odd angle, so I don't even think that was a free kick, but they've got it, they've played on and
[2379.56 - 2383.72] P:1655.41 E:0.099714 |  Australia, I mean they had that for the game, they were playing quite well, they were holding the ball well
[2384.36 - 2389.80] P:1779.80 E:0.097952 |  and that's the thing we said before we miss it, you can do the square root of nothing for 20 minutes,
[2389.80 - 2394.60] P:1815.11 E:0.110131 |  I think it's the same to go a score, it's got a goal, I need to just turn it over for two or three minutes and that's been enough.
[2395.40 - 2401.48] P:1451.81 E:0.104464 |  Four-four by Australia is redwell by Acuña over on that left-hand side and he'll clear up towards
[2401.48 - 2407.48] P:1427.73 E:0.098000 |  halfway as Graham Arnold stands, hands on hips on the corner of that dotted technical area,
[2408.04 - 2412.36] P:1448.98 E:0.104003 |  he played against Diego Maradona as a player for Australia, Graham Arnold,
[2413.48 - 2419.00] P:1469.46 E:0.100065 |  he now has to find a way as a manager to deal with the magic of Messi and it's Messi,
[2419.80 - 2428.12] P:1695.18 E:0.106123 |  no surprise he's given Argentina this one-nil lead on five-live and bigotry sounds as we approach the final five minutes plus at a time
[2428.68 - 2433.56] P:1610.98 E:0.104122 |  at the ends of this first half, Australia with the throw on the far side did their own half.
[2433.56 - 2439.24] P:1786.71 E:0.107932 |  I say that's the first time in 20 minutes that the Argentinians are close, fairly high up the field,
[2439.24 - 2443.96] P:1756.21 E:0.114137 |  just don't do it, they don't want to do it, they don't feel as if they're capable of doing it in this game against the Aussies,
[2444.92 - 2447.96] P:1644.83 E:0.114676 |  but the Aussies try to keep their mentality right now,
[2448.76 - 2457.32] P:1841.90 E:0.111153 |  the goal zone, they need to find something from somewhere and they have got a movable stadium around them just now, because it's bouncing.
[2459.56 - 2466.76] P:1612.33 E:0.102185 |  You can hear the sounds, you can hear the enjoyment, the Argentina fans are loving this, it is a stadium,
[2466.76 - 2472.84] P:1485.60 E:0.101016 |  the Atman-Binali Stadium, as Argentina play the ball over halfway, that Australia have fond memories of,
[2472.84 - 2477.48] P:1524.71 E:0.103579 |  this is where they beat Peru in the playoff final to reach the World Cup, but they're trailing here
[2478.60 - 2482.28] P:1626.20 E:0.093260 |  via goltenil to Argentina and to Lionel Messi.
[2482.28 - 2485.00] P:1588.93 E:0.097842 |  So Argentina spread it out to the left-hand sides,
[2485.88 - 2493.16] P:1730.17 E:0.100838 |  once again we'll work it back to the centre circle where Tottenham's Christian Ramiro will at walking pace bring the ball forward,
[2494.20 - 2500.52] P:1596.85 E:0.100249 |  played forward now to Pabre Gomez, this is out to the right-hand side and Molina he goes and Rodrigo Deport,
[2501.48 - 2508.84] P:1625.01 E:0.106612 |  orchestrates things in that centre for Argentina, we'll play it to Enzo Fernandez and out to the left-hand side they go once more with Acunha,
[2508.84 - 2512.20] P:1637.14 E:0.100316 |  here is Alexis McAllister of Brighton in Argentina,
[2513.08 - 2518.20] P:1489.12 E:0.101895 |  very happy, very comfortable, a much happier and much more comfortable now they've got the one goal advantage.
[2518.60 - 2522.52] P:1650.91 E:0.101126 |  Yeah, it's one of those games where you play the style that Argentina have played,
[2522.52 - 2525.88] P:1613.79 E:0.110524 |  and totally score a goal, you say well you're not doing well, you're not holding the ball well,
[2526.52 - 2530.68] P:1718.91 E:0.099601 |  you score a goal you think, right, you're controlling it now, because that's now what they're doing as soon as,
[2531.48 - 2532.68] P:1692.33 E:0.108636 |  it's super well,
[2533.08 - 2535.96] P:1959.06 E:0.120556 |  Messi's got a little bit of a happy old over here for a team,
[2536.28 - 2537.96] P:2065.09 E:0.115955 |  you've got a 50-50 chance to meet,
[2538.28 - 2543.88] P:2028.86 E:0.104890 |  yeah, Harry Cicero was yet going in, Argentina have played the ball out because Messi is down,
[2545.64 - 2546.68] P:1975.65 E:0.130922 |  holding that boot,
[2547.48 - 2548.60] P:1778.28 E:0.119644 |  and are up three,
[2548.60 - 2549.56] P:1940.40 E:0.093787 |  yeah it's difficult,
[2549.56 - 2553.00] P:1707.46 E:0.094991 |  no, he said there was nothing wrong with that, he has gone over now the Polish referee,
[2553.08 - 2554.28] P:1742.88 E:0.088875 |  Shimomar Ciliak,
[2554.92 - 2555.80] P:1569.31 E:0.110560 |  and Lionel Messi,
[2556.68 - 2560.04] P:1525.33 E:0.096289 |  just raising a hand and saying well, could have done with a bit of help there,
[2560.04 - 2563.08] P:1618.05 E:0.096239 |  and he is caught on the top of the boots accidentally by Cicero,
[2563.08 - 2563.32] P:1148.51 E:0.115441 |  but still.
[2563.32 - 2565.48] P:1696.50 E:0.102430 |  But now you can do about that, if you're a defender,
[2565.48 - 2567.32] P:1867.41 E:0.099756 |  and you, you know, kick the ball,
[2568.04 - 2569.08] P:1891.40 E:0.105355 |  play through the ball,
[2569.08 - 2571.24] P:1780.45 E:0.095704 |  you can't stop your foot from them following through,
[2571.72 - 2574.44] P:1792.64 E:0.094528 |  and they've just caught Messi on the shin pad,
[2574.44 - 2576.76] P:1761.80 E:0.105428 |  and if he's wearing shin bands then it's probably Cicero.
[2578.04 - 2579.08] P:1544.68 E:0.113401 |  But he's up to his feets,
[2579.80 - 2581.32] P:1174.74 E:0.111639 |  Argentina's goal scorer,
[2581.88 - 2583.64] P:1291.66 E:0.096854 |  as he so often is,
[2585.32 - 2587.32] P:1334.78 E:0.106533 |  and that is why they have this slender lead,
[2587.32 - 2588.76] P:1431.75 E:0.084591 |  as Ottenendee,
[2588.76 - 2590.84] P:1285.78 E:0.084356 |  centered all the way back to Emil Martinez.
[2591.72 - 2593.32] P:1236.96 E:0.104741 |  Australia closing down again,
[2593.32 - 2593.96] P:1353.85 E:0.086538 |  once again,
[2593.96 - 2596.28] P:1445.11 E:0.068365 |  they're hunting impacts as they play
[2597.48 - 2599.00] P:1598.26 E:0.103800 |  around the Argentina,
[2599.00 - 2601.40] P:1578.97 E:0.083483 |  Papugomez though well pressured by Behich,
[2601.40 - 2604.28] P:1668.98 E:0.091465 |  and Dupro now trying close down,
[2604.28 - 2606.04] P:1519.63 E:0.088604 |  helps up towards the half by line,
[2606.04 - 2608.20] P:1815.02 E:0.093189 |  Rolls wins the header for Australia,
[2608.20 - 2610.20] P:1448.09 E:0.080993 |  and Suter will send it out to the right-hand side,
[2610.28 - 2612.92] P:1731.31 E:0.094456 |  and Deghanek all the way back to Matt Ryan,
[2612.92 - 2614.04] P:1552.73 E:0.118030 |  Argentina lead 1-0.
[2614.60 - 2617.08] P:1699.46 E:0.110492 |  Just wonder sometimes who messes legs does it take,
[2617.08 - 2619.32] P:1603.28 E:0.107041 |  20 minutes at his age to warm up a bit,
[2619.32 - 2622.20] P:1720.58 E:0.102708 |  you know, and they started moving a little bit more now,
[2622.20 - 2623.64] P:1708.31 E:0.104713 |  they were, he was walking beforehand,
[2623.64 - 2624.44] P:1727.98 E:0.084873 |  he wasn't,
[2624.44 - 2625.96] P:1695.47 E:0.110101 |  they were 20 minutes walking around,
[2625.96 - 2627.08] P:1540.23 E:0.109135 |  seeing what the game looked like,
[2627.08 - 2628.68] P:1660.65 E:0.093218 |  there are players that can do that.
[2628.68 - 2630.12] P:1455.13 E:0.107423 |  Good header by Jackson Irvine,
[2630.12 - 2631.64] P:1416.78 E:0.097161 |  little 1-2 with Mitchell Duke,
[2632.60 - 2636.36] P:1345.16 E:0.101969 |  with Australia having just inside their own heart,
[2636.36 - 2637.00] P:1279.83 E:0.105555 |  Aaron Moyes,
[2637.00 - 2638.44] P:1469.41 E:0.103233 |  sends it out to the right-hand side,
[2638.52 - 2640.60] P:1500.46 E:0.095270 |  Deghanek in an advanced position,
[2640.60 - 2642.68] P:1437.87 E:0.105849 |  almost because I have the ball there,
[2642.68 - 2644.12] P:1469.40 E:0.109192 |  and he's been dispossessed well,
[2644.12 - 2646.44] P:1545.69 E:0.095613 |  back is coming across to try and help out,
[2646.44 - 2647.40] P:1247.63 E:0.078311 |  and does get a fit on it,
[2647.40 - 2650.52] P:1535.62 E:0.098104 |  but it's calmly played away by Otamendi,
[2650.52 - 2653.56] P:1729.67 E:0.102573 |  and Argentina will work it very calmly
[2653.56 - 2654.76] P:1740.17 E:0.099585 |  between that back line,
[2654.76 - 2656.92] P:1671.22 E:0.100190 |  and pick it up outside their own penalty area,
[2656.92 - 2658.68] P:1605.57 E:0.083607 |  with Enzo Fernandez.
[2658.68 - 2660.60] P:1519.79 E:0.084639 |  I think what you were saying earlier,
[2660.60 - 2663.32] P:1388.48 E:0.089212 |  Pat, about Messi providing that magic spark,
[2663.32 - 2666.04] P:1635.97 E:0.074180 |  and Argentina course,
[2666.92 - 2668.44] P:1556.88 E:0.106800 |  having him at the heart of everything,
[2668.44 - 2671.96] P:1626.62 E:0.095033 |  but they have had the goals coming from elsewhere,
[2671.96 - 2673.32] P:1386.90 E:0.097613 |  yes, he scored 3,
[2673.32 - 2673.96] P:1443.71 E:0.102493 |  it would have been 4,
[2673.96 - 2676.12] P:1462.45 E:0.095278 |  had he not missed the penalty against Poland,
[2676.12 - 2678.52] P:1384.20 E:0.109411 |  but we've seen Alexis McAllister get his first goal,
[2679.08 - 2680.36] P:1404.47 E:0.112052 |  Julian Alvarez as well,
[2680.36 - 2682.84] P:1342.34 E:0.101286 |  lovely piece of skill from Enzo Fernandez,
[2682.84 - 2685.24] P:1566.97 E:0.096042 |  they have managed to find the goals,
[2685.24 - 2687.40] P:1352.92 E:0.102399 |  and the good pieces of play as well from elsewhere,
[2687.40 - 2690.52] P:1112.20 E:0.097228 |  although obviously missing so often integral to those moves.
[2690.52 - 2692.76] P:1367.63 E:0.102911 |  It's a good thing as they've got a little bit back up as well,
[2692.76 - 2695.72] P:1517.14 E:0.100501 |  remember they've not got Angel to mid-air on the pitch just now,
[2696.04 - 2697.88] P:1403.65 E:0.105703 |  and they have got a lot of back up,
[2697.88 - 2700.28] P:1565.74 E:0.102195 |  and that's why a lot of people are seeing them
[2700.28 - 2702.52] P:1410.56 E:0.100029 |  as a real challenge after this competition,
[2702.52 - 2704.36] P:1639.68 E:0.099171 |  but let's be fair, for half an hour,
[2704.36 - 2705.80] P:1494.18 E:0.091795 |  it looked nothing like that,
[2705.80 - 2708.76] P:1621.33 E:0.104343 |  they were so slow, it seemed a bit dull,
[2708.76 - 2710.76] P:1647.48 E:0.106374 |  there wasn't a great deal of imagination,
[2711.32 - 2713.80] P:1529.29 E:0.098298 |  but then Messi decided he'd had enough.
[2715.00 - 2716.36] P:1592.74 E:0.115313 |  And they have slowed it down again,
[2716.36 - 2719.00] P:1356.80 E:0.090904 |  but you can understand why when they have the one goal advantage,
[2719.00 - 2720.76] P:1546.52 E:0.096017 |  but as Behic lets that go out,
[2720.76 - 2722.84] P:1441.12 E:0.090007 |  as we take into the final minute of normal time,
[2723.72 - 2725.16] P:1694.78 E:0.111480 |  they've got to take warning, surely,
[2725.16 - 2726.60] P:1550.78 E:0.101092 |  from what happened against Saudi Arabia,
[2726.60 - 2728.12] P:1542.53 E:0.115901 |  because they were one enough at halftime,
[2728.12 - 2730.84] P:1512.10 E:0.113780 |  they had so many chances, three goals rolled out cross-eyed,
[2730.84 - 2732.84] P:1665.35 E:0.101317 |  they certainly haven't had that against Australia,
[2733.40 - 2736.36] P:1636.39 E:0.100392 |  but they know from bitter experience in this tournament,
[2736.36 - 2739.64] P:1406.11 E:0.093759 |  that no matter if a side is much lower rank than you,
[2739.64 - 2741.00] P:1422.06 E:0.115126 |  no matter if you've been all over them,
[2741.00 - 2744.28] P:1635.37 E:0.101634 |  which haven't against Australia, you're not safe.
[2744.28 - 2745.96] P:1565.39 E:0.116552 |  Well, you know, just see for the moment,
[2745.96 - 2748.60] P:1781.03 E:0.092414 |  just ask a huge number of teams,
[2748.60 - 2751.24] P:1633.47 E:0.102323 |  I think they've got the game, the points in the bag,
[2751.80 - 2753.64] P:1895.58 E:0.120296 |  you know, Uruguay last night,
[2753.64 - 2756.12] P:1825.83 E:0.113539 |  thought they were cruising away, now they didn't lose their game,
[2756.12 - 2758.76] P:1692.24 E:0.098448 |  but they went out because it didn't score enough,
[2758.76 - 2760.92] P:1524.47 E:0.099959 |  so, you know, nothing can be taken for granted.
[2761.48 - 2764.36] P:1761.40 E:0.096853 |  However, if Argentina did get a second goal at any point,
[2765.24 - 2767.48] P:1600.35 E:0.093079 |  that would be the proverbial mountain, I think.
[2768.28 - 2772.12] P:1247.96 E:0.096552 |  We're into two minutes of added time at the end of this first half,
[2772.12 - 2776.60] P:1502.95 E:0.082166 |  Messi's goal gives Argentina this slender lead.
[2776.60 - 2778.84] P:1526.27 E:0.096328 |  Australia have looked most dangerous from set pieces,
[2778.84 - 2781.00] P:1588.16 E:0.096504 |  but they're pinned in their own half at the moment,
[2781.08 - 2784.76] P:1730.14 E:0.096934 |  that's an Uruguay not able to work it forward,
[2784.76 - 2787.24] P:1526.94 E:0.097310 |  but they do win the throw off Rodrigo de Paul,
[2787.24 - 2789.56] P:1583.79 E:0.101572 |  but Ervon, he's been impressive so far, hasn't he?
[2789.56 - 2792.52] P:1479.66 E:0.094235 |  He's linked the play well, his vision,
[2792.52 - 2794.28] P:1334.67 E:0.104979 |  his ability to hold the ball up under pressure,
[2794.28 - 2797.40] P:1558.68 E:0.092528 |  and actually start very open counterattacks,
[2797.40 - 2800.28] P:1272.69 E:0.098293 |  he's been impressive for Australia so far,
[2800.28 - 2802.36] P:1420.02 E:0.099221 |  as they have it just outside their own penalty area.
[2802.36 - 2803.80] P:1663.81 E:0.109233 |  He's actually changed positions a wee bit,
[2803.80 - 2805.64] P:1452.97 E:0.103615 |  he's trying to move a little bit further to the left.
[2806.20 - 2808.28] P:1506.39 E:0.097789 |  And I'm trying to see if Australia,
[2808.36 - 2811.16] P:1463.13 E:0.099094 |  they've almost gone to 3-4-3 at the moment,
[2811.16 - 2812.68] P:1440.99 E:0.099893 |  but I think they may have adapted,
[2813.32 - 2816.28] P:1619.70 E:0.112274 |  because the Conceijaks and Avons come a little bit further over to the left,
[2816.28 - 2818.60] P:1695.67 E:0.093650 |  where it was he who was playing one of two strikers,
[2818.60 - 2821.24] P:1677.53 E:0.086932 |  so we should keep an eye on that just now.
[2821.80 - 2824.52] P:1375.09 E:0.097230 |  Yeah, Riley McGrise drifted a little more centrally,
[2825.56 - 2827.72] P:1413.30 E:0.104831 |  so a little bit of interchanging from Australia,
[2827.72 - 2831.00] P:1569.28 E:0.104462 |  who is Ervon out on the left-hand side,
[2831.00 - 2833.08] P:1903.64 E:0.105454 |  won't be kept in by Bejic,
[2833.08 - 2836.36] P:1975.59 E:0.099509 |  and the ball goes out of play for an Argentina throw.
[2836.36 - 2838.04] P:1859.57 E:0.103216 |  Yeah, just asking questions, well done.
[2838.12 - 2840.12] P:1732.74 E:0.089559 |  You know, don't be fearful.
[2840.12 - 2841.72] P:1700.27 E:0.116056 |  You know, if you're playing against Argentina,
[2841.72 - 2844.04] P:1323.78 E:0.098521 |  or if you're playing against Denmark, it doesn't matter.
[2844.04 - 2845.72] P:1448.02 E:0.100254 |  You have to go and win a game of football.
[2845.72 - 2848.60] P:1743.80 E:0.099463 |  So if your tactics aren't winning, you aren't creating anything,
[2848.60 - 2849.96] P:1370.20 E:0.109654 |  and they haven't really created much
[2849.96 - 2851.88] P:1654.48 E:0.094439 |  apart from getting those corner kicks,
[2851.88 - 2853.72] P:1436.99 E:0.115807 |  maybe you have to adapt a little bit
[2853.72 - 2854.68] P:1558.92 E:0.094901 |  and ask a different question.
[2854.68 - 2857.00] P:1268.66 E:0.111685 |  And I started to do that now in the last few minutes.
[2857.00 - 2859.24] P:1540.16 E:0.100010 |  They're hunting as a pack again, Australia.
[2859.24 - 2860.28] P:1250.75 E:0.109032 |  Every time they've done that,
[2860.28 - 2862.04] P:1389.66 E:0.092037 |  they've done it about five times in this match,
[2862.04 - 2862.76] P:1524.83 E:0.105022 |  it's worked.
[2862.76 - 2865.00] P:1269.89 E:0.090368 |  This time again, they haven't been able to hold onto the ball.
[2865.56 - 2868.04] P:1609.13 E:0.100741 |  But that is paying off, and they can't do it every single time,
[2868.04 - 2870.04] P:1776.99 E:0.099655 |  as they won't quite bring the ball down
[2870.04 - 2871.40] P:1517.33 E:0.103060 |  inside the penalty area,
[2871.40 - 2873.88] P:1547.98 E:0.109893 |  and Argentina will clear away.
[2873.88 - 2875.88] P:1654.11 E:0.114435 |  And there is the halftime whistle.
[2875.88 - 2879.00] P:1809.59 E:0.106018 |  Well, again, promise there for Australia,
[2879.00 - 2882.44] P:1748.59 E:0.103086 |  but the key man has got the key goal, Lionel Messi.
[2883.08 - 2886.12] P:1708.14 E:0.101898 |  The slender advantage for Argentina at the break
[2886.12 - 2890.44] P:1704.12 E:0.091034 |  on his 1,000th appearance for club and country.
[2890.44 - 2892.36] P:1597.73 E:0.094449 |  Of course, it was going to be him.
[2892.36 - 2894.92] P:1632.95 E:0.099135 |  It was another classic moment of Messi magic,
[2894.92 - 2897.32] P:1245.63 E:0.099120 |  lovely low finish into the corner,
[2897.32 - 2899.48] P:1418.63 E:0.097146 |  beautiful footwork inside the penalty area.
[2900.04 - 2903.40] P:1424.46 E:0.100502 |  And Argentina, although they have not been at their best,
[2903.40 - 2904.52] P:1240.99 E:0.082334 |  and that's an understatement,
[2905.08 - 2908.68] P:1489.83 E:0.095143 |  lead Australia in the last 16 by Goulton Hill at halftime.
[2909.80 - 2912.44] P:1579.00 E:0.115686 |  Vicky Sparks and Pat Nevin, thank you very much for now.
[2912.44 - 2915.40] P:1748.24 E:0.092078 |  Second half commentary to come, of course, with Argentina.
[2915.40 - 2918.04] P:1750.11 E:0.099283 |  Having that slender advantage at the break
[2918.04 - 2920.44] P:1884.69 E:0.086411 |  we've joined by Australia captain Mila Yedinak
[2920.44 - 2923.16] P:1897.41 E:0.081423 |  and South American football expert Tim Vickery.
[2923.16 - 2925.16] P:1959.01 E:0.101824 |  Tim, Lionel Messi in Argentina,
[2925.16 - 2927.80] P:1803.91 E:0.098331 |  and bear with me here, remind me of a crocodile.
[2927.80 - 2930.44] P:1826.36 E:0.095210 |  They sit there looking like they're just basking in the sun,
[2930.44 - 2932.68] P:1813.61 E:0.090519 |  but really they've got their eye open
[2932.68 - 2935.48] P:1794.39 E:0.096510 |  and they're aware of their prey all around them.
[2935.48 - 2937.48] P:1838.36 E:0.079401 |  And when the time is right, they pounce.
[2939.00 - 2941.24] P:1549.95 E:0.112997 |  What are you going to do with a lunatic like that on the field?
[2941.96 - 2944.92] P:1878.25 E:0.092722 |  The referee blew his whistle, and for a while you thought,
[2944.92 - 2947.08] P:1764.06 E:0.082886 |  yeah, this game is going to be good when it starts, won't it?
[2948.04 - 2950.12] P:1899.71 E:0.089676 |  Which was full credit to Australia.
[2950.76 - 2953.24] P:1783.67 E:0.112606 |  I love the way that they don't defend too deep,
[2954.44 - 2958.52] P:1883.04 E:0.094710 |  and they play as a unit, and when they could,
[2958.52 - 2962.36] P:1754.20 E:0.098388 |  they got up the field as a unit without creating too much.
[2962.92 - 2966.12] P:1868.51 E:0.097591 |  And you looked at the Argentina side without Di Maria.
[2966.12 - 2970.60] P:1998.23 E:0.086654 |  It's all passing in front of Australia.
[2970.60 - 2975.40] P:1915.16 E:0.095433 |  It looks so slow, and as my old man would have said,
[2975.40 - 2977.80] P:1765.61 E:0.107638 |  the team looked like it needed a collective stick of dynamite
[2977.80 - 2978.92] P:1831.80 E:0.106573 |  up where the sun don't shine.
[2979.80 - 2981.56] P:1817.75 E:0.124866 |  And one moment of...
[2981.56 - 2985.08] P:1830.37 E:0.096370 |  It's the only time that they've moved the ball quickly,
[2985.96 - 2990.20] P:1992.41 E:0.093894 |  close to the Australia goal, and it divides the teams.
[2990.20 - 2992.20] P:1876.75 E:0.100744 |  And even the shot from Messi,
[2992.20 - 2996.36] P:1936.04 E:0.102856 |  he makes football just look so ridiculously easy.
[2996.36 - 2998.84] P:1793.97 E:0.098342 |  It's almost as if that left foot, he just picked it up
[2998.84 - 3001.88] P:1727.72 E:0.110327 |  with his hand and placed it beyond the goalkeeper
[3001.88 - 3002.76] P:1292.62 E:0.115610 |  into the far corner.
[3002.76 - 3004.12] P:1723.83 E:0.111301 |  Sometimes you watch this man play,
[3004.12 - 3008.28] P:1715.87 E:0.099223 |  and they pass him a brick and he builds a house with it.
[3008.28 - 3012.68] P:1734.22 E:0.096776 |  So he's the difference, and I'm very intrigued
[3012.68 - 3015.56] P:1546.44 E:0.105843 |  to see what Australia are going to do about this in the second half.
[3016.44 - 3018.84] P:1732.86 E:0.101229 |  And that's what's going to be fascinating to see, Mele,
[3018.84 - 3020.76] P:1755.64 E:0.098121 |  because Australia, as Tim was saying,
[3020.76 - 3023.00] P:1806.91 E:0.090444 |  and as Pat and Vicky have been saying in commentary,
[3023.80 - 3025.64] P:1787.82 E:0.094929 |  and you said as you joined them,
[3025.64 - 3030.76] P:1817.24 E:0.089159 |  Australia have done so well in containing this Argentina side
[3030.76 - 3033.72] P:1782.56 E:0.089486 |  until a moment of messy magic.
[3033.72 - 3034.60] P:1691.85 E:0.109265 |  What do they do now?
[3034.60 - 3037.40] P:1737.36 E:0.092123 |  Because the temptation is they're going to have to come out
[3037.40 - 3041.32] P:1803.76 E:0.088806 |  and give Argentina a bit more space that they were denying them.
[3041.32 - 3042.12] P:1669.80 E:0.107391 |  Yeah, absolutely.
[3042.12 - 3043.56] P:1448.57 E:0.091393 |  I think you're spot on.
[3043.56 - 3046.20] P:1709.99 E:0.103534 |  Obviously, conceding the goal in the manner we did,
[3046.20 - 3048.36] P:1762.00 E:0.097353 |  more so than the man who scored it.
[3048.36 - 3051.32] P:1571.42 E:0.102248 |  We know all the ability and what he's got at his feet,
[3051.32 - 3053.64] P:1727.54 E:0.088360 |  but I just think the incident beforehand,
[3053.64 - 3055.80] P:1478.94 E:0.092526 |  when Beech and him have a little tussle,
[3055.80 - 3058.28] P:1662.02 E:0.093228 |  but Aziz doesn't really hold his head.
[3058.28 - 3060.84] P:1725.47 E:0.093785 |  It's a lapse in concentration and a rash decision,
[3060.84 - 3062.84] P:1484.34 E:0.094650 |  which allows Argentina in.
[3064.04 - 3065.32] P:1729.59 E:0.095712 |  Do they change their approach?
[3065.32 - 3066.84] P:1407.41 E:0.097296 |  They'll take heart from the first half
[3066.84 - 3070.04] P:1755.39 E:0.084268 |  because of the way that they built into the game,
[3070.04 - 3072.52] P:1737.06 E:0.095518 |  and Argentina didn't have too many chances.
[3072.52 - 3075.08] P:1784.13 E:0.091525 |  Listen, I know Argentina's probably played a little bit
[3075.08 - 3076.92] P:1579.09 E:0.101976 |  within themselves and rightly so,
[3076.92 - 3079.24] P:1841.55 E:0.077132 |  but Australia's got to take heart from that,
[3079.24 - 3082.68] P:1640.23 E:0.098190 |  and ultimately now they do have to go and pick their opportunities
[3082.68 - 3084.44] P:1544.37 E:0.102607 |  and do it more frequently in this second half.
[3087.08 - 3091.08] P:1839.52 E:0.096865 |  It has been a difficult goal to take for Australia,
[3091.08 - 3093.48] P:1661.62 E:0.083377 |  but on that moment beforehand, Tim,
[3093.48 - 3096.76] P:1936.95 E:0.092923 |  do you think Messi's used that tussle on the touchline
[3096.76 - 3098.84] P:1981.12 E:0.083764 |  to just kind of fire him up?
[3100.28 - 3101.56] P:1779.18 E:0.084733 |  Perhaps, perhaps.
[3102.52 - 3107.08] P:1411.28 E:0.108063 |  I'm absorbing at the moment your crocodile comparison
[3108.44 - 3110.84] P:1710.88 E:0.114369 |  that they used him for a lot of the game right up front.
[3110.84 - 3112.28] P:1707.86 E:0.100620 |  You can rate out of 10 if you like.
[3114.92 - 3115.96] P:1853.19 E:0.116099 |  I'll take a last score.
[3116.84 - 3121.16] P:1469.94 E:0.115457 |  Gomez playing one side and Alvin is playing the other side,
[3121.88 - 3125.88] P:1640.22 E:0.112294 |  and Messi, if he doesn't like the look of the ball that's played up,
[3125.88 - 3127.24] P:2159.04 E:0.119516 |  you know, he just shrugs his shoulders.
[3127.24 - 3128.52] P:1875.34 E:0.095059 |  He's not going to do a lot.
[3128.52 - 3129.80] P:1666.66 E:0.110609 |  He's certainly not going to press.
[3130.84 - 3134.04] P:1697.06 E:0.104843 |  He's not going to put the Australian centre-backs under pressure
[3134.04 - 3136.52] P:1742.62 E:0.099830 |  as they look to play the ball out.
[3136.52 - 3140.12] P:1783.86 E:0.105767 |  So that's Messi with the hooded eye half closed,
[3140.68 - 3142.44] P:1725.86 E:0.113016 |  but he's always looking for his opportunity.
[3143.16 - 3148.28] P:1827.83 E:0.096204 |  And the worry now for Australia is space will open up, won't it?
[3148.44 - 3151.40] P:1849.21 E:0.098579 |  First, because of tiredness, it always does.
[3151.40 - 3153.72] P:1567.76 E:0.111615 |  And secondly, because of the circumstance of the game,
[3153.72 - 3155.32] P:1971.96 E:0.074220 |  they've got to chase it.
[3155.32 - 3159.16] P:1815.92 E:0.109500 |  So Argentina, I would imagine at half-time,
[3159.16 - 3162.20] P:1829.57 E:0.079430 |  will be saying, come on, let's put this one to bed.
[3162.20 - 3165.16] P:1929.81 E:0.102244 |  Let's not give them a chance in the game.
[3165.72 - 3169.72] P:1896.27 E:0.093943 |  So I'd imagine that Argentina will come out second half,
[3169.72 - 3173.40] P:1977.70 E:0.098332 |  looking either to retain the ball as much as possible
[3173.40 - 3175.72] P:1758.17 E:0.096244 |  and run the legs off Australia,
[3175.80 - 3179.64] P:1983.98 E:0.075763 |  or if they draw Australia forward, exploit that space
[3179.64 - 3183.00] P:1823.85 E:0.093744 |  to launch some counters, get into space between the defence
[3183.00 - 3185.64] P:1866.56 E:0.095243 |  and the midfield and try and have some fun there.
[3185.64 - 3189.08] P:1753.45 E:0.081039 |  And, well, the true test of a team always, isn't it,
[3189.08 - 3190.52] P:1641.79 E:0.108355 |  is when you go a goal down.
[3190.52 - 3193.72] P:1866.51 E:0.092795 |  And the only time that Australia have been in that situation,
[3193.72 - 3195.96] P:2009.08 E:0.093937 |  chasing the game, was against France,
[3195.96 - 3199.00] P:1770.56 E:0.101001 |  when admittedly against unbelievable French talent,
[3199.00 - 3200.28] P:1853.31 E:0.085399 |  they took a shellacking.
[3200.28 - 3202.12] P:1754.19 E:0.112659 |  So Argentina will be thinking, well,
[3202.12 - 3203.72] P:1959.22 E:0.083872 |  France gave them a shellacking.
[3203.72 - 3204.84] P:1674.60 E:0.103807 |  Let's see if we can do the same.
[3206.04 - 3208.36] P:1750.44 E:0.115524 |  Tim Vickery and Mille Edinac with us,
[3208.36 - 3209.64] P:1655.40 E:0.082852 |  will be back for the second half,
[3209.64 - 3211.56] P:1914.19 E:0.075188 |  and we'll try and make it snappy.
[3211.56 - 3213.08] P:1739.61 E:0.122566 |  On social media, Dan said,
[3213.08 - 3215.72] P:1833.82 E:0.078669 |  had to be Messi's course with the first real chance,
[3215.72 - 3217.64] P:1791.68 E:0.105281 |  given that space, and he will punish you.
[3217.64 - 3221.40] P:1940.27 E:0.094455 |  Paul says, Messi's first goal in a World Cup knockout game
[3221.40 - 3223.56] P:1866.19 E:0.097939 |  in the 1,000th match of his career,
[3223.56 - 3226.36] P:1937.48 E:0.082086 |  written in the stars, and Stuart says,
[3226.36 - 3229.64] P:1772.19 E:0.091907 |  imagine having those Argentinian fans behind you.
[3229.64 - 3231.16] P:1807.29 E:0.101554 |  Absolutely phenomenal,
[3231.16 - 3233.80] P:1913.40 E:0.081066 |  as they have been throughout this competition.
[3233.80 - 3235.80] P:1803.38 E:0.076690 |  We will be back for the second half,
[3235.80 - 3237.64] P:1761.71 E:0.084711 |  after the BBC News with Karl Hartley.
[3238.28 - 3241.64] P:1389.75 E:0.122349 |  Take the World Cup with you, Qatar 2022.
[3241.64 - 3246.36] P:1534.59 E:0.117645 |  On BBC Sounds, this is BBC Radio 5 Live.
[3246.36 - 3249.16] P:1191.80 E:0.093073 |  Messages of support are being sent to Palet,
[3249.16 - 3251.48] P:1401.81 E:0.095069 |  after a Brazilian newspaper reported
[3251.48 - 3255.08] P:1576.13 E:0.077326 |  the football legend is being given end of life care.
[3255.08 - 3258.92] P:1618.39 E:0.082105 |  The 82-year-old was admitted to hospital earlier this week.
[3258.92 - 3261.08] P:1414.44 E:0.082160 |  The latest unconfirmed reports say
[3261.16 - 3264.04] P:1348.68 E:0.083275 |  he's no longer responding to chemotherapy.
[3264.84 - 3267.00] P:1468.79 E:0.090289 |  A supporter has died after becoming ill
[3267.00 - 3270.76] P:1518.07 E:0.086719 |  at a national league game between Bromley and Joval.

[3386.52 - 3388.04] P:1990.22 E:0.102893 |  in 10 minutes time or so,
[3388.04 - 3390.36] P:1985.87 E:0.097586 |  as Lionel Messi has scored his first goal
[3390.36 - 3392.28] P:1939.95 E:0.096634 |  in the knockout stages of the World Cup.

[3396.52 - 3398.60] P:2017.77 E:0.095809 |  And in fact, the song that you can hear,
[3398.60 - 3401.96] P:1992.68 E:0.101199 |  the Argentina fans singing all around the ground,
[3401.96 - 3404.84] P:2051.71 E:0.087272 |  they've been extremely vocal throughout this competition,
[3404.84 - 3407.88] P:1936.81 E:0.103410 |  is about the land of Diego and Lionel.
[3407.88 - 3410.44] P:2051.88 E:0.094414 |  They talk about the history of their side
[3410.44 - 3413.00] P:1887.60 E:0.100101 |  and how Diego Maradona is watching on,
[3413.00 - 3417.16] P:1927.77 E:0.085411 |  and he will have watched as Lionel Messi goes past his World Cup total.
[3417.16 - 3419.96] P:1935.91 E:0.093187 |  Second half of that one coming up very shortly.
[3419.96 - 3422.68] P:1944.22 E:0.108183 |  England against Senegal is live on Five Live tomorrow.
[3422.68 - 3426.12] P:2027.47 E:0.089488 |  The best build-up guests and analysis will be right here.
[3426.12 - 3428.76] P:1975.48 E:0.093152 |  There is a lot of noise around Phil Foden
[3428.76 - 3431.96] P:1932.37 E:0.104075 |  and whether or not he'll start after he played so well against Wales
[3431.96 - 3434.60] P:1993.32 E:0.083425 |  and scored, he's been speaking to Kelly Summers
[3434.60 - 3438.36] P:2044.97 E:0.086507 |  about his so far fifth part role at the World Cup.
[3438.36 - 3440.28] P:1737.58 E:0.090379 |  Obviously, I'm disappointed not to start more games,
[3440.28 - 3442.36] P:970.50 E:0.077132 |  but it's a part of the tournament.
[3443.00 - 3446.12] P:1439.30 E:0.087414 |  I'm a team player, so I just want to keep working hard,
[3446.12 - 3449.24] P:1490.94 E:0.090003 |  and when I get the opportunities, I'm just going to try and take them.
[3449.24 - 3452.12] P:1233.87 E:0.091816 |  Going into Tuesday's game, there was a lot of talk about you.
[3452.12 - 3455.32] P:1201.08 E:0.087482 |  People were desperate to see you start in an England shirt.
[3455.32 - 3458.84] P:1009.98 E:0.080606 |  How aware were you of all of that noise, and what did you make of it?
[3458.84 - 3461.16] P:1652.85 E:0.102706 |  Yeah, obviously, I see a lot of media attention
[3461.24 - 3465.72] P:1359.09 E:0.079453 |  towards me to start. It's hard to get away from that.
[3466.68 - 3470.84] P:1347.85 E:0.095254 |  But like I said, me being me, I just like to keep my head down.
[3470.84 - 3474.28] P:1565.73 E:0.087567 |  And when I get the opportunity to try and not to overthink things,
[3474.28 - 3477.08] P:1290.86 E:0.082697 |  just play our normally play and play my football.
[3477.08 - 3479.64] P:1231.47 E:0.085763 |  Does the manager talk to you during periods like that?
[3479.64 - 3482.20] P:1239.58 E:0.085129 |  Was he telling you you are going to get this opportunity?
[3482.20 - 3484.44] P:860.06 E:0.077243 |  Was it part of a wider plan from him, do you think?
[3484.44 - 3487.24] P:1433.42 E:0.097108 |  Yeah, he said to all the attackers that we're all going to get our chance.
[3487.24 - 3489.00] P:1256.12 E:0.090406 |  And I think we've all played now.
[3489.72 - 3492.92] P:1230.02 E:0.066733 |  So yeah, we just have to be ready. Whoever starts,
[3492.92 - 3495.88] P:1667.43 E:0.096436 |  the bench is just so strong and ready to change the game.
[3495.88 - 3497.72] P:1604.91 E:0.092061 |  Did you speak to Jack Grealish about it at all?
[3497.72 - 3502.12] P:1307.54 E:0.085215 |  Because a year or so ago at the Euros, everyone was desperate to see Jack Grealish.
[3502.12 - 3505.00] P:1312.52 E:0.090202 |  And it feels like this year you're the player that everyone wants to see.
[3505.00 - 3509.32] P:1336.67 E:0.086937 |  I think it happens. Like I said, he got the Euros.
[3510.60 - 3515.24] P:1239.47 E:0.077730 |  We just have to keep our feet off the ground and just keep working hard.
[3515.24 - 3517.16] P:1485.42 E:0.108620 |  And when we get the opportunity, we have to take it.
[3517.80 - 3519.72] P:1317.63 E:0.074180 |  And that's all it is really.
[3519.72 - 3522.04] P:1354.03 E:0.068213 |  Did it give you added motivation on Tuesday?
[3522.04 - 3525.24] P:1408.14 E:0.094357 |  It did, but a little bit more pressure as well at the same time.
[3526.36 - 3528.36] P:1272.66 E:0.075933 |  As a player, do you like that pressure?
[3528.36 - 3530.28] P:1498.94 E:0.106515 |  I do like it. Yeah, they're the games you want to play.
[3530.28 - 3533.24] P:1431.88 E:0.093108 |  And when everyone's talking about you and everyone's watching,
[3533.24 - 3536.60] P:1359.66 E:0.096310 |  you want to prove people wrong and prove people right at the same times.
[3536.60 - 3537.24] P:932.50 E:0.060552 |  So yeah.
[3537.24 - 3539.00] P:1396.12 E:0.088176 |  I guess you've also had to be patient.
[3539.00 - 3541.48] P:895.66 E:0.086647 |  Is that something that you've kind of had to get used to,
[3541.48 - 3543.24] P:1119.72 E:0.081601 |  or you've trained yourself to get used to,
[3543.24 - 3545.72] P:1311.79 E:0.084401 |  given how your manager at your club likes to operate,
[3545.72 - 3548.52] P:885.25 E:0.071407 |  because you do get rotated quite a bit at Manchester City too.
[3548.52 - 3551.16] P:1201.46 E:0.112431 |  Yeah, I'm used to that at my club, getting rotated a lot.
[3551.16 - 3555.48] P:1376.75 E:0.089753 |  And I didn't come here thinking, I'm just going to walk into the team.
[3555.48 - 3558.36] P:1090.37 E:0.091812 |  I know how good the players are and there's a lot of quality.
[3558.36 - 3562.36] P:1446.63 E:0.099143 |  So I knew in training, I'd have to show my quality and work hard.
[3563.24 - 3566.04] P:1425.88 E:0.094592 |  And that's just what I try and do really, just try my best all the time.
[3566.04 - 3567.96] P:1308.88 E:0.065205 |  What would you say your best position is?
[3567.96 - 3568.60] P:1203.27 E:0.102715 |  I don't even know.
[3569.48 - 3569.96] P:1210.81 E:0.128712 |  Everywhere.
[3570.92 - 3576.60] P:1437.00 E:0.086020 |  No, I mean, like probably anywhere on the wings or a number 10 role, for sure.
[3577.16 - 3578.20] P:1122.75 E:0.081193 |  Any of them free.
[3578.20 - 3581.80] P:924.79 E:0.090384 |  There's a lot of players like yourself in terms of players that can play out wide,
[3581.80 - 3583.80] P:958.24 E:0.087073 |  can play in that number 10 role as well.
[3583.80 - 3588.28] P:983.92 E:0.089433 |  Eight of England's nine goals so far have been scored by players that can play out wide.
[3588.28 - 3590.84] P:1300.19 E:0.069929 |  How do you assess the competition in that area of the pitch?
[3590.84 - 3591.64] P:885.68 E:0.116306 |  I mean, there's a lot.
[3592.52 - 3595.08] P:1473.74 E:0.090389 |  You know, Saka did well, the first game scoring.
[3595.88 - 3598.04] P:1545.74 E:0.101190 |  Rashford did well when he came, when he scored as well.
[3598.04 - 3599.80] P:1282.19 E:0.096954 |  And obviously he did very well against Wales.
[3601.32 - 3604.20] P:1271.06 E:0.103045 |  So, you know, like I said, everyone scored and everyone's proved the point.
[3604.20 - 3608.44] P:1556.97 E:0.075742 |  So it's going to be a headache for Gareth to pick the team for the next game.
[3611.24 - 3616.04] P:1795.95 E:0.101531 |  That was an interview with Kelly Summers talking to Phil Foden there about England's
[3616.04 - 3620.52] P:1921.08 E:0.088671 |  potential team selection for their game against Senegal, which you can hear commentary of on
[3620.52 - 3621.40] P:1764.99 E:0.082216 |  Five Lives Sports.
[3621.40 - 3624.76] P:1928.46 E:0.082182 |  Seven o'clock kickoff for that one in their last 16 match.
[3624.76 - 3627.88] P:1925.35 E:0.101835 |  I'm just slightly distracted because we've had the halftime entertainment.
[3627.88 - 3631.96] P:1787.44 E:0.096512 |  There's going to be musical interludes throughout the rest of this competition.
[3631.96 - 3635.72] P:1754.06 E:0.090208 |  This time it was Republica, the lead singer from Republica, singing ready to go.
[3635.72 - 3639.24] P:1843.28 E:0.098829 |  But she was only on her own on the touch line standing with a microphone,
[3639.24 - 3640.20] P:1790.93 E:0.087463 |  trying to get the crowd going.
[3640.20 - 3643.00] P:1853.79 E:0.089911 |  But most of them have gone off for halftime snacks.
[3643.00 - 3648.20] P:1863.65 E:0.085312 |  But an excellent performance, she sounded in a fine voice here inside the Ahmed bin Ali stadium.
[3648.20 - 3650.92] P:1623.90 E:0.091752 |  Emilio Yedanaka is with us.
[3650.92 - 3653.48] P:1812.15 E:0.073862 |  We'll be getting his thoughts on this after the game as well,
[3653.48 - 3656.28] P:1822.55 E:0.099855 |  with Australia training Argentina by a goal to nil.
[3656.28 - 3659.72] P:1764.30 E:0.092826 |  In the WSL, the leaders Chelsea maintained their impressive run.
[3659.72 - 3662.12] P:1802.90 E:0.083743 |  They beat bottomside Leicester 8-0.
[3662.12 - 3666.44] P:1708.39 E:0.085855 |  Elsewhere Manchester United scored 5 without a play against Aston Villa.
[3666.44 - 3670.60] P:1731.23 E:0.082894 |  And Arsenal beat Everton 1-0 to keep up the place in the title race.
[3670.60 - 3675.08] P:1743.40 E:0.098471 |  In the championship, Sunderland won 3-0 at home to Millwall to move them to within a point of the top
[3675.08 - 3675.72] P:2033.30 E:0.056075 |  6.
[3675.72 - 3680.36] P:1833.05 E:0.090697 |  Late wickets gave England the edge on day 3 of the opening test against Pakistan in Ralpindi.
[3680.36 - 3686.04] P:1878.41 E:0.089784 |  The host closed on 499 for 7, trailing England by 158 runs.
[3686.04 - 3692.20] P:1903.31 E:0.089220 |  Pakistan had 3 centurions today but 4 wickets in the final session have opened the door for England.
[3692.20 - 3698.92] P:1895.40 E:0.088073 |  In rugby union London Irish moved off the bottom of the premiership with a 39-17 win over Newcastle Falkens.
[3698.92 - 3703.96] P:1748.42 E:0.094569 |  And after unconfirmed reports from Brazil have said that he is now beginning end of life care
[3703.96 - 3709.00] P:1839.77 E:0.084829 |  after not responding to chemotherapy, former German international Jürgen Klinsmann
[3709.00 - 3715.56] P:1784.34 E:0.082888 |  and former Argentina international Pablo Zaballeta have given to Pele their messages of support.
[3715.56 - 3718.76] P:1346.39 E:0.086010 |  Very sun-used to hear about Pele.
[3718.76 - 3723.08] P:1407.69 E:0.087432 |  He's been a true inspiration for all of us, you know, on and off the pitch.
[3723.08 - 3730.36] P:1520.38 E:0.076864 |  He's always been a great man and what I would thought of with him tonight, his family.
[3730.36 - 3733.56] P:1535.34 E:0.067125 |  For me, he's the greatest footballer ever.
[3733.56 - 3736.60] P:1489.79 E:0.088909 |  I mean, what he's done, he won 3 World Cups, you know.
[3736.60 - 3742.84] P:1593.53 E:0.082658 |  He put Brazil on this map as a nation and football that we admire.
[3742.84 - 3747.64] P:1489.83 E:0.085588 |  We all in certain ways, we know fans of Brazilian football, he's the face for that.
[3747.64 - 3753.80] P:1792.47 E:0.074977 |  He's the face for Brazil so we just wish him to get better as quickly as possible.
[3753.80 - 3761.72] P:1950.49 E:0.086744 |  Some messages of support for Pele but they are unconfirmed reports that he is now beginning end of life care.
[3761.72 - 3767.08] P:1916.51 E:0.111983 |  Meanwhile here at the Asmead Ben Ali stadium the players are in the tunnel ready to come out for the second half Australia.
[3767.08 - 3770.28] P:1915.28 E:0.103211 |  Trailing Argentina by a Lionel Messi goal to nil.
[3770.28 - 3772.20] P:1997.79 E:0.094391 |  Mille Yedinak is with us.
[3772.20 - 3777.88] P:1874.28 E:0.093911 |  Mille, in terms of what Australia's approach was in the first half, it pretty much worked.
[3777.88 - 3782.60] P:1777.28 E:0.107252 |  Is it more of the same in the second or do they need to just be a little more front foot in their approach?
[3783.40 - 3787.08] P:1717.34 E:0.099470 |  Listen, I think it will be a little bit more of the same.
[3787.08 - 3791.56] P:1801.23 E:0.094487 |  Again, you want to stop this initial first 15-20 minutes, keep them quiet,
[3791.56 - 3798.28] P:1705.45 E:0.091825 |  keep them starved of opportunities in terms of the final third stuff but then there has to be a point where the trigger gets pulled
[3798.60 - 3801.40] P:1513.62 E:0.092984 |  and they start to commit bodies forward a little bit more on the front foot.
[3801.40 - 3805.64] P:1637.23 E:0.100176 |  A little bit to what was alluded in the commentary when they decided to go in those moments.
[3805.64 - 3813.64] P:1635.67 E:0.089109 |  They won the ball back and they won it back quite comfortably so it might be about just upping that a little bit and looking for those opportunities to present themselves.
[3814.28 - 3815.72] P:1896.00 E:0.108294 |  Mille, thank you very much for now.
[3815.72 - 3824.12] P:1859.06 E:0.100155 |  Mille Yedinak will be joining us at full time in this game and you can watch the match live on BBC television along with the Five Live commentary.
[3824.12 - 3831.48] P:1890.49 E:0.090964 |  Just search for World Cup Extra on the BBC iPlayer and taking you through the second half, Pat Nevin and Vicki Sparks.
[3833.48 - 3839.16] P:1712.94 E:0.094424 |  Thank you Kelly. So Argentina get us underway, leading by that Lionel Messi,
[3839.16 - 3847.56] P:1571.49 E:0.092617 |  goal to nil. No changes made by either side at halftime so Argentina playing from right to left in the blue and white striped shirts,
[3847.64 - 3853.96] P:1577.31 E:0.092466 |  the black shorts and the black socks Australia in the golden shirts, the green shorts and the white socks.
[3853.96 - 3859.00] P:1519.02 E:0.096529 |  Australia putting on the pressure immediately. Matthew Leckie challenging Officer Cunha
[3859.56 - 3865.72] P:1470.92 E:0.097538 |  and the ball goes out from Argentina throw deep in Argentina territory and it's a really fascinating one isn't it Pat?
[3865.72 - 3875.72] P:1444.53 E:0.091567 |  In terms of the tactical battle, I was at South Korea, Portugal yesterday, when for all the world South Korea looked like there was no way they were going to get the victory they needed in the second half.
[3876.12 - 3887.16] P:1817.29 E:0.096171 |  But they had a game plan, they stayed tight, they kept their shape, they knew they just needed one chance, they made the change in front of Anglicana Ruzon and in the end they got that one chance
[3887.72 - 3894.12] P:1736.93 E:0.097077 |  and they got the winner but they didn't change their approach because they knew they needed to keep Portugal at bay as well because there was no point in
[3894.92 - 3902.76] P:1464.78 E:0.094217 |  going gung-ho and losing the draw that they had at that point that they needed to build into a win as Argentina come forward through the centre,
[3902.84 - 3910.44] P:1474.37 E:0.091259 |  miss cue out to the left hand side will be collected by Acunha, sends it back into the second, into the Argentina half but that's it,
[3910.44 - 3917.56] P:1532.70 E:0.097888 |  Graham Arnold, he's got a plan, he'll have expected on short to go one-nil down at some point, well certainly would have had a plan for how to respond.
[3917.56 - 3927.96] P:1526.27 E:0.099638 |  Well, it was one shock, you know, and it was one of the things you have to take into account, you could go a bolder and specifically the goal from a specific person, go that bolder.
[3928.52 - 3931.96] P:1634.85 E:0.094780 |  What it would like to do is it would like to get the strengths of his team, you know,
[3932.76 - 3938.52] P:1626.06 E:0.092058 |  Duke is a good goal scorer, he's got lots of pace, he's good in the air, haven't been able to use him much yet.
[3939.00 - 3944.84] P:1597.65 E:0.099749 |  We know that Matthew Lech is good in the ball, we know that he's quite as a wiper, oh, a win chance there.
[3945.88 - 3953.96] P:1555.69 E:0.103071 |  Yes, Martinez charged down inside his own area, Argentina do manage to squeeze the ball out to the left hand side, they've won the throw as well
[3954.36 - 3960.28] P:1641.45 E:0.089944 |  but it's that press that Mili Edinac was just touching on there, they all went at the same time, he paid off
[3961.08 - 3963.08] P:1475.94 E:0.103061 |  and Argentina lucky to get away with that.
[3963.24 - 3970.12] P:1644.63 E:0.099192 |  It's so easy to say, well why don't you keep on high pressing, it's exhausting to do it all the time and if you get passed through
[3970.44 - 3976.12] P:1623.38 E:0.096649 |  you basically leave big gaps behind you, you don't want to do that, but I think Australia know that's the best chance they've got
[3976.52 - 3982.92] P:1415.37 E:0.097439 |  getting back in the ball and then winning either a goal, making a chance or else getting a free kick back up in that area.
[3983.80 - 3989.64] P:1513.51 E:0.091593 |  To some degree, I don't think the Argentinians win it too much because if they break the press, there's gaps.
[3990.60 - 3995.24] P:1322.29 E:0.106989 |  Here they come down the right hand side, Argentina the runners in the centre
[3996.12 - 4001.96] P:1210.89 E:0.098657 |  defending to do with the back foot, Bihic for Australia, keeps the shape well of that Australian back line so
[4002.44 - 4010.36] P:1149.87 E:0.098990 |  Argentina go all the way back to their gold scorer, their record gold scorer, their gold scorer tonight on his 1000th appearance for club and country.
[4011.32 - 4016.52] P:1373.77 E:0.101730 |  He's on the ball once more, 25 yards down, central position works into the left hand side and
[4016.84 - 4022.60] P:1064.57 E:0.101242 |  the Cunha, Argentina leading by a golden ilk, three minutes gone in the second half on five line
[4023.08 - 4029.80] P:1575.72 E:0.109139 |  and BBC Sam, here is Alexis McAllister, a Brighton, plays it back to Otter Mendy and he'll go all the way back to
[4030.44 - 4035.08] P:1500.65 E:0.109034 |  Christian Romero as the Argentina fans raise the noise once more
[4035.72 - 4041.24] P:1456.51 E:0.092331 |  inside the Acquins, Vinale Stadium, out to the right hand side, Argentina go
[4041.96 - 4049.16] P:1198.95 E:0.090247 |  in Australia, keeping their positions as they have done well throughout this game, just undone by the
[4050.28 - 4055.48] P:1173.85 E:0.097100 |  skill of Lionel Messi in that key moment, just passing the ball into the bottom corner,
[4056.04 - 4062.60] P:1282.52 E:0.090977 |  he makes it look oh so easy, 10 minutes before the break and that's why Argentina have the goal of advantage.
[4062.68 - 4066.28] P:1517.48 E:0.106387 |  Paul Bordeaux out on the right hand side, won't be kept in and Argentina
[4067.08 - 4070.44] P:1356.08 E:0.095243 |  four minutes into this game, four minutes into this second half I should say,
[4071.00 - 4073.88] P:1494.35 E:0.096476 |  are making a substitution, it is
[4074.60 - 4077.08] P:1667.07 E:0.108061 |  Nisandro Martinez who is coming on
[4079.00 - 4083.88] P:1645.73 E:0.105337 |  Alejandro Gomez who is coming off, so interesting one this, unusual to see
[4084.68 - 4092.28] P:1456.28 E:0.096495 |  a change made inside the first four minutes and I have to say I didn't see Gomez necessarily pick up a problem but
[4092.92 - 4098.92] P:1386.82 E:0.101440 |  he's walking around the edge of the pitch, interesting one that for us. Very unusual and more often than not
[4099.48 - 4103.08] P:1593.37 E:0.096365 |  it's a player who thinks he might have a little bit of a niggle and he said to the manager,
[4103.08 - 4108.04] P:1649.17 E:0.098669 |  let me give it a go for a few minutes and then said make some motion to say no I'm not right
[4108.76 - 4114.76] P:1714.96 E:0.100785 |  but to just tactically bring someone off after three minutes of second half, I mean how much can you do wrong in three minutes?
[4115.96 - 4118.68] P:1659.16 E:0.111924 |  Let's see what this means for Argentina's formation as well
[4119.40 - 4120.12] P:1529.09 E:0.097013 |  as
[4120.68 - 4125.80] P:1237.34 E:0.116216 |  Mesey plays the ball down the right hand side and Argentina getting the blue and white shirts
[4126.28 - 4130.68] P:1277.35 E:0.106801 |  into the penalty area, the ball is pulled across, will fall on the edge of the box
[4130.68 - 4135.88] P:1632.99 E:0.104560 |  to Mesey who drives the shot in, takes a little nick on the way through and bounces into the arms of Matt Ryan.
[4136.44 - 4138.76] P:1836.79 E:0.113598 |  Is that Mesey trying to go for a ball through the legs again?
[4139.24 - 4142.60] P:1857.21 E:0.098031 |  Because he's actually hit the legs of the player there, he was slightly slipping
[4143.24 - 4147.16] P:1663.91 E:0.102633 |  when he actually caught hold of the ball there so he just didn't actually can't shoot
[4147.72 - 4153.56] P:1693.55 E:0.102690 |  perfectly well but Mesey's beginning to find spaces now, as you see he walks about for long periods
[4154.12 - 4160.68] P:1679.07 E:0.099939 |  but he's taking on the game, he may well know that he can't run forever but what he's doing he's saying right okay where's the
[4161.32 - 4168.12] P:1588.90 E:0.100605 |  space developing and a very very few players at a very top level understand the game organically and he does.
[4168.76 - 4170.92] P:1281.85 E:0.112311 |  Here come Australia down the right hand side
[4171.64 - 4179.00] P:1256.61 E:0.097017 |  Mesey just slips at the key moment, the ball is out of play, the ball is over with Australia on the left hand side.
[4180.52 - 4184.36] P:1378.10 E:0.099469 |  Can you know what's a really strange thing, just looking at, we're talking to
[4184.92 - 4189.72] P:1444.57 E:0.103269 |  Osado half time now, he spotted the pitch, looks a lot a bit rough looking and he's ready, it does doesn't it?
[4190.36 - 4193.64] P:1451.45 E:0.096686 |  But the players are beginning to slip a lot as well and
[4194.44 - 4197.56] P:1504.12 E:0.101824 |  you know, the pitchers are always soaked
[4198.12 - 4202.20] P:1810.28 E:0.104818 |  but I'm not sure they've all got their A-stuns on just now and that may make a difference with the defenders.
[4203.32 - 4208.36] P:1513.67 E:0.103654 |  So Australia in possession, Lecky muscled out of it though, back is trying to do the same, two McAllister
[4209.48 - 4214.44] P:1476.41 E:0.108145 |  Argentina in the free kick on halfway, just looking at the way that they've been shuffled, it looks as though
[4214.52 - 4219.00] P:1302.40 E:0.096090 |  Argentina have gone to a back three here and that would make sense with Lissandro Martínez
[4219.40 - 4227.08] P:1314.50 E:0.101088 |  Manchester United coming on, of course he's a defender, Alejandro Gomez playing further forward, so a tactical switch, four minutes in.
[4228.12 - 4233.16] P:1569.93 E:0.099059 |  Do you know what surprises me though, that's fine if the opposition have made a tactical switch, you didn't see coming,
[4234.84 - 4239.16] P:1444.43 E:0.103977 |  they're almost exactly the same, the way the Australians are lining up against them, so
[4239.88 - 4243.48] P:1412.87 E:0.086814 |  again, yeah they've made the tactical switch but it's hard to see why.
[4245.64 - 4249.32] P:1546.96 E:0.108045 |  Good defending by Deghanek at the back for Australia, cleared away by Matt Bryant,
[4249.88 - 4253.32] P:1559.89 E:0.092707 |  get the height on it though and Argentina will bring it down
[4254.04 - 4259.80] P:1289.89 E:0.103442 |  with Enzo Fernandez, who stood for good anticipation by Harry Seater just stepping up out of his penalty area
[4260.36 - 4266.28] P:1467.56 E:0.109531 |  and the ball is out with my degree on the left hand side, Argentina will kick it up once more though,
[4266.36 - 4272.52] P:1387.67 E:0.092935 |  here is Alexis McAllister, out to a cunha on the left and he will go back to halfway. I think the other question is,
[4272.68 - 4279.00] P:1259.27 E:0.101746 |  what have you seen in the four minutes of the second half from Lionel Scoloni, the Argentina manager
[4279.64 - 4286.12] P:1477.33 E:0.109124 |  that means you employ that change four minutes in rather than half time, oh short back pass here in Mitchell Duke,
[4286.20 - 4293.56] P:1550.74 E:0.105755 |  almost in for Australia, Argentina out of nowhere, wants to get them playing themselves into real trouble inside their own penalty area,
[4293.80 - 4299.00] P:1344.41 E:0.098642 |  Emi Martinez comes out, cleared away for a throw, they're giving Australia hope here Pat.
[4299.16 - 4305.40] P:1571.11 E:0.097351 |  We have chances and you know at the leg they always can catch pigeons, they're chasing absolutely everything,
[4305.48 - 4313.40] P:1340.08 E:0.098254 |  but a long throw now, long throw by Degadec into the penalty area, a cunha should clear away and in the end very cleverly just leaves that ball
[4313.72 - 4317.40] P:1500.01 E:0.095768 |  to go out of play for Argentina, go kick their lead one-nil.
[4317.48 - 4319.80] P:1486.59 E:0.105974 |  To your point before about if you're going in the back three,
[4320.60 - 4324.84] P:1540.96 E:0.106417 |  people often think well that's you know a lot bit more negative, you're giving yourself a bit more cover,
[4325.40 - 4329.00] P:1582.54 E:0.103808 |  sometimes it's actually we want to get wingbacks fired up the pitch, you know that's what
[4329.48 - 4333.72] P:1560.04 E:0.104025 |  we know it can cause a lot of danger there, we can see a weakness in the opposition side
[4333.96 - 4337.64] P:1491.06 E:0.097401 |  if we play wingbacks and stretch the game a little bit, so it could be that,
[4338.20 - 4341.00] P:1389.15 E:0.098333 |  at the moment it's not clear why they've done it because it's not made any
[4341.48 - 4347.24] P:1478.98 E:0.095809 |  massive difference to the game, except it's got a lot of bits lacking the back and playing some very poor back passes.
[4348.28 - 4351.32] P:1396.70 E:0.110671 |  Inadvertent handball over on the far side by Riley McGrath,
[4351.80 - 4357.08] P:1244.19 E:0.098424 |  and Argentina will have a free kick just to the right of their penalty area, leading by a goal to next.
[4357.08 - 4361.24] P:1433.89 E:0.097192 |  So Argentina now with Emi Martinez in goal,
[4362.04 - 4366.60] P:1464.83 E:0.094772 |  the back three of Romero Martinez, the Sandro Martinez,
[4367.40 - 4370.52] P:1379.13 E:0.107838 |  and Otta Mendelio wingbacks, Alina Anacunha,
[4371.48 - 4378.60] P:1467.50 E:0.092854 |  ahead of them you have Alcaldes, Hernandez and De Paul, Messi, Alvarez,
[4379.16 - 4385.48] P:1436.55 E:0.108009 |  Messi sitting just behind Alvarez up front, so it is an interesting one for Argentina.
[4385.48 - 4389.16] P:1386.47 E:0.102931 |  Australia as you were as Australia win the free kick over on the far side,
[4389.16 - 4395.08] P:1311.97 E:0.095940 |  so Ryan in goal, the back four of Degeneck, Suta, Rolls of Bechich, ahead of them it's
[4395.64 - 4403.80] P:1725.28 E:0.097288 |  Lecky, Moy, Bacchus, and McGrath with Irvine and Mitchell-Jupain-Crumble, as we said in the first half,
[4403.80 - 4408.04] P:1430.17 E:0.092960 |  Jackson Irvine's been everywhere and at the moment it's Matthew Lecky, he's pushing up in that too,
[4408.04 - 4412.68] P:1443.85 E:0.103413 |  and Riley McGrath and Jackson Irvine and Matthew Lecky just interchanging a little bit,
[4413.48 - 4417.88] P:1342.01 E:0.102615 |  taking turns to go up alongside Mitchell-Jukey, doesn't have much to work with.
[4417.88 - 4423.16] P:1242.28 E:0.103708 |  Can Argentina work this down the left hand side? It was Alexis McAllister, Brighton,
[4423.16 - 4427.08] P:1284.84 E:0.105024 |  he's back to the halfway line and Nicholas Otta Mendelio,
[4427.08 - 4429.80] P:1213.00 E:0.105516 |  and the square at the top is Christian Romero.
[4430.92 - 4435.80] P:1612.62 E:0.104860 |  Just having a look at what they're thinking about doing, you know, they're going to change it,
[4435.80 - 4440.68] P:1557.23 E:0.094344 |  it's all the Australians because the moment, they are not creating anything themselves really,
[4441.80 - 4445.56] P:1568.77 E:0.098532 |  and if you look at the stats, I believe it is so far, Trotson target,
[4446.28 - 4449.72] P:1526.71 E:0.103444 |  Argentina won, that's too good now.
[4450.84 - 4455.48] P:1697.19 E:0.115133 |  And Argentina trying to get in behind here, Messi was chasing headed away by Ryan outside his
[4455.48 - 4461.32] P:1568.13 E:0.092656 |  penalty area, and those shots on target are also the score line, 1-0,
[4461.32 - 4464.44] P:1591.96 E:0.093966 |  and you know Messi's goal, 10 minutes before the game.
[4464.44 - 4468.12] P:1784.81 E:0.100961 |  Maybe it tells you something about the game, I don't know if I could be on a football,
[4468.12 - 4472.52] P:1821.11 E:0.105380 |  maybe I've got tens of thousands of people jumping about and screaming and singing all the way through it,
[4472.60 - 4475.96] P:1867.64 E:0.096019 |  and then you look at the stats and you think, well, you know, they could do well,
[4475.96 - 4481.40] P:1784.35 E:0.094332 |  it's not a lot about actually on the pitch. To be honest, I wouldn't put it much against the
[4481.40 - 4486.28] P:1716.94 E:0.090804 |  Australians, I think they're putting every bit of work in they've got, but the extra bit of sophistication
[4486.28 - 4489.32] P:1534.09 E:0.104837 |  you have, you need at this level, they've not really shown it yet, have they?
[4490.52 - 4495.40] P:1411.73 E:0.098087 |  So, Alessandro Martinez out to Christian Romero, just inside the Argentina half,

[4501.80 - 4508.04] P:1220.11 E:0.093115 |  Manchester City, out to the right-hand side, Argentina go once more, Alvarez will
[4508.04 - 4513.40] P:1284.18 E:0.095495 |  lift it out to the right once again, look for the return pass, it's well intercepted at the
[4513.40 - 4519.24] P:1336.11 E:0.089450 |  back by Rawls for Australia, Argentina will come again, put in by Backers, dispossessing the
[4519.24 - 4524.92] P:1709.53 E:0.096124 |  Caliser, and Ryan is out very quickly to pick that up, a few half-shouts, claiming for a back pass,
[4524.92 - 4530.12] P:1478.64 E:0.095658 |  but that was never going to happen, and Australia in possession, Argentina's turned to press inside
[4530.12 - 4534.68] P:1722.52 E:0.114547 |  their own penalty area, and Ryan's taking a real risk here, and Alvarez will score the seconds,
[4535.32 - 4543.08] P:1506.02 E:0.112695 |  Australia completely masters of their own downfall, and Julian Alvarez of Manchester City
[4543.64 - 4549.88] P:1519.90 E:0.106409 |  helps Argentina take another step towards the quarter-finals, and a match up with the Netherlands,
[4549.88 - 4556.84] P:1569.13 E:0.107483 |  and Australia, all they can do is shake their heads and look at each other, it's a shocking mistake
[4556.84 - 4563.48] P:1527.52 E:0.101256 |  by Ryan, it's Argentina to Australian Hill. Do you know that's been coming a little bit
[4564.52 - 4569.80] P:1650.65 E:0.104999 |  Ryan, you know, good goalkeeper in many ways, he's not comfortable with the ball at his feet,
[4569.80 - 4574.28] P:1772.54 E:0.105046 |  and if you're not comfortable with the ball at your feet at this level, you will eventually
[4574.28 - 4578.60] P:1801.09 E:0.106672 |  ball count out, had three or four passes, and I was kind of going, well wait a minute, you don't
[4578.60 - 4584.04] P:1793.23 E:0.103509 |  look that comfortable, you don't look that comfortable to me, but this time, you know, going,
[4585.00 - 4589.48] P:1767.15 E:0.105494 |  and he's said two players around them, you know, two players around them, and he can't really do
[4589.48 - 4596.12] P:1775.68 E:0.099902 |  that, he cannot do that, that was massively poor to be caught on that, he just wanted to make two
[4596.12 - 4600.60] P:1667.83 E:0.094174 |  changes there, and they just had a little bit of a chance here, to get back into the game by
[4600.60 - 4606.44] P:1790.37 E:0.100486 |  changing the system, and he's kind of killed it for them, it's just that moment of, you know,
[4606.44 - 4611.48] P:1830.16 E:0.103820 |  it's a bit dabbling, if you haven't got the skills launcher, and he hasn't got the skills yet.
[4611.48 - 4616.04] P:1612.99 E:0.107717 |  Well the irony is as well as Australia get us underway, the Emmy Martinez has almost done
[4616.04 - 4621.56] P:1587.10 E:0.102844 |  that twice for Argentina inside his own penalty area, but Matt Ryan there was trying to take on two
[4621.56 - 4626.68] P:1658.29 E:0.095456 |  Argentina players with a bit of fancy footwork inside his own penalty area, it was never going
[4626.68 - 4632.76] P:1546.67 E:0.100727 |  to end well, it's ended very badly for Australia, and Argentina now have the two goal advantage,
[4632.76 - 4638.76] P:1681.70 E:0.097993 |  the double change for Australia, their key playmaker, Aidan Frostich is on, as is Craig Goodwin,
[4638.84 - 4644.36] P:1601.22 E:0.100757 |  Bacchus and Magritte are off, but it's Argentina coming forward, that's a lovely ball by Acunha,
[4644.36 - 4649.40] P:1620.10 E:0.105345 |  through the legs of Frostich, who's recently back from injury, the Palace Verona man on the
[4649.40 - 4654.44] P:1534.22 E:0.100740 |  Europa League with Eintracht Frankfurt last season, really impressed with them, but they missed him
[4655.32 - 4659.80] P:1539.00 E:0.101672 |  at times at this tournament, although again they were so impressive against Tunisia and
[4659.80 - 4666.68] P:1617.37 E:0.096185 |  Demard that they didn't really need him, but he is on, it's an honest substitute in both of those
[4666.68 - 4672.60] P:1559.81 E:0.096991 |  games and now he needs to try and help Australia score two goals, otherwise their World Cup journey,
[4672.60 - 4677.48] P:1508.72 E:0.089696 |  only the second time remember that they've reached this stage of the competition, they're hoping
[4677.48 - 4682.92] P:1644.52 E:0.088021 |  to get to the last date for the first time ever, but Tunisia and Argentina it's a long way back now,
[4682.92 - 4687.48] P:1502.47 E:0.097937 |  as Frostich wins the throw deep in Argentina territory. And in a way they didn't have to do
[4687.48 - 4692.76] P:1524.24 E:0.107087 |  anything, it wasn't even a massively impressive high press, you know, you're timing the ball,
[4693.72 - 4697.80] P:1651.79 E:0.109598 |  you know our options are ahead of them, if you've not got the skill to get the ball down and play it,
[4697.80 - 4702.76] P:1696.77 E:0.110938 |  that's a dangerous situation, and it's, I mean I'd love to see the ball put it back from goalkeepers,
[4702.76 - 4707.88] P:1759.15 E:0.106912 |  but you can tell when you're on the serve, goalkeepers have the ability on the ball,
[4708.60 - 4710.12] P:1512.02 E:0.106783 |  Mattie didn't seem to know it.
[4711.00 - 4716.76] P:1475.31 E:0.104944 |  Balboa Lecky, court of Australia and it will be a free kick to Argentina,
[4716.76 - 4722.04] P:1434.67 E:0.098287 |  Enzo Fernandez going down and again, the Ahmed Bin Ali stadium is bouncing,
[4722.76 - 4728.44] P:1404.49 E:0.097878 |  because Argentina lead by two goals to nil, a reminder you can watch this match on the BBC
[4728.44 - 4735.08] P:1479.67 E:0.083934 |  iPlayer if you want to sync it up with our commentary, just search for World Cup extra on the BBC iPlayer,
[4735.96 - 4741.16] P:1520.84 E:0.092651 |  because Argentina work it out to the right-hand side, leading by two goals to nil,
[4742.12 - 4749.08] P:1537.47 E:0.087995 |  well it has been a World Cup of firsts for Australia, the first time they've scored in every
[4749.08 - 4753.80] P:1479.84 E:0.101578 |  group game, the first time they've won back to back games, had a World Cup, the first time they've
[4753.80 - 4758.52] P:1412.08 E:0.107878 |  won two games in a single edition of a World Cup, but they need something very special now,
[4760.04 - 4766.84] P:1554.41 E:0.103638 |  as the ball is played out to the right-hand side by Matt Ryan in Australia under a bit of pressure
[4766.92 - 4773.72] P:1661.78 E:0.096898 |  by Acuña, Argentina's turn to put the press on and they charge it down with McAllister,
[4773.72 - 4777.24] P:1731.16 E:0.102995 |  it goes behind for an Australia goal kick, let's bring in the former Australia captain,
[4777.24 - 4782.92] P:1520.32 E:0.085651 |  Mila Yedinak and Mila, it's hard to see them coming back from this now Australia.
[4782.92 - 4786.20] P:1451.33 E:0.098164 |  Yeah they need a reaction, obviously disappointing to concede the second goal,
[4786.20 - 4790.76] P:1389.13 E:0.095348 |  just need a reaction, remain concentrate and try and play on the front foot a little more.
[4791.00 - 4797.08] P:1550.60 E:0.092337 |  So Matt Ryan plays the ball out to the right-hand side, he's just got to get that
[4797.08 - 4801.64] P:1605.66 E:0.101438 |  moments out of his head hasn't he Cup? Yeah I suspect he won't be playing out to the back
[4802.20 - 4805.16] P:1622.92 E:0.111448 |  too often if he's got players near him from now on to the end of the game because
[4806.76 - 4810.44] P:1482.72 E:0.110972 |  it's hard enough in this game without giving balls away and giving balls away and it's upsetting,
[4810.44 - 4814.68] P:1604.16 E:0.096207 |  I mean hey everyone makes mistakes, they're trying everything, they've moved the team,
[4814.68 - 4819.40] P:1624.31 E:0.098529 |  really shifted the team around a lot, just now Jackson, he's got a lot of that further back,
[4819.48 - 4826.20] P:1662.29 E:0.104102 |  almost playing the deepest of the midfield, that means you get more players going forward and
[4826.20 - 4829.56] P:1501.30 E:0.096490 |  at least they've got a chance here, got a free kick, trying to put a ball on.
[4829.56 - 4832.92] P:1367.40 E:0.105180 |  Yeah great good win, he's just come on for Australia, he's been brought down on the
[4832.92 - 4836.76] P:1429.35 E:0.103662 |  far side, Australia have the free kick, they're asking whether it should perhaps be a
[4837.32 - 4841.88] P:1508.88 E:0.095047 |  yellow card as well, Christian Romero with the challenge.
[4841.88 - 4845.96] P:1642.33 E:0.097920 |  General there's a trailing leg there, so it's when tackled, I'll try to tackle,
[4845.96 - 4852.76] P:1687.15 E:0.096557 |  miss for miles is right, but the trailing leg and the best of them, and I mean that,
[4852.76 - 4857.40] P:1731.51 E:0.104888 |  i.e. the worst of them know how to do that, they'll leave that trailing leg in there,
[4857.40 - 4861.08] P:1555.17 E:0.101353 |  so they wipe you out, said the embittered winger, former winger.
[4862.68 - 4868.76] P:1528.86 E:0.095336 |  So 17 minutes gone in this second half, Australia trail Argentina by two goals to
[4868.76 - 4873.00] P:1446.82 E:0.093106 |  know but they have a set piece and this is where they've looked most dangerous.
[4873.64 - 4878.92] P:1375.49 E:0.107123 |  Other than Manami Martinez has been taking chances inside his own penalty area, set piece
[4878.92 - 4883.48] P:1472.93 E:0.096039 |  perhaps the best route for them to get on the score sheet as the ball is swung in,
[4884.04 - 4888.12] P:1373.66 E:0.098261 |  put back across, it's good play by Leckie because it wasn't the best delivery.
[4888.92 - 4894.68] P:1344.31 E:0.098689 |  Australia have it with Troustich halfway through the Argentina half, here now is Aramoy,
[4894.68 - 4900.36] P:1376.54 E:0.102642 |  out to the left hand side he goes, ball back across, cleared away from the corner of his own
[4900.44 - 4906.04] P:1533.47 E:0.103709 |  six-yard box behind the Sunday Montines and will be brought down by Rodrigo de Paul.
[4906.04 - 4910.92] P:1551.42 E:0.097254 |  He's got the right reaction he wanted, hasn't he, Milly? He's asking him to lift the pace a
[4910.92 - 4915.72] P:1745.60 E:0.105153 |  lot a bit, chase down, have a goal because this is it now, if you don't get an X-Goal,
[4915.72 - 4921.00] P:1707.95 E:0.110272 |  the World Cup's finished, if you're in Australia. Here come Argentina and here goes Lionel Messi,
[4921.00 - 4926.04] P:1535.84 E:0.104341 |  it's only on the halfway line but they still love the skill, he just, when he gets going like that,
[4926.04 - 4932.28] P:1534.03 E:0.105247 |  he just glides past players with such ease, we've seen it down the years and he's still got it.
[4932.28 - 4936.84] P:1651.46 E:0.100566 |  Yeah, it's very very comfortable, it's much much better when you do it in the final thought
[4936.84 - 4941.96] P:1626.87 E:0.092977 |  because it's much much harder there but it is the pure artistry when it gets in that position.
[4942.84 - 4948.20] P:1362.33 E:0.100730 |  Here is Alex, it's McAllister as Argentina, play it back to Messi, side the centre circle,
[4948.20 - 4955.48] P:1489.49 E:0.097882 |  Messi who scored the opener 10 minutes before the break on his 1,000th appearance for club and country.
[4956.04 - 4960.68] P:1372.81 E:0.104805 |  William Alvarez of Manchester City getting the second after a real howler by the
[4961.72 - 4966.76] P:1624.80 E:0.091670 |  Australia goalkeeper and captain Matt Ryan, but Australia have won the ball back,
[4967.56 - 4972.84] P:1663.91 E:0.097549 |  now they've lost the ball and it will be played forward to the halfway line and here goes Messi
[4972.84 - 4976.68] P:1551.24 E:0.106401 |  once again and Christian Romero's teammate just lifts his hands up as he says go on, you keep going
[4976.68 - 4981.80] P:1666.76 E:0.102818 |  and he's got past three players, Messi, four Australia players, Alvarez back to Messi into the penalty
[4981.80 - 4987.96] P:1735.62 E:0.109139 |  area, this would be brilliant and it's brilliantly stopped by DeGonach, oh what a wonderful run from
[4987.96 - 4996.20] P:1552.86 E:0.106878 |  Messi, that was the magician at his best and the Argentina fans are lauding their hero.
[4996.20 - 5002.20] P:1629.65 E:0.104126 |  Yeah, Bowen and Loha being sent, do you know what, I hope he's not offended but it would have been
[5002.20 - 5006.36] P:1724.23 E:0.092871 |  Maradona-esque, he would have done that, it was really, he got the ball in the halfway line
[5006.92 - 5011.56] P:1729.18 E:0.099028 |  and they were just falling around his feet all over the place, it was bumping off them,
[5011.56 - 5016.92] P:1586.91 E:0.099007 |  using that to push himself forward, that was an absolute moment of genius, actually it was
[5016.92 - 5023.16] P:1421.58 E:0.096427 |  coming here just for that moment wasn't it? Argentina take the corner shorts as Messi
[5024.12 - 5029.72] P:1570.35 E:0.093596 |  pulls it back, the delivery, swung in, header at the far post, he's met by
[5029.72 - 5035.32] P:1464.98 E:0.088699 |  Argentina and also Mendy but cleared away up over the halfway line as the ball bounces
[5035.40 - 5039.16] P:1512.85 E:0.106797 |  by Australia, Argentina will pick it up on the centre of the way back to M.I. Martinez,
[5039.16 - 5043.96] P:1651.16 E:0.105816 |  it's one of those and of course you know Australia will be delighted that DeGonach got the foot in,
[5044.52 - 5049.96] P:1423.14 E:0.102235 |  Pasterhall will be desperate to get back into this game and that belief they'll try and drum up
[5049.96 - 5055.32] P:1442.88 E:0.093939 |  once again but it's one of those as a neutral purely from a footballing perspective, it would have
[5055.32 - 5059.64] P:1700.71 E:0.101378 |  been one of the great World Cup goals. It would have been and if you look back at all the World Cups
[5059.64 - 5064.76] P:1709.59 E:0.100758 |  over the years and look back all the way in 1958 when Pérez scored that goal against Sweden
[5064.76 - 5067.24] P:1611.73 E:0.104481 |  it would have been one of the ones that would have been remembered.
[5067.24 - 5073.56] P:1580.15 E:0.105588 |  Kynia's ball in, oh what a chance, racing through the centre, Argentina can't make contact,
[5073.56 - 5077.72] P:1373.73 E:0.100856 |  McAllister will pick it up on the right hand side, what a delivery that was, remarkable,
[5077.72 - 5083.00] P:1527.02 E:0.098620 |  so Kynia and Australia suddenly becoming stretched, here is Messi, drives on the edge of the D
[5083.72 - 5088.44] P:1608.05 E:0.112171 |  and the ball is over the bar but Argentina really starting to hit their stride here.
[5089.00 - 5093.80] P:1658.98 E:0.114611 |  You can see Messi coming alive now because he knows that space that he has been waiting for,
[5094.44 - 5099.32] P:1787.34 E:0.109296 |  walking about, looking around, swivelling his head saying when's it going to happen,
[5099.32 - 5105.00] P:1738.14 E:0.103460 |  it's happened and he can have a ball now because there are giant gaps, now it's not just because
[5105.00 - 5108.52] P:1794.78 E:0.104676 |  the Australian players are going to love that tag and I'm playing close to that, it's because they
[5108.52 - 5113.96] P:1637.94 E:0.099160 |  have to take chances and that's playing right into Argentina's hands and of course no one more
[5114.52 - 5119.40] P:1827.11 E:0.094797 |  than Lionel Messi who's just picking up this business. Here are Australia on the half-way
[5119.40 - 5124.92] P:1622.21 E:0.094334 |  line, 2-0 Argentina lead approaching the midway point of the second half here on Five Live
[5124.92 - 5131.32] P:1374.10 E:0.093851 |  and big as the sounds as Australia get the decision on this wide right position, it will be a free kick,
[5131.32 - 5136.44] P:1460.36 E:0.094051 |  Ray Marneau there, hands clasped behind his back just trying out of his technical area,
[5137.32 - 5144.44] P:1768.21 E:0.105995 |  well they have enjoyed a wonderful wonderful World Cup Australia, can they find two goals
[5145.08 - 5150.44] P:1586.57 E:0.101543 |  to level against an Argentina side who are starting to kick here at the Atmed Ben Ali Stadium.
[5150.44 - 5154.76] P:1641.25 E:0.101692 |  Just the one you start with, just need one to start with, that'll change everything,
[5154.76 - 5159.24] P:1716.46 E:0.099478 |  the atmosphere within their players and with their obvious small number of fans will change
[5159.24 - 5163.88] P:1344.85 E:0.098098 |  everything that they do, there's one goal. Set piece again, free kick, wide right, Goodwin
[5163.88 - 5170.76] P:1748.81 E:0.095307 |  sent it in and it's straight into the arms of Emi Martinez. It's a couple of the last couple of
[5170.76 - 5175.24] P:1699.46 E:0.093404 |  a put in there and you haven't been good enough balls at all, I mean really that's far too easy,
[5175.24 - 5179.64] P:1706.08 E:0.084809 |  that's far too much hate on it, go keep on it's second chance, of course it's going to walk up
[5179.64 - 5186.92] P:1725.56 E:0.086075 |  and take that, no not very good. Just in a short of Angel Di Maria who's not involved today,
[5187.72 - 5193.16] P:1521.52 E:0.086815 |  was listed on the team sheet but wasn't warming up, wasn't taking any part in that at all so
[5193.72 - 5200.52] P:1437.63 E:0.087160 |  won't be involved today. Just singing along with the Argentina fans sitting down there on the bench,
[5200.52 - 5206.20] P:1654.73 E:0.106089 |  banging a water bottle on the side of the dugout and tying to the music, it's all going very nicely
[5206.20 - 5211.72] P:1588.96 E:0.089826 |  for Argentina and we have to say if you're just joining us on five lives Argentina winner throw
[5211.72 - 5218.68] P:1550.79 E:0.090824 |  inside their own half, the first 35 minutes Australia for much of that period with a better
[5218.68 - 5224.76] P:1461.93 E:0.096002 |  side and the goal came against the run of play when it did but we always knew and you always know
[5225.40 - 5229.56] P:1460.05 E:0.085021 |  that when Messi's on the pitch that can happen. Yeah and they talked about it beforehand and
[5229.56 - 5234.52] P:1783.84 E:0.092977 |  you knew that was a possibility, they had to stay concentrated and it was only a tiny, tiny little
[5234.52 - 5239.16] P:1832.17 E:0.089280 |  turning off of concentration, it was in the left back area like I suggested before the game,
[5239.72 - 5244.68] P:1728.69 E:0.089812 |  this corner happened and it was a real shame that because Messi knew that and that's why he
[5244.76 - 5248.92] P:1720.14 E:0.102841 |  lingered there and lingered there and lingered there and they got the chance eventually and
[5248.92 - 5253.08] P:1741.66 E:0.103538 |  it's made a big difference to the game but it's not over yet, I mean keep on going but the quality
[5253.08 - 5258.12] P:1743.97 E:0.097303 |  of ball when you get a corner, when you get a chance to cross has to be much much better for the Aussies.
[5259.16 - 5264.28] P:1323.66 E:0.102357 |  Argentina are in possession, midway through their own half, De Sando Martinez sends the ball forward
[5264.28 - 5269.48] P:1551.50 E:0.107222 |  at Cunha who's really pushing back, pushing forward more in this wing back roll gets forward
[5269.64 - 5274.76] P:1851.14 E:0.093920 |  but he's a judge who have committed the foul and it will be a free kick to Australia
[5276.36 - 5279.56] P:1759.62 E:0.106035 |  just outside the main pen of the area. Yeah just looking at the way they're showing the plane again
[5280.28 - 5286.20] P:1845.07 E:0.093054 |  when they played before they actually changed it to a back five win back in the previous game
[5286.20 - 5292.60] P:1858.44 E:0.090282 |  at one point, I think looked a lot better, I thought the wing backs were becoming their strongest players
[5292.60 - 5298.28] P:1882.37 E:0.091476 |  and I guess what we're talking about is the left foot back, when he gets the ball in an attacking
[5298.28 - 5302.20] P:1778.62 E:0.092249 |  position he looks so much better, he's not got forward at all in the second half has he?
[5304.04 - 5309.80] P:1576.37 E:0.085974 |  He heads the ball on, Mitchell Duke is chasing down but can't get there and Argentina will bring
[5309.80 - 5315.80] P:1514.80 E:0.092857 |  the ball away with a Cunha who just turns, under pressure from Prostich, Lecky gets the foot in
[5315.80 - 5322.60] P:1599.25 E:0.093004 |  and then roars his frustration to the darkening sky in Doha because the ball is out of play.
[5323.40 - 5327.16] P:1414.57 E:0.093962 |  Graham Arnold is preparing to make another change.
[5327.48 - 5330.44] P:1559.79 E:0.111729 |  A bunch of changes coming in, we've got a couple from Argentina as well
[5331.56 - 5334.20] P:1531.71 E:0.108773 |  what do they want to do that in this morning? They want to
[5334.84 - 5338.60] P:1606.32 E:0.102766 |  and they want to kill as much time as possible, they want to see this game out, there's only 20
[5338.60 - 5344.12] P:1825.32 E:0.093581 |  minutes to go and if they manage this game well they'll have, remember it's the first one, so they
[5344.12 - 5351.48] P:1716.91 E:0.087887 |  have a bit of a rest, like an extra 20 minutes rest. Well Prostich is standing right next to
[5352.28 - 5355.96] P:1416.18 E:0.103214 |  Marcos of Cunha here, he's not too happy with her, Cunha is taking the throw but
[5356.60 - 5362.84] P:1565.54 E:0.095522 |  referee just tells him to move away, he does so and we play on, all goes out of play for another
[5362.84 - 5369.48] P:1537.17 E:0.092478 |  Argentina throw, they are as Pat says going to make a double change, Argentina,
[5371.88 - 5378.92] P:1629.60 E:0.107051 |  will they make it now, referee is giving them the option, yes he's pointing, Argentina say well
[5378.92 - 5384.44] P:1864.10 E:0.103996 |  is this what we're doing, are we going to make it now and the referee has said yes you are
[5384.44 - 5389.56] P:1785.90 E:0.104148 |  and big applause for Julian Alvarez, the Manchester City man, he scored the second goal
[5390.76 - 5397.00] P:1777.22 E:0.098008 |  that puts Argentina 2-0 up and firmly with one foot given the control they have of this game as well
[5397.56 - 5398.60] P:1752.04 E:0.095630 |  in the quarterfinals.
[5400.60 - 5407.08] P:1704.74 E:0.098433 |  Well very soon they're coming off, I actually thought, oh Cunha, he actually looked a little bit leggy
[5407.08 - 5412.36] P:1762.86 E:0.104973 |  from about 20 minutes into the first half so I'm not completely surprised that he's gone off.
[5417.48 - 5422.52] P:1701.47 E:0.101994 |  I can tell the fagal coming on, maybe there's no surprise at all there, you know that's a very
[5422.52 - 5430.36] P:1698.15 E:0.093608 |  much a light for light in that situation. And here come the australian changes, so yes Cunha
[5430.36 - 5437.16] P:1673.45 E:0.085528 |  and Alvarez are for Argentina, we've already had one Martinez on, we have Lotharo Martinez
[5437.72 - 5440.76] P:1461.17 E:0.081701 |  into Milan on and as Pat says Tagliafico
[5443.00 - 5446.44] P:1497.34 E:0.099529 |  and australian changing things up as well, the triple change,
[5447.72 - 5455.48] P:1671.85 E:0.092143 |  Branquil, Jamie McLaren, Frank Karacic on for Dignic Duke who really has worked hard
[5456.04 - 5460.60] P:1561.70 E:0.093330 |  up front but has had very little service and lekkie making way.
[5461.48 - 5465.80] P:1740.41 E:0.112588 |  And I just hope, I think the australians will be hoping that those first half will make some sort
[5465.80 - 5471.24] P:1774.66 E:0.096907 |  of a difference, it's not looked a great deal like it so far, you know they've huffed and puffed,
[5471.80 - 5474.76] P:1566.27 E:0.104342 |  I don't think they did much more than that, they've huffed and puffed in the second half and
[5475.88 - 5479.72] P:1706.51 E:0.101346 |  you know if you look back in a game and say we never took a chance as when they came,
[5480.28 - 5485.64] P:1717.78 E:0.108073 |  we haven't been in it. And here come Argentina wants more, looking to ruck this up once and for
[5485.64 - 5495.24] P:1705.15 E:0.087617 |  all, australia deal with the ball through the middle and play it out to just outside the
[5495.24 - 5503.32] P:1253.53 E:0.087421 |  main penalty area, two nil, Argentina lead, 17 minutes plus added time to play. Well their
[5503.32 - 5509.64] P:1259.61 E:0.093432 |  youngsters did it at the Olympics last summer under Graham Arnold, they beat Argentina's under 23
[5509.96 - 5518.20] P:1585.30 E:0.083356 |  in what was a huge shock even at that level but they trailed two nil australia and they
[5518.20 - 5525.16] P:1512.02 E:0.092433 |  need something very special, it would go down in australian sporting folklore were they to reach
[5525.16 - 5530.28] P:1455.47 E:0.094525 |  the quarter finals for the first time in their history from this position all into the area
[5530.28 - 5536.76] P:1757.88 E:0.101999 |  from Jackson Irvine, is claimed by Emmy Martinez, who claims that so easily under no pressure and
[5536.76 - 5542.44] P:1607.01 E:0.096873 |  then goes down in stages does need to his knees to the floor holds the ball gets back up to his
[5542.44 - 5547.72] P:1199.16 E:0.096224 |  knees, stand he back up now, the second sticking away, Argentina leading 2-0. You're not surprised
[5547.72 - 5552.92] P:1549.53 E:0.104241 |  that they're managing the game well, heart and mouth for a wee moment, felt Ryan was coming back out
[5552.92 - 5559.88] P:1679.07 E:0.099463 |  to get the ball, he thought better of it, he might as well pick the ball all the way, it's a bit
[5559.88 - 5564.60] P:1624.48 E:0.109340 |  two yards from the corner flag, the referee is saying no no, you've kicked for touch there and
[5564.60 - 5569.08] P:1719.25 E:0.101504 |  that's a bit as good a kick for touch, you'll ever see in any coat of football, rugby or association.
[5570.20 - 5574.04] P:1438.56 E:0.097040 |  So is that a play for an australian throw, they do clear it up towards the halfway line,
[5574.60 - 5581.32] P:1464.95 E:0.095680 |  sent forward by Otten Mendy, picked up by Goodwin, australia, clears long downfield
[5582.04 - 5585.72] P:1496.98 E:0.105414 |  and it will get the deflection of the blue and white shares as well, an australia
[5586.36 - 5590.92] P:1520.14 E:0.093470 |  have the throw but as is so often the case, packed with five substitutions made at that point,
[5590.92 - 5595.72] P:1349.77 E:0.095152 |  three for australia, two for argentina, the rhythm just going out of the game and argentina
[5595.72 - 5600.28] P:1241.88 E:0.088772 |  won't mind that a job, they're 2-0 up, they're heading through to the quarterfinals in a match-up
[5600.28 - 5606.28] P:1287.41 E:0.084953 |  with the Netherlands who beat the USA by three goals to one, unless in the final 15 minutes,
[5606.92 - 5612.60] P:1654.27 E:0.098569 |  australia can provide some more late drama and we're never going to write that off at this
[5612.60 - 5618.68] P:1781.97 E:0.096791 |  world cup as advantage is played, ball into the area, pulled across goal by the substitute,
[5618.68 - 5624.84] P:1765.04 E:0.092770 |  Nicholas Tagliafico and behind for an australian goal kick. My heart was slightly in my mouth there,
[5624.84 - 5629.00] P:1892.54 E:0.092235 |  I think was that Jackson Irvine, he made another tackle in the middle of the pitch, said he's
[5629.00 - 5636.12] P:1923.33 E:0.094436 |  already on a yellow card and I think the referee's been quite nice to him there, he is on his absolute
[5636.12 - 5641.64] P:1775.74 E:0.090350 |  last warning there isn't he, just slightly late, takes him on the foot but then his knee falls
[5641.64 - 5647.64] P:1748.31 E:0.091172 |  through, goes flying over the top and Jackson Irvine, very very lucky, he's got a tip two through
[5647.64 - 5653.72] P:1532.27 E:0.098023 |  the rest of this game though. And that's a worse challenge than the initial yellow card was as well,
[5654.36 - 5659.80] P:1409.72 E:0.094525 |  it is something that whether it should or shouldn't be easing the referee's mind on occasion that
[5659.80 - 5663.88] P:1373.43 E:0.095388 |  a player's already been put but if you get to yellow for the first one then certainly should get a
[5663.88 - 5668.76] P:1492.71 E:0.088030 |  yellow, second yellow for the second one, as the ball goes out of play for an australia throw
[5668.76 - 5674.36] P:1302.03 E:0.087429 |  into the final 14 minutes, two balls on the pitch, the referee spotted it and again it just
[5674.44 - 5681.88] P:1434.41 E:0.086011 |  ekes the seconds out for Argentina but since that Lionel Messi goal and yes australia were
[5681.88 - 5687.40] P:1389.99 E:0.087675 |  masters of their own downfall, the error from Matt Ryan allowing Alvarez to get what looks like it
[5687.40 - 5694.76] P:1447.60 E:0.077019 |  could be the key second but Argentina have looked comfortable, they've looked in control and they've
[5694.76 - 5699.88] P:1347.95 E:0.092089 |  looked more like the side, they're a third in the world with Australia 38th but Australia are coming
[5699.88 - 5705.32] P:1724.74 E:0.105162 |  forward, Argentina get the deflection in, oh deflection takes it into the goal, great good win
[5705.32 - 5712.76] P:1683.41 E:0.101835 |  on the follow-up from 20 yards, a cruel deflection for Argentina, the ball's in the back of the net
[5713.32 - 5722.44] P:1656.14 E:0.106994 |  and hold your horses, is this welcome, go to Gibbers yet another remarkable twist, Australia back in it,
[5722.44 - 5728.28] P:1603.86 E:0.104579 |  two-one Argentina lead. Do you know anything can happen because as a previous game said,
[5728.52 - 5734.36] P:1780.24 E:0.107432 |  you've got no chance, this game's all over, suddenly one little thing changes, a little bit of
[5734.36 - 5740.28] P:1683.86 E:0.100416 |  belief, players know this is the one chance possibly in their lifetime and then suddenly go wow,
[5740.28 - 5745.24] P:1715.28 E:0.095743 |  just a few more, keep them same, get yourself up the field there, if he could play wing but
[5745.24 - 5749.96] P:1787.67 E:0.102269 |  he was the reason, he goes flying up there, beats the player, puts a danger in his crosshand,
[5749.96 - 5754.76] P:1747.54 E:0.103113 |  when it comes out, yeah they get a bit of luck, you just want to see that happen a lot more often
[5754.76 - 5760.20] P:1807.98 E:0.095938 |  from the Australians, oh I think uh I think Melia begin to back state to those playing same,
[5761.64 - 5769.00] P:1431.78 E:0.096841 |  well well well, hold on to your hats, 13 minutes plus added time to play,
[5770.76 - 5777.64] P:1439.54 E:0.096977 |  are Australia going to provide the latest shock, the latest story at a World Cup that's been
[5777.64 - 5784.04] P:1432.65 E:0.095029 |  absolutely jam packed with them, Argentina now having been stunned by Saudi Arabia, remember
[5784.04 - 5792.60] P:1577.15 E:0.090146 |  already in this competition, suddenly have to find a little bit of urgency once again or a little
[5792.60 - 5797.16] P:1574.33 E:0.090558 |  bit of composure which they've shown, they've shown throughout this match, since Lionel Messi put
[5797.16 - 5803.16] P:1393.43 E:0.095908 |  them ahead, they have to find that again, they have to draw on it, they have to close down as they
[5803.16 - 5809.72] P:1271.24 E:0.095071 |  did there, Aramoy dispossessed just the one goal in it now as Argentina come forward once again
[5809.72 - 5815.48] P:1314.24 E:0.096565 |  with Rodrigo de Paul, plays it to Messi, he was looking for Taglia Fico, it's intercepted by
[5815.48 - 5820.20] P:1559.67 E:0.090551 |  Australia, who come down the right hand side, they're still inside their own half Australia,
[5820.20 - 5825.24] P:1610.66 E:0.096202 |  good recovery by Taglia Fico, who gets round, trust itch and plays it in field to McAllister,
[5825.24 - 5830.52] P:1506.62 E:0.099176 |  and here is Lionel Messi, laced it off to Rodrigo de Paul, 30 yards out, thought about how me ago,
[5831.08 - 5836.60] P:1442.20 E:0.091568 |  Messi might, into the D now, central position, Taglia Fico is found on the left hand side of
[5836.60 - 5841.32] P:1314.53 E:0.094232 |  the penalty area, and Argentina will just slow the play down, looking to peek their way through,
[5841.32 - 5846.20] P:1492.46 E:0.100015 |  Messi up against Souza, plays it to Taglia Fico, good sliding challenge on the edge of the D,
[5847.00 - 5852.36] P:1667.72 E:0.088161 |  and it's cleared away, the flag is up, there's the challenge, came in on the edge of the six-yard
[5852.36 - 5856.44] P:1531.74 E:0.093471 |  box, that was a nervy one for Australia because it was one of those, it was bouncing everywhere,
[5856.44 - 5861.56] P:1224.58 E:0.096188 |  could easily have hit a hand in there, but the flag is up on the far side, and Australia have
[5861.56 - 5866.44] P:1414.53 E:0.101426 |  the free kick inside their own penalty area, it's the Australia fans that are trying to
[5866.44 - 5872.76] P:1414.35 E:0.105928 |  raise the noise in that little patch of sunshine, amidst the blue and white, down to our right,
[5872.76 - 5881.24] P:1418.46 E:0.095720 |  but Argentina, all around the rest of this stadium, are responding in kind, trying to see their side
[5881.32 - 5895.00] P:1431.30 E:0.090058 |  over the line, two-one, as further changes are made for Argentina, Gonzalo Montiel is coming on,
[5895.96 - 5899.56] P:1441.59 E:0.105052 |  changing the whole right hand side, because I think bringing Palacio out on from the counter
[5899.56 - 5908.36] P:1345.01 E:0.089599 |  instead as well, yeah, Molina off, McAllister off, Palacio's on, Montiel on, Argentina, look to respond
[5909.08 - 5914.12] P:1471.27 E:0.091912 |  to that Australia goal that has faced this very interesting once again,
[5914.92 - 5921.72] P:1428.32 E:0.088112 |  at this World Cup on five live at BBC Sound, 11 minutes to play, plus added time, just the goal
[5921.72 - 5928.84] P:1637.62 E:0.083316 |  in it now, as the ball is sent forward by Karacic, Guel can't bring it down, it's cleared away by
[5928.84 - 5934.68] P:1292.03 E:0.086393 |  Christian Romero, he'll be picked up by Behege on that left hand side, nice little one-two,
[5934.68 - 5939.24] P:1657.97 E:0.106346 |  driving down Behege once again into the penalty area, oh this is brilliant, can he go all the way
[5939.24 - 5945.80] P:1639.81 E:0.103456 |  Behege, brilliant sliding interception, sent it behind from Nistandro Martinez, well I'll tell you
[5945.80 - 5950.28] P:1626.75 E:0.100833 |  what, if that's messy at the other end, and it almost was earlier in this second half, that,
[5950.28 - 5956.28] P:1604.59 E:0.101412 |  Pat Novid, you said it earlier, Maradona Esqu, once again, yeah no, but please can you get this guy,
[5956.28 - 5962.04] P:1651.65 E:0.102371 |  BH, to play in the left wing, what have you got on the left back, we're complaining, it's our waste
[5962.04 - 5966.92] P:1682.19 E:0.103827 |  having him there, he's the best goal that got going forward, stuck him at left back, he's almost
[5966.92 - 5971.88] P:1393.23 E:0.101388 |  scored one of the best goals I've ever seen on the World Cup there. Corner for Australia, it's
[5971.88 - 5976.52] P:1559.76 E:0.107072 |  cleared away by Argentina, Frostich will curl, that's not too far away from Angelo Post and Bar,
[5976.52 - 5982.12] P:1531.71 E:0.098441 |  it's behind for an Argentina goal kick, that was unbelievable from Behege.
[5984.04 - 5988.12] P:1617.89 E:0.108609 |  I mean it's unbelievable because everything he gets about going forward, go on a bit of
[5988.12 - 5994.52] P:1537.16 E:0.096549 |  a time, he's not great as a defender, he's a truly brilliant going forward, completely wasted
[5994.52 - 6000.36] P:1596.78 E:0.085982 |  back there, good defender in the last moment, but it just keeps on going, by the way Camilla's
[6000.36 - 6006.36] P:1660.30 E:0.092424 |  talking anymore. Well let's bring him in for Australia captain Mila, yet another, goodness me
[6006.36 - 6013.24] P:1510.45 E:0.092880 |  Behege, what a run, what an almost goal. Yeah talk just about, thanks for having me in, game on,
[6013.24 - 6015.72] P:1535.34 E:0.089443 |  it's game on, you know, what a great opportunity.
[6018.36 - 6025.56] P:1571.26 E:0.091465 |  Can Australia take it? They trail by two goals to one, to Argentina, we're into the final eight
[6025.56 - 6031.72] P:1439.78 E:0.093637 |  minutes plus added time, but there is renewed life, renewed belief in that Australian midfield,
[6031.72 - 6035.96] P:1728.95 E:0.098449 |  they want the free kick on our way, they'll get it as well, Frostich fouled. They're fearless now,
[6035.96 - 6040.12] P:1832.48 E:0.101758 |  just that heart they've got already, okay we don't care what you're wearing, don't care about those
[6040.12 - 6043.88] P:1731.52 E:0.092424 |  blown white strips, they're just going to go and tackle it, we're going to chase everything,
[6043.88 - 6047.48] P:1654.51 E:0.093764 |  we're going to give every bit of heart, this is what we're talking about before the game
[6047.48 - 6051.40] P:1708.03 E:0.097549 |  for the Australians, the one thing you're not going to worry about is give everything,
[6051.40 - 6055.80] P:1601.08 E:0.102415 |  everything they've got them, for these last eight minutes, unless they lose a goal,
[6055.80 - 6060.52] P:1587.73 E:0.097516 |  they are going to try and pound that defence. All forward into the penalty area,
[6060.52 - 6066.20] P:1581.34 E:0.096809 |  Emi Martinez will claim it and again he tives to the compound, and perhaps got his head in his hands
[6066.28 - 6070.12] P:1547.99 E:0.096681 |  next to me, I mean you've got to expect it haven't you? Yeah you've got to expect it, but
[6070.84 - 6074.52] P:1578.22 E:0.097617 |  goalkeepers are well closer to yours now, I'd give a fell against that one,
[6075.08 - 6081.56] P:1699.59 E:0.093223 |  honestly, get the ball standing up then fall down, really? I know everyone does it, but when
[6081.56 - 6087.96] P:1424.44 E:0.091835 |  did it become a thing? It's not the best clearance in the end from Emi Martinez, he took all the time,
[6087.96 - 6091.32] P:1548.18 E:0.096929 |  he could over it but it's gone straight out of play for a throw which Karatich will take,
[6091.48 - 6097.24] P:1754.11 E:0.093526 |  Karatich has got some distance on that and Matt Ryan just scampering across a six-yard box to
[6097.24 - 6104.12] P:1783.99 E:0.094263 |  pick it up for Australia, who trailed to one seven minutes plus out of time to play, Garan Kual
[6105.40 - 6111.00] P:1619.76 E:0.096771 |  wins the header and concedes the foul as well, well he went flying in there, Kual,
[6112.36 - 6117.24] P:1527.99 E:0.090953 |  you can tell they're up for it Australia, but the more free kicks they give away, of course he's
[6117.24 - 6123.80] P:1550.11 E:0.089187 |  got a challenge for that ball, but coming into the back of Cristian Romero there. Well Romero's
[6123.80 - 6128.84] P:1512.08 E:0.105728 |  holding his face as if he's been barred on the face, it's actually a cheat down there, down
[6128.84 - 6134.04] P:1705.76 E:0.097020 |  below on his chin, I think he'd live my money then he's going to be fine, it was a rough strong tackle
[6134.04 - 6139.32] P:1741.41 E:0.095751 |  but he's going to kill every second he possibly can, and you've almost, you've got to applaud
[6139.32 - 6143.56] P:1705.76 E:0.093636 |  the Australians because they weren't thinking that way well, the Argentinians, you know, a few
[6143.56 - 6149.08] P:1741.14 E:0.085696 |  minutes ago, they were so comfortable with where they were, no, they're going to try and play and
[6149.08 - 6158.28] P:1898.98 E:0.086522 |  the little trekkers worked out because they're worried. So Romero belatedly is up to his feet,
[6158.84 - 6165.80] P:1659.85 E:0.081097 |  Argentina two, Australia one, that good win effort which took a huge deflection off Enzo
[6165.80 - 6171.16] P:1685.74 E:0.086942 |  Fernandez and it has officially in the stadium been credited as an Enzo Fernandez own goal,
[6171.24 - 6176.28] P:1736.19 E:0.084674 |  Australia won't care a job, good win got the effort in, it was a huge deflection,
[6176.28 - 6181.96] P:1449.91 E:0.090945 |  Enzo Fernandez with no chance, but you need a bit of luck sometimes, Australia got that,
[6181.96 - 6188.44] P:1690.23 E:0.086316 |  they'll argue they made it, but Argentina looking to wrap this one up as the flag goes up against
[6188.44 - 6193.40] P:1618.63 E:0.083068 |  Messi, Ryan got there anyway and Australia will have a free kick outside their own penalty area,
[6193.40 - 6199.72] P:1581.42 E:0.088938 |  six minutes plus other time to play on five live and BBC sounds, Argentina two, Australia one.
[6199.80 - 6204.12] P:1846.87 E:0.086820 |  They've not created a huge bunch of chances to Australia's, the thing is they haven't played
[6204.12 - 6208.44] P:1691.20 E:0.108124 |  with this intensity for a lot of well on the game so it may well be that they will get one or two more.
[6209.80 - 6217.64] P:1701.28 E:0.098814 |  Prostit runs right into Enzo Fernandez, he's off over the halfway line for Argentina and it will
[6217.64 - 6224.20] P:1399.04 E:0.090153 |  just start to open up here as Lautaro Martinez picks it up on the left hand side of the penalty
[6224.20 - 6229.48] P:1647.85 E:0.100500 |  area runs straight into Harry's suit and had a rather plaintive look at our referee,
[6230.04 - 6236.20] P:1353.73 E:0.091383 |  Simeon Marciniak, he said absolutely nothing doing there, Granqual will pick it up for Australia,
[6236.76 - 6244.68] P:1845.45 E:0.093455 |  the man who is joining Newcastle in January on the youngster to try and help Australia
[6244.68 - 6249.00] P:1759.04 E:0.095104 |  haul themselves level, they have five minutes plus other time to do it.
[6249.00 - 6253.40] P:1808.42 E:0.098850 |  Now they have to push right up, there's a through in here, it's only been three or four yards
[6253.40 - 6259.00] P:1799.00 E:0.101645 |  from the buy line in Argentina, this is a great opportunity, get out there, close down, get as
[6259.00 - 6264.20] P:1789.04 E:0.105982 |  many yellow gels as you can get in that area and try and win the ball back, high up the field,
[6264.20 - 6267.32] P:1741.76 E:0.103287 |  this is what you hate to have a through in late on in the game.
[6269.72 - 6275.80] P:1548.24 E:0.097998 |  So throat for Argentina deep inside their own territory, they lead by two goals to one,
[6276.76 - 6282.92] P:1581.86 E:0.088674 |  Lautaro Martinez will pick the ball up and you can see the free kick and
[6283.72 - 6288.84] P:1392.81 E:0.089469 |  he's turning away Harry's suit, but I think I can sense the grimace from here because it just
[6288.84 - 6295.48] P:1435.25 E:0.083165 |  ticks the seconds down, but again credit to Australia, it was fortunate in terms of the
[6295.48 - 6301.32] P:1543.46 E:0.094584 |  goal they got back with a huge deflection. They've just done that twice in a row, they stole
[6301.32 - 6306.20] P:1640.50 E:0.090679 |  15 yards from the throw and they just stole 10 yards from the free kick as well that everybody
[6306.20 - 6311.88] P:1397.29 E:0.096218 |  hasn't seen. Here they come down the right hand side Argentina, another goal would surely spell
[6311.88 - 6318.28] P:1213.02 E:0.085998 |  curtains for Australia, just the one in it at the moment as we enter the final three minutes
[6318.28 - 6323.48] P:1196.62 E:0.091836 |  plus added time, Argentina still keeping hold of the ball over on that right hand side, that's
[6323.48 - 6329.56] P:1249.26 E:0.089984 |  all they need to do. Rodrigo de Poul, nice one too, plays it in field, Aaron Boy gets a foot in,
[6329.56 - 6334.20] P:1573.01 E:0.093726 |  it's given away there by Jackson Irvine and here come Argentina once again, messy.
[6334.76 - 6339.48] P:1149.68 E:0.117368 |  We've got things underway in the first half out to the left hand side and Taglia Fico
[6340.04 - 6346.44] P:1134.69 E:0.099472 |  is well pressured by Karacic, but squeezes it out to Enzo Fernandez and now Rodrigo de Poul down,
[6346.44 - 6353.32] P:1307.37 E:0.093933 |  the right hand side, Benic stands up well, Romero stepped up from centre half for Argentina who just
[6354.28 - 6359.64] P:1255.82 E:0.099271 |  bring the ball back to half way. Enzo Fernandez a little change of pace, loose into the gaps,
[6359.64 - 6365.88] P:1054.93 E:0.105667 |  played forward now by Felacios, now messy as Argentina suddenly send the blue and white
[6365.88 - 6372.12] P:1738.58 E:0.105837 |  shirts forward and Martinez pulls the ball right across the face of goal, Lautaro Martinez
[6372.68 - 6376.68] P:1697.42 E:0.101670 |  into the area but can't do the damage. Yeah but that was one of the best pieces of play from
[6376.68 - 6381.64] P:1726.09 E:0.098270 |  Argentina in this game so far, under a lot of pressure they do the right thing, they manage
[6381.72 - 6386.76] P:1616.31 E:0.096632 |  the game, they hold the ball, they pass it, they don't try anything silly and then when they see the
[6386.76 - 6391.00] P:1675.98 E:0.108309 |  little gap in the Australian's you get a lot of that tired there, they almost get through and almost
[6391.00 - 6397.48] P:1853.13 E:0.109511 |  score, that was a really really good piece of play by the Argentines. Replaying Messi's goal
[6397.48 - 6404.28] P:1581.53 E:0.098129 |  again and again on the fixed screens around the stadium but Australia know that if they can find
[6404.28 - 6411.40] P:1578.42 E:0.095481 |  a goal in the final two minutes plus added time we'll be heading for extra time, two won they trail
[6412.52 - 6417.80] P:1641.09 E:0.100279 |  will they get a final chance or will Argentina wrap it up, he's off again,
[6417.80 - 6425.08] P:1657.00 E:0.101068 |  Lionel Messi towards the penalty area still going, Messi lays it off and Lautaro Martinez
[6425.08 - 6430.76] P:1576.03 E:0.099189 |  has missed a sit-up, tried to curl it into the top corner as Messi did into the bottom corner in
[6430.76 - 6435.24] P:1573.36 E:0.098927 |  the first half and is behind and Australia have got us moving already. Do you know what,
[6435.24 - 6439.96] P:1655.20 E:0.093337 |  if that hasn't bough well that's a stinker of a mess there, that's everything you want, it's laid
[6440.60 - 6446.04] P:1681.59 E:0.090334 |  on a plate by Messi, all he has to do is whip it in towards the back corner, he is skidin.
[6448.36 - 6454.04] P:1682.44 E:0.096907 |  Will it cost Argentina, Australia still struggling to make headway towards that
[6454.04 - 6457.72] P:1618.91 E:0.095151 |  Argentina penalty area but the goal that they've got back really came from nothing,
[6458.44 - 6465.16] P:1626.37 E:0.095433 |  so they will believe that little patch of sunshine behind the Argentina goal will believe.
[6465.88 - 6469.00] P:1657.48 E:0.097883 |  They've got a long throw here, he's going to take it in, is it the big man up?
[6469.00 - 6475.56] P:1633.78 E:0.094756 |  Yep, Karicic throwing it in, Cetara is up there, heads it on, won't quite fall for Jamie McLaren
[6476.12 - 6480.44] P:1678.48 E:0.101982 |  and Emi Martinez claims very well under pressure from Cetara and in the end there was too much
[6480.44 - 6485.32] P:1788.02 E:0.095849 |  pressure from Cetara who is now surrounded by Argentina players and the referee's got
[6485.32 - 6490.76] P:1877.64 E:0.097749 |  in the middle of that very quickly, frustration for Harry Cetara, quick hit for Argentina and
[6490.76 - 6498.12] P:2066.52 E:0.105489 |  Emi Martinez is still stied down. Really? That surprises you, you know it's a shame they
[6498.12 - 6502.84] P:1852.75 E:0.095251 |  wouldn't break him down, Martinez has gone up there, he's gone down like the proverb with
[6502.84 - 6507.96] P:1784.32 E:0.092758 |  Snack of Spuds, he's all moved for about a minute there, there is a square root of nothing wrong
[6507.96 - 6512.20] P:1708.92 E:0.104482 |  with him and we all know that very well, but you can't blame him, you know, it's what everyone does,
[6513.40 - 6519.40] P:1727.57 E:0.101081 |  they have managed it well haven't they, generally very very few chances against them this second
[6519.40 - 6525.72] P:1831.35 E:0.101937 |  happened, the goal that Argentina's harm actually was, it was a complete deflection so they can turn
[6525.72 - 6530.60] P:1689.15 E:0.093544 |  around and say you know we've got to put under that much pressure, but the Arabian worry don't
[6530.60 - 6535.40] P:1723.95 E:0.104982 |  they, they want to know how many minutes we're going to find out in seconds. And the board has come
[6535.40 - 6542.84] P:1540.15 E:0.092512 |  up seven minutes of added time, seven minutes for Australia to find an equaliser, otherwise
[6542.84 - 6548.52] P:1599.16 E:0.087142 |  they're bid to reach the quarterfinals of the World Cup for the first time in their history, will
[6548.52 - 6556.92] P:1578.33 E:0.085690 |  be over, Taglia Fico for Argentina down to Laudaro Martinez, tried a bit of skill to work his way
[6556.92 - 6563.16] P:1621.54 E:0.092008 |  towards the penalty area, it's cleared away by Australia and the throw goes their way as well,
[6563.16 - 6570.12] P:1647.10 E:0.093542 |  all the way back to Kairos, inside the Australia penalty area, we have seen late drama at this
[6570.12 - 6577.08] P:1641.27 E:0.092828 |  World Cup already, plenty of it, he's there to be more at the Ahmed Bin Ali Stadium, the ground upon
[6577.08 - 6583.32] P:1643.40 E:0.099292 |  which Australia beats the favourites Peru in the playoff to reach this World Cup, is their journey
[6583.32 - 6589.80] P:1642.60 E:0.100786 |  ending here this evening, or is there to be one more twist, one more turn in this tale,
[6589.80 - 6594.28] P:1477.53 E:0.103925 |  Argentina have the throw on the far side, their fans are enjoying this.
[6596.76 - 6602.20] P:1876.51 E:0.107727 |  Just the balls you can talk to by the referee, he's wasted about a minute there, no one's going
[6602.28 - 6606.76] P:2023.80 E:0.101059 |  over to take the throw in, maybe if he's got the angry face on but it's having no effect
[6606.76 - 6611.88] P:1848.88 E:0.085062 |  whatsoever, again it's good, the one way of looking at it, it's very good game management,
[6611.88 - 6616.28] P:1767.29 E:0.092908 |  they're killing it for the Australians, you just want to get a little bit of a head of steam up
[6616.28 - 6621.56] P:1251.89 E:0.097190 |  but they're not going to be allowed to do it, are they? Montiel's throw, looking for Laudaro Martinez
[6621.56 - 6627.16] P:1489.71 E:0.088523 |  inside the penalty area, cleared away by Australia, sent back in and very calmly done, all the way
[6627.24 - 6632.76] P:1589.72 E:0.095377 |  through to Matt Ryan who launches it long over the halfway line, Suta is up there playing as a
[6632.76 - 6640.68] P:1545.72 E:0.090927 |  centre half now, playing as a centre forward now, the Stokeman needs must, they need a goal, Australia
[6640.68 - 6645.40] P:1706.78 E:0.099053 |  caution to the wind time from Graham Arnold and his men, the ball's gone out of play though for an
[6645.40 - 6651.96] P:1572.41 E:0.098745 |  Argentina throw, needs parking instructions, Graham Arnold, two minutes of added time have been played,
[6651.96 - 6657.56] P:1772.28 E:0.101480 |  Argentina two, Australia one on five, live in BBC sounds, there's the chance no messy field
[6657.56 - 6663.08] P:1732.32 E:0.106681 |  ball ahead of them on the right, yep here he comes, through to Laudaro Martinez, could say by
[6663.08 - 6668.12] P:1655.94 E:0.096842 |  Matt Ryan, will spin out for Argentina on the right hand side, they're out of the penalty area
[6668.12 - 6673.24] P:1442.59 E:0.091106 |  though and the gold shirts are getting back for Australia and Argentina, we'll just slow it down
[6673.24 - 6679.32] P:1480.14 E:0.090913 |  and play it to Enzo Fernandez, who whips it out to the right hand side where it's well controlled
[6679.40 - 6685.80] P:1515.95 E:0.087564 |  by Montiel, once more Argentina come forward, Aaron Moy gets a foot in, forward to Jackson Irvine,
[6685.80 - 6690.68] P:1602.20 E:0.092896 |  he manages to squeeze it through to Jamie McLaren, Suta playing as a centre forward, doesn't win the
[6690.68 - 6696.28] P:1678.76 E:0.103426 |  header on halfway and Argentina keep it in on the right hand side, here is Messi off he goes again,
[6696.28 - 6700.92] P:1664.40 E:0.100477 |  taking on Aaron Moy, almost getting passed in right hand side of the penalty area now,
[6700.92 - 6708.68] P:1807.75 E:0.100087 |  is Messi, goes for the colour and it wasn't too far away, oh he's ridiculous, it's in the last
[6708.68 - 6715.08] P:1780.05 E:0.099665 |  few minutes when it's got tight, he's just created two utterly clear cut chances for his mates,
[6715.08 - 6719.40] P:1644.96 E:0.096081 |  had they made it for him it'd have been a goal, right 100% he'd have scored that, this time he's
[6719.40 - 6723.40] P:1700.60 E:0.090594 |  done, I'm not doing that, I'm trying to do it myself, he has come mighty close again.
[6724.68 - 6729.08] P:1550.19 E:0.099433 |  Cleared away by Otomenzi under pressure from Suta on the edge of his own penalty area,
[6729.88 - 6735.24] P:1670.63 E:0.094761 |  three of the minimum seven minutes have been played, Australia really stretched to the back
[6735.24 - 6740.28] P:1646.76 E:0.092627 |  now because they have to throw the golden shirts forward and Argentina coming down the right once
[6740.28 - 6745.48] P:1446.05 E:0.091556 |  more with Messi, Rodrigo de Paul back to Messi once more and the two of them just slow the play
[6745.48 - 6750.20] P:1483.94 E:0.103593 |  down and this is agonising for Australia, they need to win possession but they haven't been able to
[6750.20 - 6754.84] P:1612.31 E:0.103688 |  do so and Argentina are looking to wrap this up, it's in towards that, Taro Martinez cleared away,
[6754.84 - 6759.32] P:1677.80 E:0.101067 |  shot driven in on the follow up, blocked again by Australia, they're retired, legs out there now,
[6759.32 - 6765.08] P:1616.02 E:0.088871 |  lovely skill by Ande Fernandez, almost dispossessed by Trostich, played through into the penalty area,
[6765.08 - 6769.96] P:1540.98 E:0.099800 |  once more for Argentina, again the block is made, this time by Rolls on Messi but they still come
[6769.96 - 6776.28] P:1681.04 E:0.105730 |  down Taro Martinez again and the deflection saved by Ryan and the follow up is dragged wide, it came
[6776.28 - 6781.08] P:1617.74 E:0.104861 |  to Messi quickly but he's pulled it wide and it's a deflection there, at the other end it
[6781.08 - 6786.68] P:1505.67 E:0.101223 |  cost Argentina and gave Australia a goal, that time Ryan adjusted brilliantly in his own penalty
[6786.68 - 6791.00] P:1548.87 E:0.091650 |  area, otherwise that was three-one Argentina, three to the quarterfinals, definitely.
[6791.00 - 6795.64] P:1733.32 E:0.092611 |  Do you know the last five minutes, Argentina have played like a team that could win the World Cup,
[6795.64 - 6799.96] P:1785.12 E:0.104236 |  just the last five minutes, other than that you know there have been you know good periods or
[6799.96 - 6805.48] P:1754.22 E:0.095662 |  poor other periods, the last five maybe even 10 minutes when Messi's decided to turn it on,
[6805.48 - 6810.76] P:1840.94 E:0.097631 |  they have been fabulous. Here come Australia though, Karatec's ball into the area looking for
[6810.76 - 6817.16] P:1673.04 E:0.097210 |  Suta, cleared away by Otimendi, Australia try and come again with Bennett, brave defending at the back,
[6817.16 - 6822.76] P:1591.81 E:0.103979 |  by Argentina, Aramoy gets the 14, the ball goes out of play for an Argentina throw and just on
[6822.76 - 6827.88] P:1605.57 E:0.101513 |  Aramoy he's not had the influence that we saw him have particularly against Tunisia but also against
[6827.88 - 6833.00] P:1712.46 E:0.100987 |  Denmark. Yeah but part of his job is to kill the space that Messi was getting into and he kind of
[6833.00 - 6838.12] P:1678.75 E:0.103472 |  sacrificed himself for a lot of the game just killing that space, we didn't hear a lot from Messi,
[6838.12 - 6842.76] P:1773.49 E:0.103076 |  Maia's now pushed a little bit further forward and as soon as he's left that position Messi's
[6842.76 - 6848.44] P:1644.88 E:0.096171 |  having a party and you don't know whether to stick a twist in that situation but he's just got a
[6848.44 - 6853.96] P:1701.50 E:0.098398 |  bigger chance and hope that Messi doesn't score or create a goal and you get one more chance
[6853.96 - 6860.92] P:1554.26 E:0.092842 |  you're running out of time though. 90 seconds of added time left to play, the Argentina fans are
[6860.92 - 6867.64] P:1625.89 E:0.090593 |  starting the party inside the Ahmed bin Ali stadium and every clearance, every error is cheered now
[6867.64 - 6874.60] P:1529.43 E:0.093426 |  as they send it up to Walthough way Argentina, the hit misses it for Australia, long hoof forward,
[6874.60 - 6879.96] P:1923.24 E:0.100515 |  Ryan's out of his penalty area but there's no blue and white shirt anywhere near him, they just want
[6879.96 - 6885.64] P:2157.88 E:0.102747 |  to hold out now Argentina, they know they are almost through to the last date to face the Netherlands,
[6887.08 - 6893.24] P:1802.16 E:0.095086 |  Souter's stood up there playing as a centre forwards, comes out to Karacic, lifts it high into the
[6893.24 - 6898.68] P:1715.58 E:0.096526 |  penalty area, hooked back in by Australia, McLaren's in there, heads it on, it will bounce for Argentina,
[6898.68 - 6903.96] P:1811.86 E:0.097169 |  Quo was in there for Australia, can't get a touch on it but it will come out to Australia on this
[6903.96 - 6909.16] P:1835.34 E:0.098249 |  right hand side, good ball, crossed it down to the byline, digs out the cross, nobody's there at the
[6909.16 - 6915.88] P:1725.85 E:0.098254 |  far post, it's headed away by Montiel for Argentina, Australia picking up once more into the final
[6915.88 - 6921.40] P:1771.44 E:0.098331 |  minute of added time, ball in, Ottenendic clears and Messi picks it up, Moy gets a foot in to stop
[6921.40 - 6927.00] P:1695.05 E:0.099082 |  the Argentina counter and good win will come again, might let fly again, instead it's into the area,
[6927.00 - 6933.48] P:1764.95 E:0.109311 |  lovely touch by Durán Cuol and it's saved by Emi Martinez, there was a brilliant piece of play
[6933.48 - 6941.96] P:1732.94 E:0.098374 |  by the teenager and Martinez, it's collapsed upon by his teammates because that right at the end of
[6941.96 - 6948.28] P:1719.97 E:0.097123 |  this match was a huge save from the Aston Villa and Argentina number one. You know that is a
[6948.28 - 6953.80] P:1824.50 E:0.099736 |  brilliant save but also the fact that he's come out, he's killed all the space there, there's no
[6953.80 - 6958.92] P:1835.38 E:0.094236 |  angle he has, that's not a bad miss, that's a great save and that's great goalkeeping, just when
[6958.92 - 6962.76] P:1698.30 E:0.104421 |  you need to do the right thing, he did the right thing, I didn't know they were going to get another
[6962.76 - 6970.52] P:1685.63 E:0.088703 |  chance, he did and they couldn't take it. What's that it, we played the seven minimum added minutes,
[6970.60 - 6978.04] P:1645.94 E:0.103883 |  flag is up as Argentina race towards the penalty area and the game is up for Australia,
[6978.68 - 6985.56] P:1466.58 E:0.105779 |  the players sink to their knees, it's been a fabulous tournament for them but it ends in the
[6985.56 - 6992.68] P:1498.83 E:0.105921 |  round of 16 and Argentina are through to the quarterfinals, Messi's stream is still alive,
[6993.48 - 6999.16] P:1595.96 E:0.098714 |  they beat in Australia by two goals to one. When the game actually did get better and better as it
[6999.16 - 7004.52] P:1536.91 E:0.098229 |  went on, as many of these games have when players get tired and a lot of bad space opens up, they
[7004.52 - 7010.60] P:1540.30 E:0.099253 |  saw some of the brilliant glimpses of Messi being his magical self, there was a goal but there was
[7010.60 - 7017.40] P:1450.76 E:0.095959 |  other moments in the last 10 or 15 minutes, this is if he sets some weights and when the chance comes
[7017.40 - 7022.84] P:1528.69 E:0.103145 |  to get a lot of bad space he uses so fantastically well. He was a difference wasn't he, more than
[7022.84 - 7026.84] P:1317.23 E:0.099800 |  anyone else he was a difference, there's something we don't know, it's not going to be Romero and
[7026.84 - 7030.28] P:1463.71 E:0.093562 |  Ottoman, Ottoman the way it's meant to be, he never said it again, at the end of that game he
[7030.28 - 7035.40] P:1492.77 E:0.102130 |  every single ball in the air, he was given subtle no chances at all, but you've got to be proud of
[7035.40 - 7041.24] P:1592.51 E:0.097767 |  your Australian, he proud tonight, he fought, he battled, he chased and he frightened the life
[7041.24 - 7046.60] P:1471.18 E:0.096120 |  out of Argentina near the end, particularly in the last 20 seconds but he just couldn't do enough.
[7048.20 - 7054.68] P:1341.68 E:0.097734 |  So it's not to be late drama, it's not to be another late twist and turn, as Pat says, that
[7054.68 - 7063.56] P:1319.51 E:0.093018 |  chance for Caranquil, fine margins, very good save by Emi Martinez, but it's Messi's night once
[7063.56 - 7068.36] P:1418.03 E:0.096652 |  again, it's Argentina's night once again, they're through to the quarterfinals where they will face
[7068.36 - 7075.96] P:1413.26 E:0.095810 |  the Netherlands, it finishes, Argentina 2, Australia 1. And inside the Ahmed Bin Ali stadium the
[7075.96 - 7083.48] P:1837.78 E:0.109455 |  Argentina fans sing, I'm Argentine, it's a feeling, the feeling they will have felt at the end of that
[7083.48 - 7091.32] P:1821.76 E:0.105931 |  game was nervous as Australia had the best of chances to equal this and take it into extra time,
[7091.32 - 7098.60] P:1779.06 E:0.103985 |  but Argentina are through, Pat, an exhausting game to watch at the end and you just wonder what this
[7098.60 - 7103.16] P:1809.93 E:0.092001 |  is taking out of those players? Yeah well they've asked a lot of questions, they tried to manage the
[7103.16 - 7107.72] P:1618.00 E:0.102244 |  game with the Argentinians and they did for periods of it, and you know things are really
[7107.72 - 7112.76] P:1576.77 E:0.100550 |  impressed me about Argentina, there was other things, maybe less so, that last 10 or 15 minutes,
[7112.76 - 7118.12] P:1506.19 E:0.097425 |  they stick in your mind a lot of it because it was last 10 or 15, and Messi was brilliant,
[7118.12 - 7123.08] P:1603.64 E:0.100713 |  and the chances they made were phenomenal, and they should have scored 2 or 3 maybe even 4 goals
[7123.08 - 7128.20] P:1630.46 E:0.106958 |  in that period, and it maybe tells you something, they're managing that game, they're managing the
[7128.20 - 7132.84] P:1647.83 E:0.102385 |  tournament, they're maybe growing into it, but there are weaknesses there and everyone else would have
[7132.84 - 7138.04] P:1665.59 E:0.095239 |  sponsored the weaknesses, I do feel sorry for the Australians, massively sorry for them, they put
[7138.04 - 7143.16] P:1601.81 E:0.103670 |  every effort in, but they needed a wee bit more quality didn't they? And they are very flat in the
[7143.16 - 7148.36] P:1733.66 E:0.106456 |  centre circle as they shuffle around just chatting to each other and grabbing hold of each other,
[7148.36 - 7154.76] P:1665.83 E:0.107047 |  meanwhile Argentina players are down at the far end in front of their most fervent supporters,
[7155.32 - 7160.36] P:1720.93 E:0.112669 |  the Boca Juniors, the River Plate Ultras are united inside that group, they're standing together
[7160.36 - 7166.28] P:1758.60 E:0.108082 |  towards the left of the goal, and the Argentina players, the Argentina fans are as one as they
[7166.28 - 7170.68] P:1765.68 E:0.104948 |  sing one of their most famous songs to each other, the fans are singing it to the players,
[7170.68 - 7175.88] P:1773.80 E:0.095972 |  the players are singing it back to them, they are bouncing, those Argentina fans have been
[7175.88 - 7180.60] P:1753.89 E:0.099059 |  fantastic throughout this tournament, and they have cause for celebration this evening, because
[7180.60 - 7185.80] P:1829.98 E:0.105718 |  not only have they won the game, not only are they through to the quarter finals, they will have seen
[7185.80 - 7193.64] P:1837.95 E:0.093371 |  flashes of a team that as Pat said in commentary, are able to win the World Cup, there are problems
[7193.64 - 7200.12] P:1870.57 E:0.096756 |  there, there are weaknesses that can be exploited and that show of emotion at the end is as much
[7200.12 - 7205.08] P:1890.91 E:0.093364 |  relief as anything Pat. Yeah but you see all the other countries are getting close on that,
[7205.08 - 7210.36] P:1766.19 E:0.103294 |  and they're organised, they're fit, and they've got a lot of belief, there's a lack of fear,
[7210.92 - 7215.32] P:1751.82 E:0.100792 |  a real lack of fear from everyone, you know, Brazil think they can go and send out a second team
[7215.32 - 7220.28] P:1684.24 E:0.098414 |  and win, no you can't, you can go and play against Australia, think well they used to be minors,
[7220.28 - 7224.12] P:1672.13 E:0.107031 |  well not they're not, they were going push it, and even if they're two and all down,
[7224.12 - 7228.04] P:1711.69 E:0.092476 |  they will still keep on fighting and pushing, now the better team won in the day, they will have
[7228.04 - 7232.60] P:1780.28 E:0.096331 |  the better team and they're not taking anything away from them, but you need to keep on going for it,
[7232.60 - 7238.36] P:1750.70 E:0.089711 |  and the weakness that I see is the fact that I don't know if they could keep on going for 90 minutes,
[7238.36 - 7242.84] P:1808.91 E:0.095130 |  and that's that might come back to haunt the Argentinians, and the problem in the past has been
[7243.40 - 7248.04] P:1897.60 E:0.087091 |  not enough strength and depth, and other teams, be it the French, be it you know,
[7248.04 - 7253.80] P:1880.61 E:0.092886 |  dare I say it, the Brazilians themselves, maybe even England have got real strength and depth
[7253.80 - 7259.80] P:1797.51 E:0.089186 |  in every single position, and that might actually come home to haunt Argentina, but at the moment
[7259.80 - 7264.60] P:1821.28 E:0.089110 |  they don't care, if they keep Messi fit, they don't care about the other 10 most of the time.
[7265.40 - 7270.28] P:1847.01 E:0.107312 |  1000 games for Lino Messi, he scored, he opened the scoring for Argentina,
[7270.36 - 7274.76] P:1773.15 E:0.106661 |  he's smiling at the side of the pitch, more a smile of relief, and just a couple of minutes
[7274.76 - 7282.92] P:1807.19 E:0.101345 |  before he puffed out his cheeks and just blew a sigh of relief, because he knows that Argentina
[7282.92 - 7287.96] P:1727.78 E:0.100859 |  had a let-off at the end of that game, they go through though, 2-1 there in the quarterfinals,
[7287.96 - 7294.28] P:1818.31 E:0.096847 |  will react to their victory over Australia, and will react to the game in which the Netherlands
[7294.28 - 7300.20] P:1712.98 E:0.107995 |  beat the USA by three goals to one, which sets them up for a quarter-final against Argentina,
[7300.20 - 7305.32] P:1766.43 E:0.108881 |  as the Argentina players go again in terms of the celebrations, they've moved on to a different
[7305.32 - 7310.92] P:1771.42 E:0.092455 |  section of the Argentina fans, we'll be back here at the Ahmed Ben Ali Stadium after the BBC News with
[7310.92 - 7311.88] P:1823.48 E:0.022565 |  Karl Hartley.
