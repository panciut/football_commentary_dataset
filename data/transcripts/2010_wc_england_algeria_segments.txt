[0.00 - 6.72] P:1870.39 E:0.103266 |  Well, hopefully England will be able to breathe a little more easily here tonight at sea level away from the altitude of
[7.32 - 10.88] P:1916.34 E:0.088169 |  Rustenberg also the fact that that first game is out of the way
[11.24 - 16.08] P:1952.54 E:0.091929 |  The only green provided here this evening will be the green of Algeria
[16.08 - 22.84] P:1968.00 E:0.089994 |  Robert Green in the England goal has made way for David James after all the speculation one of three changes to the England lineup
[22.84 - 26.68] P:1958.38 E:0.085036 |  James for green the other changes Carragher in for the injured King and
[27.32 - 29.32] P:1903.17 E:0.093802 |  Barry back after injury
[29.76 - 35.48] P:1900.96 E:0.092111 |  Starting in place of Milner the England lineup is James Johnson Carragher Terry and Ashley Cole
[36.12 - 38.12] P:1895.61 E:0.098251 |  Lampard Barry Lennon
[38.32 - 40.32] P:1977.50 E:0.101534 |  Rooney Gerard and Heskey
[41.44 - 46.96] P:1977.47 E:0.100419 |  Algeria have made a couple of changes and they've also brought in two very very inexperienced players
[47.60 - 49.20] P:1919.63 E:0.092206 |  umboy in goal
[49.20 - 53.08] P:1923.66 E:0.092546 |  Who plays in Bulgaria winning only his second cap comes in for Chowchee and
[53.68 - 56.72] P:1910.66 E:0.102897 |  Budubuz is in for Djibor and he's also very
[57.40 - 62.16] P:2010.59 E:0.083479 |  Inexperienced highly thought of though only 20 plays in France for Sosho
[62.16 - 69.04] P:1955.77 E:0.086931 |  None of the Algerian starting lineup play in Algeria their lineup is umboy Yahya the captain
[70.00 - 73.92] P:1911.18 E:0.090800 |  Bugera who plays for Rangers obviously in Scotland Hallish
[74.56 - 80.80] P:1926.73 E:0.092420 |  Bell has one of the two Portsmouth players who's like Fabio Capello celebrating a birthday today 28 today
[81.36 - 83.36] P:1838.19 E:0.073805 |  Cadir Lassen
[83.44 - 87.84] P:1997.47 E:0.097094 |  Ziani the playmaker from Wolfsburg in Germany. He's got champions league experience
[88.04 - 90.04] P:1810.08 E:0.081182 |  Yeah, the other Pompey player
[90.28 - 92.40] P:1906.70 E:0.084471 |  mutt more and Budubuz the
[93.00 - 100.44] P:1937.77 E:0.084934 |  Referee is just 32 years of age Ravshan Ermitov with Speck Astan took charge of the opening game South Africa
[101.00 - 102.60] P:1802.67 E:0.060686 |  against Mexico
[102.60 - 104.04] P:1847.67 E:0.058653 |  so Chris
[104.04 - 106.88] P:1821.88 E:0.088663 |  Do you think England will be a little more relaxes evening?
[107.00 - 113.64] P:1837.54 E:0.095506 |  I would like to think so but the result in the first game didn't really go to court the plan and we thought England would have three points
[114.12 - 119.04] P:1837.80 E:0.098562 |  I've been interested to see how this to this Algerian team's been coming up on the TV monitor
[119.24 - 125.44] P:1823.20 E:0.094291 |  They've had everybody playing everywhere to me. It looks like it does look like it's rain Bellage is gonna play left wing back
[126.04 - 130.96] P:1892.56 E:0.102115 |  But at least you they've got down here as a left-sided player is gonna play in the middle of the back for her back three
[131.16 - 135.28] P:1895.45 E:0.095820 |  But saying that Bellage has gone into a four for Garrett does play right back occasionally
[136.24 - 137.96] P:1921.34 E:0.091935 |  England all in white
[137.96 - 144.00] P:1886.64 E:0.092592 |  Algeria all in green the countries have never met before England have never been beaten by an
[144.56 - 146.08] P:1809.74 E:0.077040 |  African side
[146.08 - 149.84] P:1880.84 E:0.084974 |  The referee just waiting for the go ahead to start the game
[151.28 - 153.68] P:1966.11 E:0.105515 |  Algeria remember beginning with a 1-0 defeat
[154.20 - 161.04] P:1915.14 E:0.083792 |  Against Slovenia that was a goalkeeping mistake as well and that has cost the goalkeeper Chowchi his place tonight
[161.84 - 165.00] P:1958.11 E:0.092024 |  England with so much experience in this starting lineup
[165.52 - 169.92] P:1950.18 E:0.092821 |  Seven players with over 50 caps if you're just joining our commentary on five live
[169.96 - 176.24] P:1931.05 E:0.091042 |  The headline is that David James returns to the England goal the players are looking very anxious here to start
[176.84 - 179.44] P:1991.19 E:0.096227 |  Still we wait for permission to begin this game
[180.12 - 184.76] P:1943.44 E:0.102310 |  Earlier remember Slovenia to USA to if England could win this game 2-0
[185.20 - 188.60] P:1938.76 E:0.097807 |  They will go top of the group and actually only a draw would be necessary
[188.88 - 191.68] P:1977.67 E:0.084786 |  against Slovenia in the final game to qualify but
[192.44 - 194.80] P:2013.69 E:0.091985 |  England need to concentrate on doing the job here
[195.64 - 200.08] P:2022.54 E:0.089795 |  Still we wait Rune's looking very very impatient in this first half
[200.40 - 207.72] P:1952.37 E:0.091613 |  England here in Cape Town will play from left to right in this fantastic stadium in the city where Fabio Capello learned the draw and
[208.00 - 211.32] P:1918.43 E:0.093352 |  Thought that the draw was going to be quite benevolent and quite kind to them
[211.44 - 216.28] P:1943.23 E:0.094286 |  But after the 1-1 against the USA, it's a little more awkward away. We go finally
[216.64 - 219.40] P:1996.76 E:0.096776 |  And England try and get possession for the first time
[219.80 - 222.60] P:2017.33 E:0.098626 |  Lampar's given it away though down the far side the field
[222.60 - 229.52] P:1927.91 E:0.085108 |  It's with number 21 cad here when Ashley Cole gets an interception Chris Waddle all the time here is looking for clues to see
[229.52 - 231.52] P:1896.99 E:0.091822 |  The way that Algeria going to play
[231.88 - 235.96] P:1973.95 E:0.085436 |  But it does look as if they're going to play the players in their normal positions
[236.48 - 243.16] P:2000.36 E:0.092862 |  Algeria now building on the edge of the England penalty area. It's the new man Buddha boost turning now down that right-hand side
[243.16 - 245.40] P:1960.20 E:0.086760 |  And England have made it sluggish start here
[245.40 - 250.80] P:1959.35 E:0.089170 |  They need to get a challenger in the penalty area Ashley Cole turns away from Cadir and all he can do is find touch
[250.80 - 254.64] P:2004.69 E:0.084996 |  Well England have started poorly in recent matches in recent friendly games
[255.08 - 259.72] P:1892.26 E:0.088710 |  But already Algeria have had all of the possession from the kickoff as Bugera then
[259.80 - 263.44] P:2019.50 E:0.083111 |  Ways to pass through and David James all in yellow is not going to get his first touch
[263.44 - 266.12] P:1942.06 E:0.084887 |  He's going to take a goal kick. Well, we know we England play
[266.12 - 268.56] P:1876.09 E:0.088016 |  We've been looking at Algeria the plane of four
[268.96 - 274.08] P:1885.51 E:0.094471 |  The two in front of the back four red basically the plane of four five one and they're going to pack them in field with three
[274.08 - 276.72] P:1862.29 E:0.096140 |  They're going to let England have it and they've got Mammo up front
[277.00 - 280.08] P:1851.13 E:0.092908 |  Mammo for me was very quick in there. He has got a goal in them
[280.64 - 283.68] P:1961.83 E:0.089800 |  See Arnie who often plays in the hole behind the strikers
[284.00 - 289.08] P:1851.30 E:0.089047 |  Taking up a position at the moment down this left-hand side the ball into the man in purple for the first time in goal
[289.08 - 291.28] P:1908.05 E:0.073286 |  And boy making his first start
[291.28 - 296.12] P:1884.04 E:0.081015 |  That's quite an ask isn't it in the World Cup and he clears now right footed into the England half
[296.24 - 297.88] P:1882.34 E:0.086055 |  Carragall will try and win the header in fact
[297.88 - 302.20] P:1915.06 E:0.087023 |  It's beaten everybody and it goes through once more to David James England looking to put their first real
[302.40 - 308.88] P:1973.06 E:0.081920 |  Moves together here in this game in Cape Town on five live Glenn Johnson below on the England right ball played in
[309.16 - 311.56] P:1920.33 E:0.089066 |  Towards Heskey. It wasn't well delivered by Johnson though
[311.84 - 315.40] P:1886.33 E:0.084409 |  Halisha against Heskey and it's gone through once more to the Algerian key
[315.40 - 319.24] P:1829.64 E:0.096361 |  That's two deliveries wasn't it Garith Barry played one through to the goal keep on Ben Johnson
[319.24 - 321.64] P:1753.69 E:0.087490 |  I still think England they've got a little bit of nerves about
[322.44 - 328.64] P:1861.50 E:0.089586 |  Well, we've seen it so many times if only England could just settle down if they once more are gripped by tension
[328.64 - 335.68] P:1877.31 E:0.083703 |  Perhaps they haven't been helped by the late announcement once more all the team that just to repeat once more Gerard is now back on that left
[335.68 - 339.64] P:1990.72 E:0.088200 |  Sided position with license to Rome. It's Rooney and Heskey Lenin to the right
[340.12 - 347.08] P:1917.23 E:0.082531 |  Lampard and particularly Barry at the sitting players in midfield and England now looking to try and settle down here
[347.48 - 348.88] P:1897.72 E:0.071270 |  fantastic support
[348.88 - 349.84] P:1853.13 E:0.074791 |  wonderful
[349.84 - 357.12] P:2078.50 E:0.090585 |  Mild evening for them no excuses really as Ashley Cole now has possession and the board is played by Barry to Rooney for the first time
[357.20 - 362.08] P:1961.82 E:0.091617 |  Rooney up against Baguio Ashley Cole tumbles over out of play think he's got a free kick over on the far side
[362.48 - 364.48] P:1996.43 E:0.093177 |  Baguio was the man who was guilty
[364.48 - 370.72] P:1980.95 E:0.088327 |  So here's a chance for England to test the Algerian defenders certainly the goalkeeper who played before Chouchi was a bit of a flapper in
[370.72 - 374.16] P:1909.44 E:0.085942 |  Goal here's a chance now for Gerard to put one in and try and travel
[374.32 - 379.80] P:1916.00 E:0.086153 |  Umboy on his first start Rooney and Heskey on the edge of the area and now a late run from John Terry
[379.80 - 382.48] P:1961.21 E:0.103319 |  Remember England started well with an early goal against the USA
[382.84 - 386.48] P:1970.93 E:0.085841 |  Steven Gerard then with a free kick for England looking for Heskey
[386.80 - 393.40] P:1886.76 E:0.087766 |  Algeria trying to clear here still inside the penalty area now perhaps a counterattack on for them as Bugira knocks it forward
[393.44 - 398.96] P:1927.48 E:0.092107 |  But it was well read by Gareth Barry then in comes a lunging challenge over on the far side referee was happy with it though
[399.12 - 404.40] P:1958.02 E:0.077346 |  And it's a throw in only to Algeria and it's about ten yards from the half wayline
[404.40 - 406.92] P:1820.00 E:0.083711 |  It was a nice pass from Gareth Barry a few months ago
[406.92 - 411.60] P:1873.50 E:0.085786 |  Not such a good touch on the ball though now from Bugira England have a throw in far side the left nil nil
[411.72 - 414.28] P:1797.80 E:0.089603 |  I'm still trying to work out. They are tight three at the back
[414.28 - 419.76] P:1814.38 E:0.085584 |  I've got to say cadieres coming back and picking Gerard up and Bellard just playing on the left side come come full back
[419.76 - 420.96] P:1865.19 E:0.054005 |  Come wing back
[420.96 - 425.24] P:1991.50 E:0.079305 |  Well, both of these coaches will have done piles of homework coming into this matches down
[425.24 - 429.64] P:1974.10 E:0.089585 |  John Terry Bringland tries to steer the ball forward in England looking to settle their nerves down
[429.64 - 433.44] P:2042.77 E:0.090527 |  And it's Steven Gerard now with a high one and it's too high towards the goalkeeper
[433.44 - 437.32] P:2004.73 E:0.088738 |  But he was backtracking a bit there his positioning wasn't great and he had to stretch and in the end
[437.32 - 442.76] P:1938.43 E:0.091675 |  It was a clean catch for the new man umboy in the Algeria goal. I wasn't convinced
[442.76 - 445.68] P:1830.41 E:0.101834 |  It wasn't I thought it just got past him, but he held on to it
[446.68 - 451.64] P:1901.03 E:0.091378 |  Algeria getting plenty of men back behind the ball as they now try and build in midfield
[451.64 - 454.36] P:1978.73 E:0.079314 |  It's with Belhage the Portsmouth left back
[454.92 - 455.88] P:1800.54 E:0.087465 |  Algeria
[455.88 - 457.36] P:2052.88 E:0.094018 |  motioning immediately
[457.36 - 464.28] P:1971.33 E:0.091258 |  Instinctively to go backwards once more and a clearance as a terrible clearance from the goalkeeper that can Rooney take advantage two defenders in his way
[464.28 - 469.48] P:1984.13 E:0.092462 |  Rooney finds Gerard. Oh Gerard tried to return it to Lampard instead of having a crack himself and
[469.84 - 471.20] P:1992.56 E:0.103002 |  Algeria let off the hook there
[471.20 - 476.08] P:2000.77 E:0.095743 |  But that was a terribly nervous clearance by the goalkeeper umboy England ill Algeria nil on five live
[476.36 - 479.28] P:2051.28 E:0.088537 |  Algeria now trying to escape England having to backtrack
[479.28 - 485.20] P:1982.00 E:0.091561 |  They've got speedy players in midfield and it's an excellent run down the far side by Muckmore England just for the moment out of position
[485.36 - 490.88] P:1960.66 E:0.093433 |  Matt Moore drives it back Boota Boos was almost there England got a foot in and that was a very very
[491.28 - 494.96] P:1898.54 E:0.093852 |  Pacy counterattack there from Algeria. Well, that's how England get caught out
[494.96 - 499.24] P:1788.82 E:0.095522 |  Don't know was it says the Arnie will pick it up terrific running release man boy. He should have hit it
[499.40 - 501.40] P:1688.23 E:0.072540 |  He should have hit it the young boy
[502.44 - 504.44] P:1921.59 E:0.089825 |  Algeria throwing number 21
[504.52 - 508.24] P:1984.71 E:0.086068 |  Caddier to take it far side the right on to the 20 year old
[508.40 - 514.44] P:2100.47 E:0.088688 |  Boota Boos a good ball into the unmarked player in midfield whose shot is charged down and now Glenn Johnson looking to try and bring some
[515.36 - 519.36] P:1970.38 E:0.091176 |  Star to the England side is put one down this right hand side for Heskey to chase
[519.36 - 522.76] P:1994.45 E:0.090572 |  Heskey turning with a defender try to play it into Iron Lennon
[523.36 - 528.44] P:2006.26 E:0.083948 |  Johnson fails to get possession on the half wayline and it's back inside the England half once more with Carragher England
[528.44 - 532.12] P:1973.02 E:0.088412 |  They're Algeria nil but just a couple of moments on the break already for me
[532.20 - 535.76] P:2021.36 E:0.086186 |  Algerians to show that they are very quick on the counterattack most of these players
[536.24 - 540.28] P:1986.46 E:0.085310 |  French French born opted to play for Algeria 17 in the squad
[540.72 - 546.64] P:1964.14 E:0.093594 |  Born in France Ashley Cole now cutting it for England down the left-hand side appeal the handball there against the defender
[546.88 - 553.60] P:1984.63 E:0.090520 |  But cleared by Algeria Ashley Cole made a really good run and so Gerard will have to cover now over on the left-hand side
[554.08 - 557.88] P:2033.39 E:0.086618 |  Cole under Gerard there together John Terry was there as well
[557.88 - 563.12] P:1941.46 E:0.088753 |  And so instinctively when Ashley Cole went forward Gerard filled in now to put this good movement
[563.12 - 564.32] P:1917.18 E:0.093834 |  Ashley Cole's got forward well
[564.32 - 568.52] P:1812.40 E:0.097540 |  I'm trying to get Lenin and Heskey's got looked after ball a little bit better already give it away cheaply
[568.52 - 571.80] P:1988.85 E:0.083270 |  Oh nice pass there by Barry, but Rooney couldn't take it and bell has now
[572.04 - 579.22] P:1936.34 E:0.081960 |  Feeds buggera and buggera all on his own at the moment brings it forward and then Algeria looked to map more inside the centre circle
[579.46 - 584.34] P:1978.65 E:0.089062 |  Algeria playing from right to left here a ball to this near side towards the Arnie can't control it though with his head
[584.34 - 590.98] P:1915.96 E:0.080832 |  And it's going to be an England throw England still haven't settled down yet completely and a couple of times Algeria
[590.98 - 593.48] P:1836.32 E:0.065429 |  Have been neat and quick on the break
[594.30 - 597.88] P:1915.35 E:0.078143 |  So there could be some testing moments for John Terry and Jamie Carragher
[598.38 - 602.78] P:1926.00 E:0.078851 |  Gareth Barry certainly will be needed on his return to try and give some protection to the back for you
[602.78 - 606.34] P:1981.62 E:0.083404 |  Listen to five live at the World Cup the final game of this day England nil
[606.78 - 612.66] P:1946.11 E:0.087380 |  Algeria nil England second game in the group. It's a must-win game really now as Gerard tries to cut the ball out over on the far side
[612.66 - 615.98] P:1956.78 E:0.084577 |  The field it's with number seven Buddha booths turning around Gareth Barry
[616.26 - 619.58] P:1955.85 E:0.087187 |  Decent pass here from Matt Moore Matt Moore now on to the Arnie's
[619.58 - 622.82] P:2034.17 E:0.081127 |  You're not he's just forced to go square Johnson harrying him well
[622.82 - 627.22] P:1982.41 E:0.091178 |  But now the Arnie goes forward once more and Lenin has conceded a corner
[628.06 - 630.34] P:2014.05 E:0.095109 |  Algeria's first near side the left
[630.38 - 633.46] P:1925.74 E:0.103281 |  Selling what makes so far I'll do a little very dangerous out of it
[633.46 - 637.82] P:1877.39 E:0.098875 |  They're very comfortable in possession one and two to a sport what they've got a bit of pace about them as well
[639.22 - 641.22] P:1972.79 E:0.084007 |  And they have their first corner
[641.22 - 643.58] P:1904.98 E:0.086365 |  And it's going to be taken by the Arnie
[643.58 - 648.52] P:1936.46 E:0.088132 |  It's a dreadful corner and Gerard at the near post will stab it clear so no testing moment there for David James
[648.86 - 653.46] P:1906.91 E:0.079786 |  And that was a big opportunity wasted by Algeria nil nil here in Cape Town
[653.66 - 658.02] P:1951.53 E:0.083146 |  Throw in now and the ball lifted into the England penalty area John Terry climbs
[658.02 - 660.90] P:1945.03 E:0.079685 |  But Algeria still have possession down that right-hand side
[660.90 - 666.20] P:1876.63 E:0.076235 |  It's Kadir playing over on the right up against Ashley Cole ball back again with Buddha booths
[666.42 - 671.34] P:1932.48 E:0.077519 |  Some good movement at times here from the North African side ball now into the England penalty area
[671.34 - 676.26] P:1954.23 E:0.076064 |  Which Johnson can leave and it's going to be a goal kick but already only seven minutes gone
[676.54 - 681.66] P:1912.92 E:0.081611 |  We've seen enough here of Algeria to illustrate that they could be a handful
[681.66 - 686.38] P:1789.03 E:0.085182 |  I think they are who the bulls are start the game for a young lad very very well technically excellent
[686.38 - 688.62] P:1655.78 E:0.078082 |  And as I say they've got a bit of pace about them
[688.62 - 693.52] P:1959.27 E:0.080339 |  So when England do lose a position high up the field there is Gupt and they're filling their midfield to yet
[693.52 - 695.52] P:2052.93 E:0.068629 |  Doris he is just controlling that
[695.62 - 701.14] P:2041.71 E:0.089005 |  Central area in front of the back four and England yet to really build up a momentum here in Cape Town
[701.42 - 706.26] P:2064.80 E:0.081418 |  Lampard for England good ball now on to Barry now can Barry play it to this right-hand side
[706.34 - 711.58] P:1990.45 E:0.086735 |  Johnson's there now he almost stumbled but now Johnson can play it in towards Lenin and it goes off the defender Halleesh
[712.58 - 716.46] P:1884.47 E:0.077519 |  Not just to be a back pass he got his put in and goalkeeper number 23
[716.46 - 720.62] P:1884.10 E:0.076588 |  Umbo is there to throw to the far side the field to the captain yeah here
[720.62 - 725.10] P:1897.06 E:0.073737 |  He was the man who got the goal against Egypt in the playoff game in Sudan now
[725.38 - 730.12] P:1884.50 E:0.077571 |  It's Yebda of Portsmouth to the unmarked Buddha booth England need to tighten up a bit in midfield
[731.06 - 735.74] P:1922.74 E:0.084408 |  Funding it hard here at times England getting out numbered a little bit in that middle area as the Arnie now
[735.74 - 741.26] P:1930.16 E:0.082013 |  Chases across to the far side the field and England managed to dispossess him fine work from there from Jamie Carragher
[741.54 - 745.58] P:1981.92 E:0.082419 |  Carragher turns Barry's touch has to be good here because he's surrounded by
[746.18 - 748.54] P:1884.89 E:0.092661 |  Algerian players and that's a thing about them
[748.54 - 752.34] P:1898.90 E:0.083283 |  They do hunt the ball well in numbers a very athletic team as well
[752.42 - 756.10] P:1938.93 E:0.085496 |  but England will be looking to try and trouble them at the other end of the field because
[756.54 - 763.34] P:1991.55 E:0.087739 |  Over the seasons they have proved to be suspect especially when the ball is put into the air in the power runy really struggling to get into game here
[763.54 - 769.58] P:2024.87 E:0.086238 |  Minute is that the ball went to him. He was surrounded by green shirts one of the Algerian players has gone down the goalkeeper though
[770.30 - 774.02] P:1917.78 E:0.082315 |  Launches it long and it's going to be a goal kick for England. They haven't stopped the game here
[774.62 - 777.74] P:1815.60 E:0.074117 |  At the moment, they're just a few problems in that center of the field for England
[778.06 - 781.50] P:1849.31 E:0.096092 |  Well, there is they're getting good possession in the move on the ball very very well
[781.50 - 786.74] P:1973.66 E:0.087188 |  I think the ideal scenario files years raining didn't do get in the final third
[786.74 - 789.22] P:1873.12 E:0.096213 |  That's when they want to pinch the ball and that's when they've looked dangerous
[790.94 - 795.46] P:2021.44 E:0.094175 |  Well, we're looking here for Wade Rooney to explode in the world cup. He's made a quietish start here today
[795.58 - 801.18] P:1916.89 E:0.086224 |  Just as he did against the USA, but we've only played just under 10 minutes now lampard near side down the line poor ball
[801.38 - 804.34] P:2004.05 E:0.073168 |  And that really just should have found its target Johnson
[804.34 - 810.50] P:1819.60 E:0.077590 |  It didn't and it was sloppy and careless there by England who still seem to be showing just a little too much
[811.06 - 816.10] P:1828.98 E:0.076064 |  Apprehension here in the first 10 minutes the results have gone their way so far today
[817.14 - 819.78] P:1948.49 E:0.084698 |  the 2-2 between America and
[820.42 - 825.14] P:1920.53 E:0.081141 |  Serbia Hesky now trying to win a corner kick and he hasn't quite got it. It's a goal kick to Algeria
[826.22 - 831.42] P:1751.51 E:0.094355 |  They want to play every time they get it there throw in Bellagio through it. He was marked by Hesky was a risky throw
[831.78 - 836.02] P:1689.67 E:0.086192 |  That's how they play they like the plate defeat. They've got good movement all technically very good
[836.18 - 839.38] P:1810.24 E:0.077054 |  But as you say discipline at the back in mark and it seems has let them down
[839.82 - 844.22] P:1920.81 E:0.078656 |  Well, there are real mix of course, Algeria a North African team playing here in South Africa
[844.90 - 851.02] P:1939.44 E:0.076035 |  Arab culture and European born players essentially that most of these players have grown up in France
[851.02 - 854.42] P:1970.57 E:0.071856 |  Perhaps realize that they weren't going to get into the French national side
[854.42 - 858.14] P:1832.49 E:0.079853 |  But they've every chance here with Algeria and they've started well
[858.14 - 862.18] P:1930.07 E:0.087298 |  But now Gerard inside the centre circle England need a bit more urgency Rooney's given it away
[862.38 - 866.46] P:1958.57 E:0.082860 |  Should have returned the past deceiving Gerard and Rooney's touch so far letting him down as now
[866.54 - 872.06] P:1923.99 E:0.077432 |  Bugira plays it down the right-hand side for Algeria Cross comes actually cold to try and cut out the danger
[872.06 - 876.22] P:1954.53 E:0.085591 |  But he hasn't and now the ball is lifted in first testing moments with David Jones with one fist
[876.22 - 882.26] P:1988.38 E:0.090407 |  He was late coming for it and England and a pickle here in the penalty area all because of a weak punch from David James
[882.26 - 888.82] P:1969.34 E:0.088442 |  That wasn't convincing now England find Rooney and now Rooney with a good ball for the first time finds Lenin on this near side
[888.82 - 890.30] P:1931.41 E:0.078799 |  And it's England counter-attacking
[890.30 - 895.30] P:2017.54 E:0.092525 |  Lenin now lays the ball off to this near side Johnson onto Hesky Rooney's in the penalty area
[895.30 - 900.46] P:1999.43 E:0.088548 |  Hesky looks up wins in the end only a corner and he might have got it in earlier for Wayne Rooney
[900.46 - 904.18] P:1971.37 E:0.097358 |  I was just gonna say the same words mate. You had time to put it in he got it on his feet
[904.30 - 906.30] P:1881.93 E:0.096178 |  Just put it in with pace a bit of a delivery
[906.98 - 910.26] P:1900.06 E:0.090703 |  Desitated they've got a corner. This is where I think England can catch the state
[910.26 - 914.18] P:2023.41 E:0.093813 |  Oh, we're always picked a lot of the big players the tall players in the Algerian squad
[914.34 - 918.22] P:2005.62 E:0.087100 |  This is where I think England may catch these out. Well, the longer the game goes on
[918.86 - 921.06] P:1980.38 E:0.101918 |  Algeria will grow more and more confident here
[921.14 - 927.66] P:1967.44 E:0.077396 |  This would be a good time for England to strike from this first corner kick of the evening to try and test the new
[928.14 - 932.06] P:1973.96 E:0.087120 |  Inexperienced goalkeeper Gareth Barry with a free kick goalkeeper doesn't come for it
[932.06 - 934.10] P:2029.88 E:0.087431 |  And Hesky rose almost too high
[934.10 - 939.86] P:1951.66 E:0.072980 |  But I think he's been penalized anyway for pushing and he headed it well over and it's a goalkeeper
[939.86 - 943.34] P:1985.36 E:0.079168 |  The keeper there was completely rooted at the spot. He wasn't gonna come for it
[943.34 - 947.38] P:1846.02 E:0.080213 |  But in the end Hesky was pulled up by the officials here. He's all over Bulgaria
[947.94 - 954.82] P:1864.33 E:0.077929 |  And Rooney was in there as well, but high over the bone but England have in recent games works that pieces very well
[955.34 - 960.06] P:1925.83 E:0.082346 |  Well, England are back in the the system that served them well in the qualifying campaign
[960.50 - 965.44] P:1962.20 E:0.081593 |  With Gerard on the left cutting in trying to link with Rooney. Hesky's there as well
[965.62 - 970.82] P:1886.64 E:0.078282 |  Gareth Barry protecting but they still haven't settled yet and they're looking to the big players here to stamp their authority
[971.30 - 977.12] P:1906.20 E:0.076780 |  Men like Frank Lampard is on the ball now Lampard sends it to the far side the field to his Chelsea
[977.46 - 983.06] P:1887.09 E:0.080266 |  Captain John Terry Terry now on to Gareth Barry Barry with his left foot long ball looking for Ashley Cole
[983.06 - 986.38] P:1959.77 E:0.080894 |  And he's been over hit has it Ashley Cole can't get there by the corner flag
[987.10 - 990.58] P:1877.68 E:0.068049 |  And they still haven't got the measure of this sir this Jabalani ball
[993.38 - 999.90] P:1849.77 E:0.083879 |  I don't really think it's the ball I think you know it tends to show everybody was played short for ball of ad result
[999.90 - 1005.14] P:1893.45 E:0.079771 |  So to our class these pitches away the water them and there with the ball. It's like playing an astroturf. You've got to play it a feet
[1006.14 - 1011.82] P:1969.34 E:0.085435 |  Jerry clear at nil nil 13 minutes gone in the first half here and a llama few moments ago with a
[1012.62 - 1018.62] P:1931.30 E:0.081993 |  Unconvincing punch from David James restored to the England lineup and England now looking for some inspiration here
[1018.62 - 1022.14] P:1915.85 E:0.080042 |  And certainly they need to climb up a gear or two here
[1022.14 - 1028.50] P:1890.47 E:0.078863 |  So it's been a slow staccato beginning from England once more looking a little bit apprehensive a little bit edgies
[1028.50 - 1034.60] P:1944.65 E:0.084389 |  Hesky's been fouled and the free kick is quickly taken referees let them do it and then Lampard expecting Lenin to make the run
[1034.96 - 1037.32] P:1876.12 E:0.083834 |  Played it to the right hand side and gave the ball away
[1037.32 - 1043.20] P:1943.42 E:0.074664 |  Hesky slow to get back up on his feet again and England didn't benefit from that quickly taken free kick as Halish now
[1043.20 - 1045.50] P:1960.32 E:0.077633 |  It's a good long ball to the far side of the field
[1046.20 - 1048.40] P:1843.30 E:0.078699 |  Algeria neat and tidy and composed
[1048.92 - 1053.24] P:1869.57 E:0.064083 |  They haven't got a really dangerous striker up front
[1053.84 - 1061.20] P:1980.04 E:0.083347 |  They've certainly runners coming through for midfield to try and test the England defenders neat ball in now for towards the Arney who's
[1061.76 - 1064.84] P:1961.14 E:0.084107 |  While in the end or a free says manhandled by Johnson free kick
[1064.84 - 1068.20] P:2118.28 E:0.090050 |  He allows Algeria to take quickly too and there's a nice change of pace here
[1068.20 - 1072.32] P:1977.41 E:0.083647 |  And then the shot is driven in from Buddha booze and it's worldwide. It was very very ambitious
[1072.72 - 1077.36] P:1949.43 E:0.078052 |  So almost 15 minutes gone in the first half. Let's get some thoughts from Graham Taylor
[1077.36 - 1082.64] P:1784.97 E:0.090744 |  Who's alongside us here tonight Graham? I have to say I like the formation that Algeria playing
[1083.24 - 1087.64] P:1856.00 E:0.089668 |  It's three at the back sometimes. It's five and when they push forward
[1087.68 - 1093.48] P:1868.53 E:0.094862 |  They've not outnumbered in midfield if they had a main threat as in the centre forward position
[1093.48 - 1097.56] P:1695.59 E:0.090212 |  I think they would have given England even more problems than they have done at the present time
[1097.56 - 1101.32] P:1852.50 E:0.089072 |  I think they've been impressive England are taking some time to settle into this
[1101.32 - 1106.20] P:1959.24 E:0.087369 |  Our own London after England bustling forward Lenin's ball and then Gerard swept it forward early and over
[1106.20 - 1110.84] P:2009.92 E:0.080087 |  But the problem here for England and Algeria had done some homework. No question. They're filling midfield
[1110.84 - 1115.24] P:1928.02 E:0.082142 |  They're going to be hard to break down and then on the counterattack. They're very quick on the break
[1115.24 - 1119.64] P:1817.16 E:0.084484 |  So there are problems here for Fabio Capello and England to try and solve. I think the pushing in
[1119.64 - 1124.96] P:1911.49 E:0.087336 |  I think that the object of playing the three goes into a four when Baladjou they're trying really just to push on to Lenin
[1124.96 - 1129.80] P:1842.12 E:0.080019 |  Push on to Gerard so they don't get the balls of fate and they're making England really force it and play longer balls
[1130.28 - 1133.44] P:1922.37 E:0.062007 |  England nil Algeria nil in this
[1134.16 - 1136.16] P:1923.57 E:0.079293 |  Huge game really because the second game
[1137.04 - 1143.00] P:1877.97 E:0.079141 |  Really can affect the shape the entire shape of the qualifying group England really have to win it
[1143.24 - 1146.88] P:1896.05 E:0.077862 |  Otherwise, it's going to be enormous pressure going into the final match
[1146.88 - 1151.04] P:1988.94 E:0.079492 |  It's nil nil and you're listening to five live and it's Jamie Carragher of England this time on to feet
[1151.04 - 1154.72] P:1937.36 E:0.086221 |  It'll spin from Lenin need more conviction than that and then and gave it away straight away
[1154.72 - 1158.76] P:1955.10 E:0.088327 |  They'll hash was there in a dangerous fallback almost putting the defender Hallease into problems
[1158.96 - 1161.36] P:1947.60 E:0.083675 |  England trying to win it back and this is what Capello wants
[1161.36 - 1164.56] P:2031.82 E:0.081587 |  He wants them to hunt the ball back in midfield as well when they give it away
[1165.00 - 1169.40] P:1912.84 E:0.076389 |  And again some of the passing early on here from England has been careless. There's a lot of
[1170.04 - 1173.28] P:2004.09 E:0.084068 |  Finger pointing down there by Stuart Pierce alongside Fabio Pello
[1174.32 - 1176.68] P:2099.62 E:0.088739 |  Algeria looking to try and play a one-two on the edge of the area
[1177.24 - 1182.84] P:2004.14 E:0.078550 |  Johnson gives it back to James and James clearance wasn't very good. It's straight back to Algeria once more and
[1183.56 - 1189.52] P:2053.95 E:0.088620 |  Ziani and that's good pace from Ziani to get away from Johnson dangerous ball in Barry was back inside the penalty area
[1189.52 - 1194.52] P:1958.11 E:0.078943 |  England haven't cleared it ball played in again by Ziani. Oh, and that was
[1195.24 - 1200.28] P:2015.07 E:0.083063 |  Frank it was Jamie Carragher who had a go at it and tell you what if he'd made contact with that
[1200.28 - 1203.92] P:2015.78 E:0.083573 |  That could have been problems for his own goalkeeper had he made any kind of
[1205.60 - 1212.68] P:2020.87 E:0.082882 |  Interceptionary he would have perhaps sliced that over James England lucky and the throw into Algeria again far side and still
[1212.68 - 1218.60] P:1798.49 E:0.081058 |  England in this performance are starting slowly too slowly our thoughts. Ziani got wrong then jump very very easy
[1218.60 - 1221.08] P:1902.25 E:0.085931 |  He didn't do a trick was just pace push the ball and run
[1221.32 - 1226.88] P:1848.54 E:0.072575 |  They look very nervous at the back England still look there's not a lot confidence though the ball's going everywhere
[1226.88 - 1232.88] P:1956.68 E:0.088994 |  It doesn't seem to be a leader there not treating the ball as a friend at the moment giving it away cheaply another ball into the England penalty
[1232.88 - 1235.80] P:2015.73 E:0.085490 |  And even that was an edgy header away by Jamie Carragher
[1235.80 - 1240.84] P:2002.44 E:0.078092 |  He could have got more distance with it and said he's headed its sideways out of play and Algeria have more
[1241.28 - 1246.58] P:1995.10 E:0.074188 |  Possession near side. It's Ziani Ziani back to the half wayline and the centre back
[1246.86 - 1250.74] P:1997.79 E:0.090247 |  Hallease Hallease is ball in which I'm not sure Terry needed to head there
[1250.74 - 1256.68] P:2016.92 E:0.084138 |  But there wasn't much communication with the goalkeeper because I don't suppose they play together much in training and now another ball back into
[1256.68 - 1262.94] P:2016.74 E:0.084248 |  The England area which James allows to bounce and then scuffs it back towards the centre circle and England at the moment a little shapeless
[1262.94 - 1265.98] P:1989.56 E:0.075766 |  And they need something here. Well, they need to make it happen for themselves
[1266.34 - 1269.14] P:2069.22 E:0.097318 |  Algeria lose out in midfield Barry strives forward
[1269.14 - 1274.58] P:1968.25 E:0.077166 |  But it's a good challenge back on Gareth Barry and Algeria very quick to recover when it back once more
[1274.78 - 1276.58] P:1984.09 E:0.075310 |  Algeria getting more possession
[1276.58 - 1281.58] P:2029.29 E:0.085707 |  Number 15 is Ziani another nice change of pace a shake of the hips to get around Johnson
[1281.58 - 1286.78] P:1911.30 E:0.092058 |  And that was approved by the Algerian fans and these are worrying moments here for Fabio Capello in England
[1286.78 - 1291.62] P:2033.14 E:0.081921 |  There's now Matt Moore 30 yards away from James goal. He shot his charge down by Carragher
[1291.62 - 1295.50] P:1987.47 E:0.076642 |  But the ball is coming back to the men in green most of the time down that far side
[1295.50 - 1302.70] P:2025.89 E:0.079726 |  It's Bagheera against Heskey England at the moment a second best Heskey trying to find Gerard now can the captain lift England Gerard onto
[1302.70 - 1308.10] P:2075.25 E:0.086997 |  Lampard lamp of sees Lenin Rooney drops forward Lenin goes inside the Algerian half
[1308.10 - 1311.02] P:2141.16 E:0.085255 |  Aaron Lenin now trying to show some pace here
[1311.02 - 1315.58] P:2053.56 E:0.086035 |  It's Gerard at the centre of midfield with a terrible pass which Bagheera clears
[1315.58 - 1319.34] P:2037.90 E:0.082920 |  It was snatched up that was by Gerard without any composure
[1319.58 - 1324.42] P:2007.94 E:0.084977 |  80 and a half minutes gone it's nil nil and here come Algeria once more Carragher trying to
[1324.90 - 1329.18] P:2013.79 E:0.082437 |  Hold up Matt Moore near side and Algeria win the thread got the same mate
[1329.18 - 1333.74] P:1926.33 E:0.077352 |  Algeria are by far the better side that they're compact the playing together
[1333.74 - 1338.38] P:1976.38 E:0.090138 |  They all know what you those game is and the move in the ball excellent wanted to touch
[1338.38 - 1342.98] P:1917.97 E:0.083349 |  They've got a lot of legs and a lot of pace in this side. They're causing so many problems England look anxious
[1342.98 - 1348.82] P:1942.26 E:0.088632 |  England look nervy as the ball comes into the England area and Terry's head are away wasn't great shot driven in from Algeria
[1348.82 - 1355.54] P:1965.11 E:0.086314 |  Could have gone anywhere England failing to clear it slow to react there was Lenin Fabio Capello is prowling down there not happy
[1355.54 - 1361.78] P:2030.91 E:0.090248 |  It's the army for Algeria Algeria's ball into the England penalty area had her on and James is there and we were looking for
[1362.10 - 1364.26] P:2017.89 E:0.086071 |  huge improvement here tonight from England and
[1364.82 - 1369.78] P:1946.37 E:0.085574 |  Capello, I think is just telling James to calm down don't launch it and lose it keep it
[1370.30 - 1373.58] P:1907.99 E:0.088593 |  19 minutes gone Lenin again now near side the right
[1373.58 - 1377.34] P:2036.61 E:0.079685 |  We've seen almost nothing of Wayne Rooney in these opening 20 minutes
[1377.34 - 1382.26] P:2024.63 E:0.090216 |  It's lampard to Barry Barry now to Rooney Rooney gave it early Gerard went forward and he was caught
[1383.02 - 1386.38] P:1996.37 E:0.086796 |  Gerard in full flight was caught and it's a free kick to England
[1386.38 - 1389.74] P:2012.55 E:0.085482 |  But it's at least 35 most 40 yards away from the Algeria
[1389.74 - 1393.22] P:1925.97 E:0.093107 |  That's the benefit you get a Gerard when he comes inside there's no doubt about that
[1393.22 - 1398.62] P:1927.86 E:0.088685 |  But it's the first real team I think England has strung three or four and I'm one of our quick passes and a bit of movement
[1399.38 - 1402.62] P:2070.90 E:0.097035 |  Gerard now following the free kick and nice touch from Rooney on the edge of the area
[1402.62 - 1405.22] P:1891.60 E:0.082196 |  Rooney trying to make an angle from shot and hit a defender
[1405.22 - 1409.22] P:2035.75 E:0.085443 |  It took all the sting out of it and it drops to the goalkeeper the interesting thing would be to see here
[1409.22 - 1414.06] P:1970.43 E:0.080164 |  Even England would have be able to go in front what effect that would have on the Algerian team
[1414.06 - 1418.18] P:1969.55 E:0.084285 |  But at the moment that's a long way from happening Algeria posing most of the dangers now
[1418.26 - 1423.38] P:2022.91 E:0.078429 |  Johnson bolleys the ball into the center circle England are giving it away too much straight back once more to the opposition
[1423.86 - 1429.98] P:1974.25 E:0.079082 |  Bell has nearside. This is the Algerian left England ill Algerian ill on five live Johnson with a header up against
[1429.98 - 1435.02] P:1992.78 E:0.075835 |  Siani who's given him quite a few problems in the opening 20 minutes and the the North Africans have a threat
[1435.46 - 1437.46] P:1859.97 E:0.095649 |  Gotta give the culture fair Algeria
[1437.46 - 1443.10] P:1891.31 E:0.084946 |  No, I looked to a great coming at this tournament that did okay against Slovenia in the first game nothing but tonight
[1443.10 - 1447.74] P:1838.88 E:0.081684 |  They've actually got the system right. Oh, we always in the break together high studs by yeah
[1448.30 - 1452.06] P:1840.50 E:0.086751 |  Lampard, but you've got to say Algeria by the team. Oh really?
[1452.06 - 1458.38] P:1859.76 E:0.067738 |  I'll pass the ball around look and threaten it if they come again down the right-hand side England now having to get players back
[1458.38 - 1463.22] P:1894.44 E:0.080215 |  But they're not picking up the Algerian players when they come forward and Bulgaria the center back is now
[1463.90 - 1467.06] P:1973.26 E:0.084909 |  Deep inside the England half, but he shows too much of that to Gareth Barry
[1467.06 - 1472.42] P:1897.34 E:0.073718 |  Barry wants to clear and gets a reasonable clearance in towards the advertising board over on the far side
[1472.74 - 1475.70] P:1803.72 E:0.077271 |  England haven't settled and we played almost a quarter of the game
[1475.82 - 1480.94] P:1973.37 E:0.087143 |  Here come the Algerians once more and they may get a shot in here driven and it was well defended though by John Terry
[1481.10 - 1482.86] P:1956.46 E:0.088810 |  England just can't get hold of the ball here
[1482.86 - 1488.60] P:1995.94 E:0.076679 |  It's Gerard against a Kedir over on the right-hand side another ball played in the England penalty area now
[1488.60 - 1493.06] P:1937.78 E:0.079958 |  Matt Moore gives it back and now lovely play from Algeria a drag back there
[1493.34 - 1497.94] P:1955.55 E:0.086523 |  Nobody really marking up for England on the edge of the penalty area comes out of play yet
[1497.94 - 1500.06] P:1964.23 E:0.075953 |  I can't get it England have a throw in and
[1500.98 - 1502.98] P:1875.90 E:0.073812 |  Capallo standing down there
[1503.14 - 1505.90] P:1930.48 E:0.097811 |  Arms folded and now motioning to Wayne Rooney
[1507.10 - 1510.42] P:1992.61 E:0.092216 |  England looking to their big stars here to impose themselves
[1510.94 - 1516.54] P:1869.77 E:0.080970 |  Lampard Jerry Gerard and Rooney in particular, but they're not getting enough of the ball here
[1516.74 - 1518.74] P:1936.17 E:0.081691 |  Even England mess the throw in up
[1519.06 - 1523.26] P:2011.32 E:0.079427 |  Halish now ball to this near side which Johnson lets travel forward and
[1523.66 - 1526.02] P:2006.17 E:0.088979 |  It hits the corner flag and stays in play
[1526.46 - 1532.46] P:1982.21 E:0.081927 |  Carragher has to be quick here to react Carragher's ball in the end is shoveled out of play for an Algeria throw in
[1532.66 - 1541.02] P:1991.61 E:0.074426 |  Halfway inside the England half troubling times here, but it is still nil nil ball with bell has you just pinching a few yards down
[1541.02 - 1543.02] P:1953.03 E:0.065438 |  This near side to take the throw in
[1543.50 - 1546.06] P:2003.06 E:0.087940 |  Carragher now trying to mark up on the edge of the penalty area
[1546.06 - 1551.90] P:2025.51 E:0.083845 |  But Matt Moore is dangerous and Carragher hasn't managed to get it away still danger here bell has with across to the far post
[1552.02 - 1557.78] P:2001.79 E:0.078115 |  Too deep for any Algerian players. It's the halfway point of the first half. It's nil nil and here now comes Alan Green
[1558.18 - 1562.34] P:1875.35 E:0.087233 |  As we hear across the ball into the penalty area yep diggers is right put to it
[1562.34 - 1566.38] P:1900.64 E:0.076090 |  But it's a high log really it's taking the reflection. It's gonna be a corner
[1566.38 - 1570.58] P:1953.79 E:0.092831 |  I think they come on John Terry terrific ball in by McGehran. It's all not cheer you got to say
[1570.58 - 1574.46] P:1932.48 E:0.083163 |  It's got a body who plays it away, but it's the same problem we had in
[1575.18 - 1577.18] P:1975.11 E:0.092408 |  When we played at Russamberg against America
[1577.18 - 1582.26] P:2007.35 E:0.085581 |  We don't pick up second balls the dominating midfield which America did and it's always difficult
[1582.26 - 1585.14] P:2031.72 E:0.088875 |  It's basically at the minute I play on the counter attack and I'm not getting any joy
[1585.58 - 1587.26] P:1865.64 E:0.068459 |  England are
[1587.26 - 1589.26] P:1980.51 E:0.077635 |  Atrocious so far
[1589.26 - 1592.02] P:1750.94 E:0.093777 |  Maybe simply they're not remotely as good as we thought they were
[1592.90 - 1597.86] P:1868.02 E:0.083529 |  Algeria corner taken by bell had left footed ensuing good catch by David James
[1598.34 - 1605.02] P:1985.17 E:0.077669 |  Fantastic catch to a Algerian players attacking it kept his eye on it terrific catch and England got a start getting
[1605.02 - 1608.86] P:1932.84 E:0.077545 |  We've got to see lump on bar to get on the ball. There's nobody getting on the ball
[1609.46 - 1611.46] P:2075.73 E:0.074201 |  Here's Johnson to Barry
[1611.62 - 1618.26] P:2080.45 E:0.078103 |  Barry just short of the center circle Terry to his left Barry moves forward finds the captain Gerard
[1618.26 - 1621.22] P:2017.54 E:0.082758 |  Rooney to the right on it goes to the United Striker
[1621.42 - 1626.56] P:1973.52 E:0.073192 |  Rooney with a cross looking for has he who tries to chest it in the direction of lump on got it wrong
[1626.60 - 1628.60] P:1847.93 E:0.068946 |  And it's taken away by Yebda
[1630.44 - 1634.44] P:1909.11 E:0.077960 |  Algeria much the better team at the moment it's fed down the right side towards
[1635.04 - 1639.80] P:1924.98 E:0.068706 |  Cadier with Cole got their first the pass back to James and James
[1640.32 - 1646.96] P:1862.21 E:0.073614 |  Slices the clearance up over the halfway line good header a defensive header to the left-hand side to bell hatch
[1647.48 - 1652.72] P:1981.83 E:0.081654 |  Into the ante the ante fancies running at Johnson's already shown he could beat him easily
[1653.28 - 1654.52] P:1825.92 E:0.044340 |  Johnson
[1654.52 - 1656.80] P:1938.19 E:0.086156 |  Try to track him away from the danger area
[1656.80 - 1663.10] P:1882.71 E:0.080725 |  And there's a back heel from Ziani and I said a play this is a team what's been struggling and how confident are these they are so
[1663.24 - 1667.36] P:1962.84 E:0.086225 |  Compact they've worked hard. They know when you play English English team. You've got a work hard
[1667.36 - 1674.52] P:1907.94 E:0.071240 |  There's no doubt about that, but technically they are far superior. I can't think of an England player. He's playing remotely well at the moment
[1676.36 - 1683.08] P:1793.01 E:0.076351 |  Barry caught a possession there. No infringement even it was lampart actually lampart thought it was it should have been a free kick
[1683.48 - 1687.84] P:1859.18 E:0.067939 |  Against Algeria, but it's not bell. Hi to yeah, yeah the captain
[1688.72 - 1696.44] P:1886.13 E:0.072935 |  Under pressure but flicks it to the halfway line Ziani and Ziani with a crossfield ball accurately hit cut out though by
[1696.64 - 1700.68] P:1900.39 E:0.072693 |  Ashley Cole Cole to let a new pops up on the left side now and is
[1701.32 - 1704.88] P:1916.74 E:0.086986 |  Ineffective so far as he was against the United States hardly in the game
[1704.88 - 1708.52] P:1887.03 E:0.086698 |  Well, we're just trying to get a shape ruin. He's not getting in the game can't get any supply
[1708.56 - 1711.36] P:1881.54 E:0.087896 |  Heskey's just getting out of muscle grays not won anything
[1712.04 - 1716.92] P:1938.39 E:0.089556 |  Barry and lampart I'm touch the ball and they're not picking any second balls at edges chasing green shirts at the minute
[1717.32 - 1721.16] P:1874.93 E:0.078719 |  Free kick taken for England. That's a Barry Barry approaching the penalty
[1721.16 - 1725.58] P:1928.20 E:0.070056 |  Yeah, over hits the cross high and wide and out it goes for a throw in
[1725.84 - 1729.48] P:1821.49 E:0.088861 |  It's awful. Well, you want Gerard loose Allen and he's got that freedom
[1729.48 - 1732.24] P:1932.42 E:0.084288 |  But they just can't get the ball to him and then when he's come inside
[1732.24 - 1737.20] P:1752.15 E:0.088048 |  I'll do you are picking all the balls up and they've got an outlet every time on the right with Kedah and you just get out easy
[1737.20 - 1743.72] P:1866.00 E:0.077384 |  There's no pressure Ziani back to bell Hodge after the throw and it's whacked up field and that Terry allows it to clear his head
[1743.80 - 1749.16] P:1850.03 E:0.075667 |  Through today with James. We thankfully settled on after that flopping punch in the early stages of the game
[1749.16 - 1752.68] P:1901.75 E:0.074973 |  We played nearly 26 minutes here in Cape Town
[1752.72 - 1755.68] P:1888.62 E:0.085273 |  You listen to five live in the BBC England ill
[1756.28 - 1759.32] P:2014.12 E:0.076479 |  Algeria no and trust me. We're not worth no no
[1760.40 - 1763.74] P:1980.09 E:0.070432 |  Barry to runy runies on the halfway line here
[1764.54 - 1767.46] P:1974.98 E:0.082060 |  Gets into Gerard runy gets further forward where he should be
[1767.62 - 1772.58] P:2034.61 E:0.072852 |  Gerard's past to the right to Johnson good control by Johnson edge of the penalty
[1772.58 - 1778.46] P:1931.91 E:0.078965 |  I'm letting casual little flick to new a good avail at all and it's easily cleared by Algeria
[1778.98 - 1784.00] P:1876.86 E:0.065611 |  Ziani back to bell Hodge and bell Hodge just steps away from Lenin
[1784.62 - 1790.66] P:1908.59 E:0.086196 |  Bell Hodge fixing in the danger area. Heskey might be there. So do his Gerard was their trip ball breaks at runy
[1790.66 - 1796.46] P:1955.48 E:0.080774 |  Runy just pushed away by Baguera and it's behind. I told a pretty kick. He's given against runy
[1796.46 - 1800.82] P:1939.80 E:0.087131 |  I'd say what bell Hodge? I've watched him and it's three times. He's passed balls into the box
[1800.94 - 1806.88] P:1924.33 E:0.089095 |  He's not looking obviously for me. He's putting these defenders into so much pressure. He's just got to play and say it off forward
[1807.66 - 1812.98] P:1828.72 E:0.080252 |  The thing is I honestly don't think they're that good. I mean, I really don't make them look good
[1812.98 - 1818.78] P:1841.92 E:0.092446 |  I think they've been good on the eye the movements excellent technically the brilliant
[1821.18 - 1822.86] P:1919.72 E:0.067805 |  Capello's look
[1822.86 - 1829.46] P:1968.02 E:0.073208 |  Shows a thousand stories as Algeria take a free kick putting them in the ball back here is Heskey Heskey
[1830.46 - 1831.46] P:1854.03 E:0.056923 |  Oh
[1831.46 - 1833.46] P:1927.03 E:0.072906 |  I'm all according to the linesman
[1834.42 - 1836.94] P:1889.51 E:0.077269 |  Heskey feels that his shirt was being pulled
[1837.22 - 1841.38] P:1871.36 E:0.082429 |  Capello laughs now you can see though why people are saying play runy up front and
[1841.94 - 1845.98] P:1901.24 E:0.078917 |  Play next to midfield man because we can't get any control of this game
[1847.30 - 1849.18] P:1880.77 E:0.052272 |  It ain't working
[1849.30 - 1851.30] P:1909.98 E:0.054946 |  Capello should know it
[1851.34 - 1855.18] P:1901.39 E:0.071333 |  Yahya takes the free kick drives it towards the far side
[1855.18 - 1860.42] P:1821.99 E:0.076257 |  I could hear keeps it a play close to the corner fly cross on to the penalty area cleared on the half folly
[1860.66 - 1863.46] P:1768.91 E:0.082676 |  By Barry and who's the England player down injured? I wrote
[1864.34 - 1867.70] P:1927.63 E:0.053063 |  No, it's it's not it's very it's Terry
[1867.90 - 1873.22] P:1804.34 E:0.081049 |  Well, I don't see how because the roll ball gets rolled back. He's coming late. I think Bulgaria's trod on him accidentally
[1873.22 - 1875.84] P:1863.09 E:0.064115 |  It didn't look any anything that he meant it
[1876.84 - 1877.44] P:1946.10 E:0.022983 |  I
[1877.44 - 1881.96] P:1860.34 E:0.085104 |  Grunt Taylor is um, oh a bit further away than normal. He's about ten yards away
[1882.12 - 1888.96] P:1825.93 E:0.091200 |  Graham doesn't look any better from your perspective. I'm gonna say Alan it doesn't I have to say I mean press with how Algeria
[1889.04 - 1894.76] P:1841.49 E:0.096659 |  Have played I mean press with how they use their formation, but they actually are out numbering
[1895.24 - 1897.52] P:1832.76 E:0.103526 |  England in all the vital parts of the pitch
[1897.52 - 1903.84] P:1846.65 E:0.100659 |  They're keeping the ball well the one big factor or there's two in England's favor is one Algeria
[1903.84 - 1910.84] P:1801.69 E:0.100360 |  Don't seem to have an end product and the other thing is they will give the ball away now and again in dangerous parts of the field
[1910.84 - 1913.56] P:1814.87 E:0.087046 |  Which can help England but at the present time
[1913.64 - 1919.28] P:1854.58 E:0.097351 |  We've gone a long way through the first half and Algeria have been by far the better side
[1920.48 - 1925.92] P:1859.20 E:0.079586 |  Thanks, Graham Terry seem to get a crack at the head there which he feels the linesman should have spotted
[1926.72 - 1931.36] P:1903.37 E:0.071057 |  He's received treatment. He's back on the pitch and Algeria have the play
[1931.84 - 1933.84] P:1860.16 E:0.061620 |  The ball rather yeah, yeah
[1934.40 - 1939.84] P:1830.09 E:0.070093 |  A buckham to bell had in the near side of the field and in to Lassen on to bell
[1939.84 - 1947.28] P:1903.08 E:0.069654 |  Hodge need football from the North African side and then to Ziani, but Ziani off side and it's a free kick to England
[1947.28 - 1950.84] P:1772.99 E:0.094440 |  Well, Bell Hodge was in a fantastic position here wasn't he just so unlamely in your box
[1950.84 - 1955.52] P:1790.44 E:0.080559 |  He's looking in the box not one player Matt board come out. We wanted to defeat everybody the Ziani
[1955.52 - 1960.88] P:1891.49 E:0.081053 |  They all wanted to feet sometimes if you just get a couple of players gambling in that box and get the ball in
[1961.36 - 1968.92] P:1844.41 E:0.074768 |  Nobody in the box. It's all for them. Do it gets me. It's the lack of momentum and pace in the England display so far
[1968.92 - 1970.92] P:1804.70 E:0.083677 |  You know watching Italy the other night, okay?
[1970.92 - 1978.56] P:1901.09 E:0.069460 |  They only drew the game, but they were quick and they played defeat and England are just not at the game at the moment
[1979.24 - 1985.16] P:1926.35 E:0.075044 |  Despite the fans trying to lift them barring to Gerard and Gerard to runy back to Gerard
[1985.16 - 1990.64] P:1937.53 E:0.089652 |  This is a little bit better jargon forward Gerard should slow straight at the goalkeeper easy save easy save
[1990.64 - 1994.20] P:1971.65 E:0.097002 |  Pitch just in front of me did well low goalkeeper just to keep hold of it
[1994.20 - 2000.80] P:1958.92 E:0.090302 |  We've seen many spill in this tournament so far that desire on it got it in his chest to hands wrap reindeer a little bit better
[2000.80 - 2004.40] P:1947.20 E:0.087390 |  That's Gerard linking up with runy but wiring is so slow
[2005.00 - 2010.46] P:1842.09 E:0.068908 |  You know, they can't point to heat the temperatures absolutely perfect tonight in gate time
[2011.28 - 2017.84] P:1832.74 E:0.076849 |  Heskey plays the ball to lampart and lampart and Johnson Johnson with a bit of room down the right side early cross
[2017.88 - 2021.82] P:1817.94 E:0.080916 |  Hydro Hotsheski good header away by Baguera and I started play for an Indian throw
[2022.12 - 2028.04] P:1906.84 E:0.087948 |  Coach has got a big back three there hasn't he the three boys at the back up big and it's gonna have to be a very good delivery for some
[2028.04 - 2034.40] P:1949.89 E:0.083937 |  Even in England to get ahead on it again clears actually cold with a throw into Barry in night to runy 30 awesome
[2034.40 - 2037.96] P:1902.17 E:0.084379 |  Gold runy boots one defender plays in the lamp bar back towards runy
[2038.36 - 2042.80] P:1818.27 E:0.071530 |  Too long and it's behind for a goalkeeper. I think front lamp on wanted it on his right foot there
[2042.80 - 2045.40] P:1968.49 E:0.094021 |  Didn't he just scooped it with his left foot soon as it hits the surface
[2045.44 - 2051.42] P:1906.94 E:0.081237 |  So we've seen it every game the ball skids away and that's why the teams are thinking we passed the feet of other success
[2052.12 - 2055.76] P:1840.57 E:0.080122 |  But I'm just look around the white shirts and I'm thinking are you playing well?
[2056.20 - 2058.52] P:1768.41 E:0.066576 |  Not one of them not one
[2059.00 - 2061.56] P:1876.54 E:0.080001 |  It's a really poor display by England
[2062.40 - 2067.68] P:1773.22 E:0.074094 |  There's a file by Cadier on Terry free kick taken runy
[2068.40 - 2071.72] P:1864.41 E:0.077366 |  Couldn't keep possession runies not just not involved in the game
[2071.72 - 2075.74] P:1887.74 E:0.082599 |  That's a good ball to the left side towards Bellard. Bellard just quick enough to get there
[2076.64 - 2079.72] P:1852.97 E:0.083296 |  Closer the corner flag turns one way then the other beats
[2080.00 - 2084.40] P:1879.08 E:0.082771 |  Letting easily and then the cross bounces in front of James who catches well Bellard
[2084.40 - 2086.64] P:1949.44 E:0.089938 |  He's unfortunately was a slight deflection on the cross for him
[2086.64 - 2091.70] P:1852.07 E:0.088064 |  But he's one of the two boys who are in the box who've made the ground up to gambling company a post the very static
[2091.70 - 2094.52] P:1927.93 E:0.083613 |  I'll hear when they get in the box no movement. Here's the Annie
[2094.92 - 2100.48] P:1889.99 E:0.078605 |  As the Annie cutting in feel away from Johnson, but Heskey was tracking back. Well done. They mill Heskey
[2100.96 - 2106.32] P:1916.60 E:0.075503 |  Johnson was far too easily beaten defensively and now it is Johnson who plays it back to James
[2106.92 - 2113.52] P:1873.75 E:0.071888 |  James plays it upfield 31 and a half minutes gone here in Cape Town beautiful green point stadium, but a
[2114.00 - 2117.08] P:1880.19 E:0.088471 |  Very ugly England display so far, but here's runy
[2117.68 - 2119.92] P:1978.36 E:0.081072 |  No, no in Cape Town runy slips
[2120.96 - 2127.00] P:1796.89 E:0.072099 |  You know something it's nothing against the United States not Wembley. This is it. No, no, it's not nothing wrong with it
[2127.00 - 2129.00] P:1936.60 E:0.086890 |  Green does well with the ball back
[2129.08 - 2132.92] P:1871.09 E:0.071243 |  Plays it to Barry and now lamp are Jeremy's in a good position
[2133.52 - 2140.20] P:1930.71 E:0.081230 |  Jared takes a possession and on it goes to Lenin. What a bit of decent cross our Lenin Lenin from the right whips it in towards the
[2140.20 - 2140.88] P:1957.08 E:0.080034 |  Nürburgring
[2140.88 - 2143.56] P:2000.49 E:0.092229 |  Head of John just for lamp art lamp are short saved
[2144.36 - 2149.52] P:1964.95 E:0.100293 |  Well, it was a good effort lamp on we see through a week in week out in a Chelsea shirt gets in the box very very well
[2149.64 - 2151.64] P:1972.51 E:0.089837 |  And he's just snatched on it with his left foot
[2151.76 - 2155.08] P:2031.39 E:0.094513 |  But give this goalkeeper credit who stepped into night they held it again
[2155.36 - 2159.00] P:1982.46 E:0.096155 |  But that's where the difference between the two sides are when England do get upfield
[2159.00 - 2162.36] P:2024.46 E:0.093497 |  They do have a lot of weight shirts in the box where we've seen Algeria
[2162.36 - 2165.08] P:1894.22 E:0.095341 |  They don't want to put people in the box and that's why they're not going to score goals
[2166.40 - 2171.08] P:1897.16 E:0.092807 |  Remember earlier in the same group it finished Slovenia to the United States to
[2171.76 - 2177.40] P:1898.72 E:0.081803 |  Slovenia top the group at the moment with four points the US of two England will have won Algeria
[2177.84 - 2179.16] P:1913.13 E:0.036595 |  no
[2179.16 - 2183.64] P:1916.55 E:0.070951 |  But you don't need for goodness sake surely we can beat Algeria
[2185.48 - 2192.24] P:1937.50 E:0.074279 |  You know all the hype about what England we're gonna do in this tournament and so far it's been a shambles I
[2193.16 - 2199.84] P:1850.83 E:0.078491 |  Should remind you that in 1990 as you know well Chris England didn't win either of their opening two games
[2199.84 - 2201.84] P:1800.29 E:0.063433 |  And of course went on to the semi-final
[2201.88 - 2207.68] P:1821.24 E:0.076205 |  That's a very powerful back pass by Barry good control by James. I was more like a shot by Gareth Barry
[2208.20 - 2210.20] P:1926.40 E:0.067844 |  James hits the clearance upfield
[2210.40 - 2216.08] P:1910.88 E:0.077327 |  Heskey heads it toward Gerard, but Heskey a judge to have filed the Algerian. That's a free kick
[2216.60 - 2218.60] P:1785.41 E:0.064170 |  To the North African side
[2218.68 - 2221.48] P:1780.13 E:0.082200 |  Much the better team they are they are as I said
[2221.84 - 2226.04] P:1897.27 E:0.080878 |  They just got nothing in the final third or getting players in the box of quality
[2226.56 - 2229.20] P:1869.60 E:0.086535 |  Anything up to there. You've got to say a dominated this game
[2230.56 - 2236.68] P:1862.66 E:0.070534 |  Halleesh takes the free kick and it's now with Lassen on to Bell hatch Lassen once more
[2237.16 - 2239.16] P:1959.41 E:0.053709 |  Back to Halleesh
[2239.16 - 2244.92] P:1765.15 E:0.079670 |  And plenty of time to clear the ball left footed upfield towards Matt Moore Matt Moore with a header in field
[2245.32 - 2253.00] P:1874.62 E:0.075192 |  Terry reacts plays it back to Carragher back at goes to James. That didn't look convincing defending by England James clearance
[2253.20 - 2258.68] P:1933.70 E:0.071245 |  Heskey chess it but only to Carter on the far side of the bill brother was but it goes
[2259.20 - 2265.28] P:1907.44 E:0.070537 |  But it was again running away from Gerard and then Barry gets in a challenge. Gerard takes it up for England
[2266.16 - 2273.60] P:1869.23 E:0.068612 |  Really poor so far from Capello's team Lenin on the half way line back to Johnson and and now Barry again
[2273.92 - 2280.04] P:1907.52 E:0.079127 |  We thought the return of Barry would be influential releasing Gerard and lamp bar to more attacking roles
[2280.80 - 2288.24] P:1953.08 E:0.070448 |  Not so far. It has a Lenin to Gerard and now Barry Barry falls over and there wasn't a file
[2288.88 - 2290.64] P:1965.25 E:0.070074 |  Referee's quite right
[2290.64 - 2294.96] P:1834.30 E:0.076129 |  Barry I think made of a problem now, but England have a problem defensively
[2295.12 - 2299.52] P:1848.86 E:0.087300 |  Ziani breaking forward up to the edge of the England penalty on those right foot shoots wide
[2300.68 - 2304.12] P:1908.97 E:0.092157 |  Barry okay, Barry's limping a little bit. We've got to watch that ankle
[2304.12 - 2307.84] P:1956.46 E:0.090474 |  But again caught in possession not enough movements very sluggish
[2308.12 - 2313.52] P:1798.03 E:0.081059 |  And they break quick the on is being a handful for Glenn Johnson comes inside ideally
[2313.52 - 2317.88] P:1938.43 E:0.079687 |  He's got to hit at the other corner. He's gone near post never going to be David James there
[2319.12 - 2326.48] P:1908.52 E:0.083231 |  Is there a redeeming feature of the England display so far? No, I've struggled. What is it now 35 minutes gone and
[2327.44 - 2330.72] P:1798.87 E:0.086168 |  One shot from lampart really of any worthwhile effort
[2331.44 - 2333.92] P:1773.99 E:0.099545 |  Yet you're gonna say well David James hasn't really been trouble
[2333.92 - 2339.84] P:1871.34 E:0.076220 |  But just in possession in the way they've played I'll do you have just controlled the game remember the lines
[2339.84 - 2345.92] P:1958.85 E:0.080531 |  I'll be opening about 20 minutes time for 606 which I'll present here from Cape Town 0 500 9 0 9
[2346.40 - 2348.40] P:2055.48 E:0.048102 |  6 9 3
[2348.48 - 2352.80] P:2000.20 E:0.081430 |  At the moment I promise it to be an absolutely miserable experience presenting that program
[2353.36 - 2355.12] P:1957.65 E:0.072845 |  England are awful
[2355.12 - 2360.64] P:1852.99 E:0.078159 |  Typified by that pass by Barry and our Prince's Harry and William don't look happy either
[2362.64 - 2364.64] P:1838.98 E:0.094109 |  Nobody come to watch this little dribble
[2366.88 - 2373.52] P:1853.90 E:0.080094 |  All cleared to the far side for Algea great control by Carter Carter on the halfway line left for Yevda
[2374.16 - 2378.96] P:1770.39 E:0.076541 |  Yevda right of the center circle map move with a movement upfield Cadillac has it now
[2379.52 - 2385.68] P:1839.06 E:0.078822 |  Why to Buddha boo Buddha booze and it's how to play off actually call for a throw into Algeria
[2387.20 - 2389.52] P:1968.56 E:0.082117 |  Clueless we look absolutely clueless
[2390.96 - 2392.48] P:1839.23 E:0.058940 |  shapeless
[2392.48 - 2397.04] P:1946.46 E:0.082658 |  Here's Rooney winning the ball slipping again get popper studs way
[2398.00 - 2398.96] P:2053.94 E:0.057267 |  Rooney
[2399.04 - 2405.36] P:1931.73 E:0.084588 |  In now to lampard lampard on towards Lenin the past was overhead half cleared picked up by Heskey couldn't control it
[2405.44 - 2410.48] P:1921.48 E:0.096455 |  And I started playing for throw in England Bellard has been caught out there with a slowly back pass or sloppy pass or
[2410.48 - 2414.08] P:1969.05 E:0.087892 |  China played little passes it seems and that's three teams now
[2415.68 - 2420.40] P:1797.81 E:0.092856 |  Glenn Johnson to take the throw in for England up over the edge of the Algeria penalty area
[2421.04 - 2426.80] P:1859.67 E:0.082569 |  To Lenin back to Johnson Johnson crosses into the penalty area half cleared Jared on the volley right foot
[2427.36 - 2429.36] P:1949.96 E:0.083346 |  So high it almost took the clouds
[2430.56 - 2434.56] P:1886.58 E:0.096148 |  Well, it's just not happened. I was 36 the good thing for him. It is they're not a goal behind
[2435.04 - 2442.56] P:1769.05 E:0.077656 |  They haven't they haven't deserved anything. Rightly so what you're saying, but they're not a goal down and hopefully
[2442.96 - 2447.36] P:1813.27 E:0.079945 |  He can sort it out as off-time because as you say it's a poor performance. Can I pose a question?
[2448.24 - 2453.20] P:1840.88 E:0.078169 |  Um from my opening team sheet for the u.s. Game. I had dual call in the England team
[2453.76 - 2455.84] P:1907.72 E:0.084788 |  How can dual call lock it into this team?
[2456.56 - 2460.32] P:1847.03 E:0.080141 |  What has Lenin done at the moment to justify starting either game?
[2461.68 - 2463.44] P:1900.50 E:0.065242 |  Here's Karagap
[2463.44 - 2465.44] P:1839.73 E:0.069281 |  deputizing for ledley king

[2467.52 - 2471.28] P:1838.06 E:0.085893 |  And he plays it back 20 yards to Terry and all the way back it goes to James
[2472.56 - 2480.08] P:1890.85 E:0.081264 |  James now with his right foot dispatches the ball high towards Heskey who jumps well chests it down controls it finds lampard
[2480.40 - 2484.32] P:1801.69 E:0.084433 |  Lampard to Barry good run by Ashley cold on the left Barry ignores it
[2484.80 - 2488.96] P:1841.46 E:0.078669 |  Plays it back to Terry onto Barry Ashley calls the water. Why did I bother?
[2489.36 - 2495.12] P:1930.51 E:0.071173 |  Here's lampard lampart to the right side and Lenin controlling it decent cross iron
[2495.36 - 2502.40] P:1957.78 E:0.077957 |  Lenin though rushes forward moves in field plays it back Barry shapers of the shoot changing my nice shoot straight at the goalkeeper
[2503.04 - 2504.88] P:1973.41 E:0.076433 |  Well, very predictable
[2504.88 - 2508.00] P:1991.80 E:0.094844 |  Insta kept the ball a little bit better with shown Lenin inside
[2508.48 - 2512.32] P:1918.06 E:0.095443 |  That's where you won't Lenin really for me when he's coming with that pace just to look to try and dink it in
[2512.32 - 2514.80] P:1943.85 E:0.082797 |  Heskey for a one two he's played it to Barry
[2515.60 - 2522.88] P:1880.80 E:0.084281 |  Not a clean strike and an easy save again for the goalkeeper seven minutes to half time at five live England nil Algeria nil
[2524.24 - 2525.36] P:1796.18 E:0.048168 |  Terry
[2525.36 - 2530.88] P:1926.41 E:0.079501 |  forward to Gerard and Gerard with a good pass to Rooney Rooney not rushing forward
[2531.12 - 2537.68] P:1919.62 E:0.084905 |  But beyond the defender a good challenge came in but it's behind for corners and no the referee's giving a free kick against Rooney
[2537.92 - 2541.44] P:1941.98 E:0.092532 |  I tell you what could the other thing terrific place back there didn't he the young boy
[2542.00 - 2545.20] P:1973.80 E:0.095597 |  What a great change of pace because there Rooney is very quick
[2546.64 - 2548.40] P:1857.63 E:0.052517 |  But he's not in the game
[2548.40 - 2552.00] P:1765.30 E:0.096743 |  I always find it hard to get space and when he's got it he doesn't seem to have anybody to play with
[2552.00 - 2554.32] P:1868.24 E:0.082482 |  He just seems to be running down cul-de-sacs at the minute
[2555.28 - 2560.48] P:1929.30 E:0.074732 |  And boy the goalkeeper takes the goal kick and Terry completely misjudged
[2561.36 - 2568.64] P:1809.11 E:0.070400 |  The jump for the header was looking to get away with it. Here's Ashley Cole Terry again onto Gerard down the left into Terry
[2569.20 - 2572.32] P:1825.41 E:0.086062 |  Terry's passed to Rooney on the halfway line immediately
[2572.56 - 2579.92] P:1912.92 E:0.080694 |  But Garag gets in close but Rooney does well flicking it to the right side and here's Glenn Johnson plenty of room to move forward for England
[2581.36 - 2585.92] P:1966.90 E:0.076131 |  He plays it to Heskey Heskey further upfield Heskey's crossed into the penalty here
[2586.88 - 2589.28] P:1912.88 E:0.082442 |  challenged by the defender puts it behind
[2589.92 - 2593.92] P:1820.16 E:0.090173 |  Off a leash for a corner. Yep good defender. No it's a throw in. No throwing sorry
[2595.04 - 2597.04] P:1954.20 E:0.056895 |  With Johnson takes
[2597.04 - 2601.28] P:1829.64 E:0.079019 |  To Lampard back to Johnson and another throw in is the result to England
[2603.60 - 2606.08] P:1788.55 E:0.085958 |  No threat being carried at all by those in white
[2607.20 - 2610.32] P:1890.74 E:0.084359 |  So far it can only improve surely here's Barry
[2610.96 - 2612.32] P:1949.46 E:0.072420 |  Gerard available
[2612.32 - 2618.48] P:1879.70 E:0.081479 |  It's back to Gerard on now to Lampard Gerard keeps running forward. It goes to Lenin and Lenin never looked
[2619.28 - 2621.28] P:2005.59 E:0.072929 |  Gives the ball away shocking
[2622.00 - 2623.52] P:1891.64 E:0.067930 |  Far side of the field
[2623.52 - 2625.04] P:1745.33 E:0.042877 |  Kadeir
[2625.04 - 2627.76] P:1853.63 E:0.083600 |  I don't want to pick on just one player because they're all bad
[2628.24 - 2632.32] P:1800.82 E:0.073514 |  But I can't see any contribution that are in Lenin's making in the moment
[2633.36 - 2637.84] P:1870.77 E:0.059447 |  Here's Yebda back to Begir and into Halleesh
[2638.56 - 2641.28] P:1871.65 E:0.086432 |  They look so comfortable. Well, maybe they don't work on a system
[2641.28 - 2643.44] P:1764.03 E:0.095424 |  You know, we don't see the team till two hours before kickoff
[2643.44 - 2647.52] P:1724.95 E:0.091440 |  So maybe they don't work on a system. They just put the team and say this is how we're going to play in a bit of paper
[2647.92 - 2652.64] P:1808.95 E:0.084860 |  And the difference after Alger just look at saying they all know what they're doing the movements excellent
[2653.36 - 2658.48] P:1817.34 E:0.081025 |  They've got when they give the ball to someone they know something's going to happen the next player moves. We're England. They're all static
[2659.20 - 2663.44] P:1826.59 E:0.071405 |  Is he any can't find Matt Moore. It's had a play for a throw in. It's not a great game actually, is it?
[2663.92 - 2664.88] P:1849.75 E:0.053240 |  Super
[2664.88 - 2668.24] P:1809.92 E:0.055029 |  Have you seen the Deeks match yet Chris the World Cup? No
[2669.44 - 2671.44] P:1921.69 E:0.048663 |  Same with me
[2671.52 - 2673.52] P:1890.92 E:0.070285 |  I'm particularly not watching England
[2673.76 - 2677.20] P:1916.77 E:0.068204 |  Barry to Gerard Gerard gets it to Lampard
[2677.60 - 2681.84] P:1915.94 E:0.084229 |  Why to Johnson for most a halftime at five line England ill Algeria ill
[2682.56 - 2684.56] P:1907.52 E:0.062371 |  Johnson back to Carragher
[2684.88 - 2688.56] P:1967.92 E:0.081079 |  And on to Terry in the far side of the field. It's so slow
[2689.76 - 2690.80] P:1903.57 E:0.038823 |  Barry
[2690.80 - 2696.88] P:1895.86 E:0.072082 |  To Lampard just over the halfway line back to Carragher and to Terry again. Did we start there a minute ago?
[2697.76 - 2699.76] P:1907.16 E:0.078056 |  Have we moved forward properly?
[2700.16 - 2702.16] P:1985.04 E:0.049380 |  nice with Rooney
[2702.48 - 2703.84] P:1972.10 E:0.038694 |  to Terry
[2703.84 - 2705.20] P:1903.75 E:0.048153 |  to Lampard
[2706.16 - 2708.16] P:1879.54 E:0.071085 |  20 yards over the halfway line
[2708.40 - 2712.00] P:1955.44 E:0.079185 |  John Terry is now up alongside him to the left on to Ashley Cole
[2712.40 - 2718.56] P:1879.45 E:0.073109 |  A one-two attempted there didn't come off Terry's pass wasn't good and Perker just shepherds the ball behind for a goal kick
[2719.04 - 2722.16] P:1746.04 E:0.087303 |  That's very slow and run out of ideas not enough movement
[2722.56 - 2726.00] P:1763.32 E:0.088179 |  And something I like I'd like to see me keep the ball a bit more and move it
[2726.08 - 2728.72] P:1804.90 E:0.084715 |  But then they've got to move it a little bit quicker and what they are there
[2729.12 - 2734.32] P:1827.73 E:0.086963 |  You know, why why'd you play two? Well, well definitely one way man if you can't get you've got to switch the ball early to wait man
[2734.48 - 2742.80] P:1852.79 E:0.066879 |  There is nothing good that can be said about this England display so far three minutes left until the interval here in Cape Town
[2743.76 - 2749.76] P:1831.22 E:0.080317 |  Beautiful Cape Town today glorious weather totally against the forecast that we were led to believe would be pertinent
[2751.12 - 2754.24] P:1790.84 E:0.077363 |  Here's that Carragher with a pass back to David James
[2754.88 - 2756.88] P:1806.10 E:0.090495 |  James controls the ball all in yellow
[2757.92 - 2759.92] P:1901.99 E:0.067284 |  Then it's on to John Terry
[2760.08 - 2765.28] P:1880.34 E:0.073949 |  Ashley Cole to his left in field it's Gerard inside the center circle to Terry
[2766.24 - 2767.60] P:1871.91 E:0.076878 |  Gerard again
[2767.60 - 2774.32] P:1875.21 E:0.079734 |  Still inside the England half better ball forward to Rooney Rooney almost missed control of it did well finds glenn johnson running forward
[2774.48 - 2780.40] P:2024.83 E:0.082195 |  Johnson moving in field without great conviction but gets it back to Rooney Rooney should have 30 yards easily saved
[2780.80 - 2784.64] P:1868.24 E:0.095233 |  So what the goalie's doing well. I know they look easy these boards are pitching them just in front of them and
[2785.20 - 2788.24] P:1881.48 E:0.091685 |  Everyone he's kept a hold off very very well and I like to say it
[2788.24 - 2791.68] P:1795.42 E:0.078608 |  He's setting example to Robert Green, you know get your body behind the ball
[2792.64 - 2794.64] P:1873.23 E:0.058942 |  And he's only a kid
[2795.04 - 2797.28] P:1756.34 E:0.073329 |  He's yabba over the halfway line
[2797.84 - 2799.12] P:1972.29 E:0.055993 |  And that's a
[2799.12 - 2804.08] P:1922.01 E:0.072924 |  A ball to a faster player in an obvious offside position free kick England
[2804.96 - 2808.00] P:1723.23 E:0.066637 |  Gerard to Barry Barry back to Carragher
[2808.96 - 2812.40] P:1881.16 E:0.080298 |  Two minutes of this torture to endure before we have the halftime interval
[2812.96 - 2816.40] P:1794.41 E:0.066232 |  When one would hope that Capello could change things
[2817.36 - 2819.36] P:1883.95 E:0.064984 |  James clatters it up here
[2819.36 - 2823.92] P:2010.63 E:0.072153 |  Heskey jumps loses at it where the ball is now he sees it brings it under control
[2824.32 - 2827.60] P:1783.63 E:0.067868 |  Near the right touch line and then he's tackled it's out for an England throw in
[2829.36 - 2832.00] P:1943.45 E:0.067597 |  Pedestrian England boring England
[2833.60 - 2836.48] P:1906.37 E:0.075829 |  Charlotte Beckham might have noted off there in the touch line
[2837.36 - 2842.32] P:1858.62 E:0.079329 |  Barry runs forward loses it cleared over the halfway line by Algeria and it is
[2843.28 - 2845.28] P:1833.79 E:0.076872 |  I think it's the worst game I've seen in the World Cup
[2845.84 - 2847.84] P:1938.81 E:0.030178 |  Shocking
[2848.08 - 2850.88] P:1944.43 E:0.082502 |  Worse even than Ivory Coast in Portugal, which is saying something
[2853.12 - 2857.76] P:1859.27 E:0.080370 |  England and no rush to take this throw in we're inside the final minute of the first half
[2859.44 - 2861.44] P:1830.35 E:0.062557 |  You know Capello picked the team
[2861.68 - 2863.68] P:1823.01 E:0.048567 |  He picks the tactics
[2863.76 - 2869.52] P:1843.29 E:0.076673 |  Presumably they've been practicing the tactics, but you don't know if they don't know the team until two hours before kickoff
[2870.32 - 2875.20] P:1863.56 E:0.081065 |  Heskey with the header to Lenin then over the back heel again far too casual straight to Halish
[2875.76 - 2879.36] P:1792.39 E:0.078076 |  All night to Matmore and Matmore plays it to the right side
[2879.92 - 2886.16] P:1865.18 E:0.067982 |  Here's Cadir Cadir on towards Matmore good challenge by Carragher and it's out of playing the far side of the field for throwing
[2886.64 - 2890.40] P:1822.47 E:0.086963 |  Well, I gotta say the Algerian coach will be delayed the way they've looked after the ball
[2890.48 - 2893.76] P:1796.03 E:0.068611 |  Obviously no cutting edge in the final third. That's good news for England, but um
[2894.40 - 2897.12] P:1788.71 E:0.076838 |  England Capello, where does he start? Where does he start?
[2898.08 - 2903.76] P:1866.65 E:0.077224 |  Well, it'd be nice to see the old player playing well lampard intercepts an attempt to clearance runy
[2904.96 - 2906.96] P:2098.51 E:0.100075 |  Just easily challenged and loses the ball
[2907.60 - 2909.60] P:1910.12 E:0.077703 |  Where's the world class Wayne runy?
[2910.40 - 2912.40] P:1813.25 E:0.090736 |  Haven't seen it so far here in South Africa
[2912.96 - 2918.40] P:1910.82 E:0.078597 |  Terry stretches finds Cole Cole almost puts Barry under pressure in fact. He did put Barry under pressure
[2918.64 - 2924.08] P:1870.48 E:0.070161 |  Algeria had the ball back bell hatch midway inside being on half turning back
[2925.04 - 2932.08] P:1835.80 E:0.072584 |  Dinked it into Yevda. Yevda attempting to play a one two. It's now with Ziani who has moved from left to right
[2932.48 - 2937.60] P:1877.89 E:0.077451 |  He plays the ball back into his own half. We're into time added on for stoppages. I didn't see it for the official
[2938.08 - 2940.72] P:1884.93 E:0.081813 |  One minute has been added on of this torture
[2941.68 - 2943.68] P:1922.94 E:0.068498 |  And it's not too strong a word
[2943.92 - 2946.72] P:1888.63 E:0.073902 |  particularly from an England perspective. They've been awful
[2947.92 - 2952.80] P:1973.01 E:0.071810 |  Ball might break to runy. Runy doesn't rush to get it. He looks disinterested their way in runy
[2953.36 - 2957.12] P:1846.01 E:0.082800 |  Now bell hatch rushes forward down the left side. He's going to run down to play doors
[2957.76 - 2961.68] P:1860.34 E:0.070757 |  The line lines went surely single. Yes, it's a throw into England. Well
[2963.36 - 2967.04] P:1788.68 E:0.085831 |  I just think the big problem we've got is we don't pick up second boards. We don't keep the ball
[2967.12 - 2971.04] P:1815.15 E:0.076643 |  We don't play quick enough. We don't know what's all the help but the two boys in midfield
[2971.84 - 2975.04] P:1789.21 E:0.082750 |  They don't move the ball quick enough. They don't look forward. They don't look weighed
[2975.36 - 2979.52] P:1804.79 E:0.083391 |  It sort of comes into them in the one it they get it and then haven't got a picture in their eyes
[2979.76 - 2983.20] P:1729.29 E:0.089487 |  And they turn back and go back to Carragher in John Terry. What are you going to do with it?
[2983.68 - 2987.76] P:1942.49 E:0.073543 |  It's in complete contrast to the way Italy ushered the ball around quickly
[2988.72 - 2990.72] P:1911.10 E:0.069363 |  And there's the halftime whistle
[2991.28 - 2996.80] P:1982.23 E:0.087983 |  Shocking absolutely shopping Chris. Well, he's got to change it. I don't think the crowd's too up yet and
[2997.60 - 3002.24] P:1955.22 E:0.093785 |  I don't know how he's going to change it. Yes, you can look at Joe Colley. You look whoever you like at the minute
[3002.64 - 3009.04] P:1909.87 E:0.086485 |  It's about tempo and looking forward having a picture when it comes to you two boys in midfield have slowed it down too much
[3009.44 - 3012.24] P:1973.39 E:0.087798 |  Never looked forward at all. Gerald is wandering around now
[3012.72 - 3016.64] P:1930.63 E:0.087674 |  And uh, you've got to say I'll give you have had the best shape and technically they've been the best team
[3018.24 - 3020.24] P:1664.42 E:0.084855 |  What can you say? No, no
[3020.24 - 3024.48] P:1804.25 E:0.093250 |  Well, I thought the moment in the first half which summed up England mark tonight
[3024.96 - 3026.96] P:1731.61 E:0.083972 |  Was the chance that fell to frank lampard
[3027.36 - 3029.36] P:1769.57 E:0.095895 |  He's facing to be grip with tension
[3029.68 - 3033.76] P:1866.75 E:0.090545 |  And he scuffed it without any conviction had he been playing in the blue of chelsea
[3033.92 - 3036.16] P:1936.59 E:0.086974 |  He would have closed his eyes and swept it home
[3037.12 - 3040.40] P:1976.44 E:0.103595 |  That's what england are searching for here
[3040.96 - 3042.96] P:1968.54 E:0.097050 |  Club form at international level
[3043.04 - 3050.00] P:1914.63 E:0.101714 |  As the sides take the field for the second half egypt mexico japan even platinum stars usa and now algeria
[3050.32 - 3053.92] P:1985.57 E:0.096161 |  All the games of this year so far a non-performance in the first half
[3054.32 - 3055.92] P:1858.40 E:0.076727 |  Fabio Cappello
[3055.92 - 3060.96] P:1897.46 E:0.090027 |  The most highly paid international manager around the world has to come up with some answers here
[3061.20 - 3063.20] P:1848.56 E:0.077834 |  He's going to start the way that he
[3063.20 - 3065.20] P:1984.67 E:0.091458 |  Began the game with this england lineup
[3065.44 - 3070.80] P:1863.37 E:0.092376 |  James johnson karigatarian dashley coal lampard barry lenin runey gerrod and heskey
[3071.04 - 3073.20] P:1893.21 E:0.086079 |  Lenin won't be given a long adept thinking this second half
[3073.84 - 3076.56] P:1881.82 E:0.080727 |  And uh, that's the england lineup the england team
[3077.12 - 3080.32] P:1966.88 E:0.087261 |  Completely unable to come to terms with a an algurian system
[3080.40 - 3084.16] P:1940.76 E:0.085651 |  Which is sort of three four two one which has caused all sorts of problems
[3084.64 - 3089.84] P:1953.55 E:0.084906 |  And the algurian lineup of boy burgira haleesh yahir second half just begins
[3090.40 - 3094.72] P:1900.26 E:0.080271 |  Kadea yabda bel haj budaboo's lassan ziani mattmore
[3095.36 - 3098.64] P:1953.71 E:0.092663 |  The speckastan referee had a very easy first half really
[3099.60 - 3100.80] P:2081.17 E:0.063242 |  No
[3100.80 - 3105.76] P:2002.63 E:0.091043 |  Moments to clear up in england now. How will they react the crowd are trying to respond immediately?
[3106.72 - 3111.44] P:1940.23 E:0.081617 |  Is terry finds lampard england in the second half play from right to left the first half
[3112.16 - 3114.48] P:2097.42 E:0.093975 |  Much worse than the performers against the usa
[3114.96 - 3118.64] P:1984.38 E:0.091610 |  Johnson's ball in that england now looked to runey. What's more runey though?
[3118.96 - 3122.16] P:2008.24 E:0.071142 |  Who's his touches lacking him down here england need just
[3123.04 - 3126.96] P:1942.88 E:0.085039 |  To get forward and build up some momentum here need a bit more urgency
[3127.44 - 3130.40] P:1957.18 E:0.086934 |  Need to hunt the ball back quicker need to hold on to it when they get it
[3130.72 - 3137.04] P:2004.25 E:0.084195 |  And now it's kadea all in green down the algurian right near side into yabda yabda is not venturing very far forward
[3137.04 - 3139.04] P:2055.83 E:0.082394 |  He's just anchoring in the center there of midfield
[3139.28 - 3145.44] P:1931.71 E:0.086990 |  Algiria at least haven't got a striker to troubling them so far as lampard tries to get the ball through to wane runey
[3145.52 - 3151.28] P:1985.97 E:0.077817 |  It's gone down under the challenge runey looked to the referee perhaps for a free kick and algiria play on chris waddle for the first time
[3151.60 - 3155.92] P:1899.05 E:0.090341 |  In this second half. I haven't really started any tempo different from what they did in the first half same shape
[3156.24 - 3158.24] P:1705.70 E:0.076176 |  And luckily enough as I said for them
[3158.96 - 3163.28] P:1957.91 E:0.092737 |  They'll give a free kick yeah, we're both 30 yards out. I'm sure somewhere you'll strike this ziani
[3163.84 - 3166.72] P:1984.57 E:0.070234 |  Well, if england don't win this game tonight
[3167.68 - 3169.68] P:1895.36 E:0.088309 |  If they think there's pressure out there this evening
[3170.24 - 3174.96] P:1847.49 E:0.070180 |  Then that's nothing compared to what they'll have in port elizabeth against slaviniya next wednesday
[3175.92 - 3177.92] P:1850.68 E:0.090439 |  And here's a big moment perhaps for algiria
[3178.80 - 3181.44] P:1868.56 E:0.084343 |  Having been happy to contain for the most part
[3182.56 - 3190.08] P:1854.60 E:0.082343 |  Bugeira particularly can thump the dead balls. He's just not too far away from this ziani is often involved in the set pieces
[3190.32 - 3195.28] P:1845.78 E:0.074467 |  England lining up and now here's a big testing moment for david james
[3196.08 - 3201.04] P:1882.75 E:0.088941 |  His algiria free kick is a long long way away from the england goal
[3202.24 - 3204.40] P:1937.96 E:0.090619 |  david james stands on his line
[3205.44 - 3211.12] P:2005.91 E:0.083614 |  The free kick to be smashed in for algiria straight into the england war and the ball breaks to the far side of the field
[3211.12 - 3215.04] P:1944.36 E:0.088424 |  Where johnson can't get there against the arney who turns around him brilliantly
[3215.36 - 3219.76] P:1977.98 E:0.087418 |  Ziani for algiria johnson made a good recovery and now it's lenin lenin will
[3220.40 - 3224.88] P:1959.44 E:0.097667 |  Be given perhaps 10 or 15 minutes to see what he can do down the right hand side. I agree with allen
[3225.28 - 3229.92] P:1946.97 E:0.088220 |  They really need joe cole. I think his enterprise in the second half as algiria tidy up once more
[3230.32 - 3233.68] P:1850.64 E:0.080157 |  And it's a neat header back to the goalkeeper. Oh boy chris. There's ziani
[3234.72 - 3239.76] P:1875.71 E:0.079466 |  Brilliant change of pace and direction and he's got to beat me then johnson every time he picks it up
[3240.40 - 3241.68] P:2093.21 E:0.098733 |  Just a little shake of the hips
[3241.84 - 3247.04] P:1970.46 E:0.082191 |  Does it really is now the ball is launched forward towards matt moore matt moore doesn't control it first time
[3247.04 - 3250.48] P:1977.25 E:0.091412 |  But now he's going to try and turn with the england defenders and here's a crossing opportunity
[3250.72 - 3254.56] P:1961.62 E:0.093339 |  Ball dragged back onto the england area to matt moore surrounded by white shirts
[3254.88 - 3261.28] P:2038.06 E:0.088523 |  Moments here of danger for england and algiria lose their way and england give the ball back once more to david james in the goal
[3261.36 - 3267.44] P:1980.46 E:0.079605 |  Away to our right. This is five live second half three minutes old england nil algiria nil
[3268.24 - 3271.36] P:1981.93 E:0.078504 |  David james getting impatient here before he makes the clearance
[3272.00 - 3276.00] P:1954.39 E:0.076861 |  james brings the ball forward and now aims it towards
[3276.64 - 3282.24] P:2007.45 E:0.089433 |  Heskey and runi in the algiria half heskey header on looking for runi runi now looking to play it into gerard
[3282.24 - 3285.76] P:1968.87 E:0.089808 |  It was very well defended by buggera at the back there for algiria
[3286.08 - 3290.00] P:2003.04 E:0.084915 |  And now they look to get forward once more lovely touches in midfield at times
[3290.24 - 3297.28] P:2016.87 E:0.086335 |  And then buggera has just hammered it down the center towards matt moore and john terry penalize clumsy challenge by the chelsea captain
[3297.84 - 3300.08] P:1995.83 E:0.092891 |  You know algiria were looking forward and they've got another free kick
[3300.16 - 3305.20] P:1934.85 E:0.091928 |  He's a new sense mat boy he doesn't jump he just gets his body on the lane of the ball and john terry's focused on it
[3305.76 - 3307.76] P:1827.70 E:0.088305 |  And that's two in a row. He's just brought them down now
[3309.52 - 3314.80] P:1882.88 E:0.089090 |  Well, it's a very long way out but with this world cup ball anything's possible. Yedda at the moment is placing it
[3315.36 - 3318.56] P:1951.39 E:0.089848 |  And uh, algiria just in conversation around the ball here
[3319.36 - 3322.48] P:1935.47 E:0.078249 |  It's going to be lasso and i think who might take responsibility
[3322.88 - 3324.00] P:1928.86 E:0.044140 |  It's yedda
[3324.00 - 3330.72] P:1920.50 E:0.082709 |  Or maybe yedda yedda at the moment is marching and perhaps he's going to run in and try and smash this one towards david james
[3331.12 - 3338.08] P:1910.63 E:0.078125 |  Lassen standing over the ball. Maybe he will touch this one off 10 yards. No, england with a wall of five referee wants them back another
[3338.48 - 3339.92] P:1914.30 E:0.033253 |  couple of
[3339.92 - 3341.92] P:1937.62 E:0.048962 |  couple of feet
[3341.92 - 3347.28] P:1945.65 E:0.081340 |  So david james crouches away to our right. We'll try and get everything behind this if it comes his way
[3348.16 - 3352.80] P:1978.15 E:0.089744 |  Yedda perhaps of portsmouth is going to hit this towards his own portsmouth goalkeeper david james
[3353.28 - 3354.24] P:1963.85 E:0.078486 |  Here it comes
[3354.24 - 3357.60] P:2124.50 E:0.084672 |  Yedda's drive all along the ground johnson managed to take all the sting out of it
[3358.00 - 3364.32] P:1970.90 E:0.077499 |  And heskey in the right back position now to try and loop that's only aron lenon up front and that was poor play from melmore heskey
[3364.64 - 3369.44] P:2003.93 E:0.079113 |  Straight back again to the algirians and it's yedda. I mean yedda and belhage who
[3370.16 - 3373.44] P:1938.35 E:0.092179 |  Are tonight looking a million dollars out there for algiria against this?
[3374.40 - 3379.60] P:1941.35 E:0.087591 |  Multi million pound england team ball played into the england penalty area it doesn't trouble david james
[3379.60 - 3385.28] P:2038.97 E:0.083075 |  But james is showing loads of signs of frustration down there with his defenders and england need to be together here
[3385.76 - 3389.92] P:1678.70 E:0.079358 |  Well, they just can't get the ball as simple as that mate. They're not moving it. They're not quick enough
[3389.92 - 3394.40] P:1899.45 E:0.081109 |  They can't pick it up. They can't pick second balls up. They're just stretched out where they're very compact
[3394.40 - 3399.04] P:1890.80 E:0.076137 |  Yes, they're just lucky england so far. Let's be honest that algiria haven't got a cutting edge
[3399.20 - 3403.28] P:1868.13 E:0.084843 |  They have not got a center forward chris. What a terrible ball that was there by gareth barry
[3403.76 - 3406.40] P:1872.27 E:0.090863 |  It just nobody just seems to want to hold the ball here
[3406.48 - 3411.20] P:1935.79 E:0.081230 |  They are showing all the fear that fabio capello talked about when he took over
[3411.68 - 3415.52] P:1945.58 E:0.083313 |  Gripped by anxiety michael karik at the moment doing some stretches down there
[3416.00 - 3419.76] P:1867.52 E:0.086367 |  Fabio capello is back in the technical area looking for an improvement here
[3420.08 - 3424.32] P:1900.21 E:0.086336 |  england concede yet another free kick and they haven't been able to build up any kind of
[3424.64 - 3426.64] P:1942.28 E:0.084121 |  Flow at all at the start of the second half
[3427.04 - 3431.44] P:1925.64 E:0.076806 |  It really is a shapeless performance here lacking conviction and confidence
[3432.00 - 3436.16] P:1890.14 E:0.077192 |  But most important of all here just afflicted too much by
[3436.88 - 3438.88] P:1907.22 E:0.070985 |  By the expectation, I think
[3439.12 - 3444.56] P:1915.17 E:0.085503 |  england nil algirian nil on five live and already six minutes gone in the second half as buggera
[3444.96 - 3447.68] P:1929.42 E:0.079254 |  Thumps the free kick into the england half kariga gets above
[3448.56 - 3452.08] P:1962.26 E:0.081991 |  The striker but that little flick there from ziani map more is there
[3452.24 - 3456.64] P:1943.04 E:0.066335 |  The lenons trying to track back and the ball is out of play down the right and it's going to be
[3457.36 - 3461.92] P:1905.27 E:0.079932 |  An england throne, but they just haven't got going again here and capello will have to make changes soon
[3462.96 - 3464.96] P:1944.90 E:0.068102 |  Injection perhaps from the bench
[3465.20 - 3466.24] P:1871.66 E:0.074009 |  milner
[3466.24 - 3467.20] P:1944.73 E:0.070990 |  Cole
[3467.20 - 3470.64] P:1981.69 E:0.076256 |  karik defoe would all love to come on i'm sure to try and
[3471.28 - 3473.28] P:1826.74 E:0.068512 |  lift this england performance
[3473.44 - 3475.12] P:1790.87 E:0.091957 |  Ball still inside the england half
[3475.12 - 3479.28] P:1796.58 E:0.077352 |  It's been pretty much there for the whole of this second half runes hardly had a touch
[3479.76 - 3485.52] P:1905.32 E:0.087062 |  At the start now he might get it now runes flick to jerry jerry's early ball now for heiske down the right hand side
[3485.68 - 3491.36] P:1997.17 E:0.089314 |  Algeria now trying to get players back heiske takes possession down the england right needs some delivery here emil heiske
[3491.44 - 3495.04] P:1948.72 E:0.086830 |  He's stumbling into the penalty area and then nothing cross comes in from heiske
[3496.32 - 3499.52] P:1939.09 E:0.095133 |  And that really was wretched from heiske england broke well
[3500.16 - 3506.32] P:1989.28 E:0.084821 |  Clever ball to emil heiske the ball just seemed to get tangled up under his feet and there was nothing at the end of it
[3506.96 - 3509.04] P:1888.81 E:0.083819 |  Now just some zingland up i'm afraid to say
[3509.92 - 3513.44] P:1887.68 E:0.086946 |  Just nothing's happening. There's no bodies. You say i think probably steven jerrods
[3513.44 - 3517.20] P:1921.77 E:0.085280 |  The only one who's looked like trying to do anything when he's had the ball apart from that
[3518.00 - 3520.00] P:1787.52 E:0.089669 |  Very lackluster performance by everybody
[3520.64 - 3525.68] P:1983.21 E:0.079711 |  Adject performance and you just wonder also whether gareth barry is going to be able to finish the game here having been out since the
[3526.48 - 3528.72] P:1997.88 E:0.095606 |  First week of may back past the goalkeeper and boy
[3529.44 - 3531.68] P:1958.00 E:0.085887 |  This is barry's first game for some weeks
[3532.40 - 3536.24] P:1863.65 E:0.081329 |  And uh, you just wonder whether he'll have the stamina to be able to see it through
[3536.24 - 3541.68] P:1995.13 E:0.082208 |  So that's perhaps why the likes of miller and karakor warming at johnson called in possession over on the far side
[3541.68 - 3545.92] P:1968.98 E:0.076986 |  But the referee is going to penalize the arty and johnson's gone down under the challenge
[3546.48 - 3551.44] P:1858.51 E:0.084690 |  And england have a free kick. I tell you what's noticeable. I make I know that's how we've got the benefit that we play
[3551.52 - 3555.92] P:1848.35 E:0.076340 |  You can't show your studs, you know that but i just i can't believe the difference in technique
[3556.40 - 3560.88] P:1858.22 E:0.082042 |  We've fainted heart a controller ball and pass it and move and our first touches
[3561.12 - 3564.16] P:1839.37 E:0.064436 |  It the difference in its old teams is amazing
[3564.16 - 3569.44] P:1878.29 E:0.087465 |  But most of these algerian players were schooled in france, weren't they at academies around clefontaine
[3570.08 - 3571.52] P:1908.62 E:0.071653 |  Some of them i know
[3571.52 - 3574.72] P:1928.32 E:0.086754 |  Will coach there and they just look so much more comfortable on the ball
[3575.28 - 3580.48] P:2043.67 E:0.080660 |  Free kick to england nil nil heskey now trying to chill the ball on the chest drops it back into midfield to barry
[3580.48 - 3584.08] P:2021.29 E:0.093478 |  There's no shape here though for england. It's gareth barry now getting the ball away
[3584.48 - 3588.72] P:2016.61 E:0.097144 |  Tired pass there by gareth barry and here come out algeria on the break almost
[3589.04 - 3594.88] P:2001.02 E:0.085374 |  Finding map more england just managed to cut the ball out and ashley coal threads it back once more to gulky for david james
[3595.28 - 3600.88] P:2014.68 E:0.085088 |  What a careless bit of football that was from gareth barry now the clearance from james heskey doesn't even make a challenge
[3601.04 - 3606.00] P:1910.80 E:0.072489 |  It's headed back by algeria and they've got a man yards off side and england have a free kick
[3606.08 - 3612.00] P:1874.29 E:0.076040 |  But there's absolutely no tempo at all here from england. It's a free kicked algeria offside
[3612.96 - 3615.92] P:1909.28 E:0.076671 |  And already nearly nine minutes gone in the second half
[3617.20 - 3620.32] P:2003.17 E:0.097525 |  england will be very fortunate if they go on to win this game
[3621.04 - 3625.04] P:1899.65 E:0.076623 |  Free kick to algeria map more can't control it england
[3625.60 - 3628.72] P:1869.55 E:0.094920 |  Getting themselves into difficulty here. Then there's a foul on ashley coal
[3629.44 - 3631.44] P:1993.42 E:0.068921 |  And they have the free kick
[3631.60 - 3639.68] P:2011.67 E:0.080705 |  But they lack belief here something has to happen to change this for england lampard now of england shuffling forward everybody's running away from him
[3640.08 - 3644.56] P:2081.31 E:0.087525 |  Lampard nobody helping him out barry now manages to sidestep lassan in midfield
[3644.96 - 3649.12] P:2019.98 E:0.095111 |  Gerard back to barry nobody wants to hold the ball here lampard appeals for a handball
[3649.12 - 3651.76] P:2093.61 E:0.101344 |  But they lose their way again in midfield to england
[3652.40 - 3659.60] P:1993.06 E:0.097312 |  And then algeria give the ball away carelessly lampard now to steven gerard gerard pulls it back to an algerian defender
[3660.48 - 3664.56] P:1954.68 E:0.104830 |  And hands go on heads all around us here because that was a good opportunity
[3665.04 - 3669.60] P:1990.62 E:0.093793 |  For england i think chris was saying in the first half that that's the one weakness of this algerian team
[3670.00 - 3675.04] P:1950.78 E:0.094868 |  But sometimes they can give the ball away in dangerous areas england have a corner
[3675.36 - 3682.16] P:1973.72 E:0.092978 |  Now can they settle themselves down in this game here the short corner to lenin of england lenin on the edge of the area
[3682.32 - 3687.36] P:2011.47 E:0.086558 |  Whipson a left footer can't get past the first defender who's bel hage bel hage's clearance to matmore
[3687.60 - 3691.68] P:1950.46 E:0.080273 |  Ashley coal stabs it back and it's out of play over on the far side from algeria throw

[3704.32 - 3710.48] P:1878.06 E:0.089445 |  Oh beckham would have given this england team a little bit more accurate service. I think had he been over on that right hand side
[3711.92 - 3717.60] P:1888.97 E:0.089627 |  Here come algeria on the halfway line a looping ball to the sneer side of the field ashley coal rising above kadeir

[3931.12 - 3933.44] P:1839.20 E:0.096428 |  Yeah, he had it at the centre half. I don't know why they're rolling the ball
[3933.44 - 3938.48] P:1982.96 E:0.090934 |  What a position he's got there to run up and bend it or strike it with pace. You don't need to roll it
[3939.36 - 3943.60] P:1981.36 E:0.084009 |  Well, algerius preparation spot on tonight for england. They denied them the possession

[3956.16 - 3958.64] P:1944.77 E:0.095419 |  Extremely fortunate ashley coal with the throw in
[3959.36 - 3965.12] P:1995.83 E:0.084555 |  Heskey and rooney in the area. We're reaching the point now where surely fabio capello will think about changes with

[3967.92 - 3969.92] P:2019.17 E:0.081616 |  england throwing ashley coal
[3970.64 - 3974.96] P:2057.77 E:0.094512 |  Seems to be running out of ideas here throws it on to gerrard's back and england lose it straight away
[3975.28 - 3979.36] P:2026.89 E:0.087897 |  John terry tries to play it back lampard will bring it down and send it forward to rooney
[3979.44 - 3982.48] P:2031.05 E:0.082127 |  And rooney can't control it and lampard didn't want to hold it either
[3982.56 - 3986.80] P:1955.82 E:0.091780 |  But somehow at the end of all of that they get a corner kick out of sure no phillips is going to come on
[3987.52 - 3990.00] P:1960.55 E:0.102279 |  And that'll be got to be for lenin
[3990.72 - 3994.48] P:1995.82 E:0.099598 |  Well, let's be honest hasn't had a great game, but you could take anybody off tonight
[3995.20 - 3997.20] P:2035.15 E:0.082890 |  And so still no joe coal
[3997.44 - 4001.44] P:2027.38 E:0.092307 |  At this world cup for england nil algeria nil on five line
[4002.00 - 4005.20] P:2004.40 E:0.090241 |  Stephen gerrard the england captain with an england corner kick
[4006.32 - 4011.28] P:2031.85 E:0.087527 |  White shirts weight in the area in goes the kick goalkeeper fist it and holds on to it in the end
[4011.36 - 4014.80] P:1978.20 E:0.083516 |  In fact, he didn't fist it he juggled with it and then tumbled over and made the catch
[4015.44 - 4018.88] P:2020.03 E:0.084936 |  And the opportunity goes begging and we're into the last half an hour of this game
[4019.20 - 4022.48] P:2046.97 E:0.083222 |  And shawn right phillips who came on of course against the usa
[4023.36 - 4026.40] P:1963.98 E:0.088350 |  In that game is coming on now we'll get a word from graham teller in a moment
[4026.40 - 4029.36] P:1988.51 E:0.080925 |  It's john terry tries to head the ball towards the halfway line
[4029.36 - 4034.96] P:2004.24 E:0.079451 |  There are big spaces though in the midfield for england. They're being outnumbered there. They're being outplayed out there
[4035.04 - 4037.60] P:2030.32 E:0.077985 |  They're being out fought in midfield as well as now
[4037.84 - 4040.64] P:1937.08 E:0.083737 |  Algeria send another good ball to bel haja on the far side
[4041.04 - 4043.68] P:1947.60 E:0.069741 |  bel haja into yedam back again to yedam
[4044.00 - 4048.00] P:1953.84 E:0.084826 |  Algeria just teasing england at the moment as they just pass the ball around
[4048.16 - 4052.08] P:1953.00 E:0.083633 |  Then they play the ball across the field of baguera who lays it off neatly to kadeir
[4052.48 - 4056.32] P:1982.06 E:0.081248 |  Here's danger again now if kadeir can get across in ashley clull closes him down
[4056.48 - 4062.24] P:1864.69 E:0.092782 |  Wonderful football the confidence is team shawn considering this team's coming without winning football matches
[4063.04 - 4067.20] P:1967.58 E:0.083543 |  3-0 they lost to the republic of Ireland a few weeks ago in one of their warm-up games
[4068.16 - 4071.68] P:1918.90 E:0.085825 |  But they're holding england and in fact doing more than that really here
[4071.68 - 4075.12] P:1999.00 E:0.080112 |  They're completely frustrating england and now it's lenon who'll be coming off soon
[4075.12 - 4079.92] P:1996.83 E:0.081071 |  We think runy now trying to find some space here runy to johnson over on the england right hand side

[4093.92 - 4100.48] P:2014.03 E:0.089650 |  Normally sweeps those in under his control. Algeria. They'll make a mess of the clearance lampard now finding lenon runy's waiting
[4100.72 - 4103.68] P:2025.01 E:0.099793 |  Lenon with a shot in oh he almost dropped to runy
[4103.68 - 4107.20] P:2027.08 E:0.090281 |  It was a powerful cross in the end from lenon which is taking a deflection off the
[4108.16 - 4112.96] P:1974.28 E:0.094980 |  Algerian defender halish and england have a corner far side gareth barry to take it and now

[4122.40 - 4124.72] P:1989.60 E:0.092450 |  Remember who played on the left against the usa is
[4125.60 - 4128.24] P:2052.34 E:0.097614 |  Sean right phillips just to repeat jamie karigan now

[4140.88 - 4144.56] P:1967.78 E:0.089206 |  Doesn't control it, but there's nobody there to threaten him in a white shirt of england
[4144.80 - 4148.96] P:1998.26 E:0.086527 |  And algeria with a good ball out of defense lovely control again from buda booze

[4157.92 - 4162.24] P:1898.19 E:0.080357 |  They're keeping it and they're moving it all the things that england aren't doing in this game
[4162.72 - 4166.00] P:1905.11 E:0.084963 |  Algeria now buggera that's a tidy ball from him as well
[4166.32 - 4171.84] P:1925.01 E:0.081714 |  england can't get the ball away from algeria just at the moment is now it's given away from ziani
[4172.24 - 4175.52] P:1823.63 E:0.081531 |  And we can bring in graham taylor 18 minutes gone on the second half
[4176.00 - 4180.00] P:1820.57 E:0.098007 |  It's not really any any better graham is it there's no different from the first half

[4182.96 - 4186.32] P:1895.06 E:0.110480 |  To england's advantage really is that what algeria haven't done
[4186.40 - 4190.72] P:1847.77 E:0.097346 |  They haven't had the number of shots that go for all of the possession. They're moving to the ball
[4190.96 - 4196.88] P:1929.04 E:0.099012 |  They've not really hurt england in there in their penalty box and that might yet rescue england
[4197.20 - 4199.44] P:1903.62 E:0.106909 |  But it's the same algeria moving about
[4200.40 - 4202.56] P:1931.20 E:0.099613 |  John terry and james has to come out of his goal
[4203.04 - 4209.68] P:1996.22 E:0.097687 |  And there again you have in a nutshell england's problem here tonight the edginess and the anxiety we talked about lampard
[4210.08 - 4215.44] P:2038.61 E:0.091847 |  Half-harder long ball forward now. Eskia won't get it john terry there. What an earth was he doing?
[4215.92 - 4220.40] P:2061.65 E:0.091400 |  And he really sold david james short and james fortunately from england's point of view
[4220.80 - 4224.00] P:1935.00 E:0.090551 |  Was alive and came out quickly to clear a word from chris wall in the moment
[4224.48 - 4227.36] P:1975.18 E:0.082471 |  And now kariga takes possession again for england. It's just that
[4228.16 - 4234.40] P:1828.95 E:0.075560 |  We can talk about it and technique and movement and looking after the ball and we haven't shown anything tonight
[4234.48 - 4238.00] P:1840.00 E:0.095865 |  We didn't show it a lot in the first game there against america and it's the same old problems
[4238.80 - 4241.92] P:2127.15 E:0.075872 |  Well and longing to hear fabio capello's explanation afterwards
[4241.92 - 4247.92] P:1979.58 E:0.073409 |  On this one he thought they played well against the usa. Well, they've been lamentable so far here tonight
[4248.64 - 4253.44] P:1933.69 E:0.086316 |  And we played over an hour of this game moving towards already the halfway point of the second half
[4254.24 - 4257.68] P:2000.92 E:0.085440 |  england nil algeria nil crowd very quiet for the neutral
[4257.68 - 4261.68] P:2015.03 E:0.087538 |  It's a very poor game so much goodwill in this city for an english football in cape town
[4261.68 - 4267.76] P:1961.42 E:0.082540 |  They must be very disappointed the locals here tonight and now bell hash chases and won't get that over on the far side the field
[4268.72 - 4270.72] P:1910.47 E:0.082150 |  still time for england to
[4271.68 - 4273.52] P:1923.57 E:0.057668 |  Win the game
[4273.52 - 4275.52] P:1971.94 E:0.078588 |  That they're completely lacking
[4276.24 - 4283.04] P:1995.91 E:0.087362 |  Conviction and belief here. Stephen gerrard now sends the ball forward runy. This time doesn't come like i thought he was going to control that
[4283.04 - 4285.04] P:1934.65 E:0.075399 |  But it spins off his ankle once more
[4285.20 - 4289.04] P:1986.63 E:0.087422 |  And algeria looked to go forward until ashley kohl comes in with a sliding challenge
[4289.52 - 4295.92] P:1945.11 E:0.084751 |  And england have a throw in on the halfway down the algerians upset with the decision there by the linesman 20 minutes gone on five live
[4296.00 - 4298.00] P:1988.78 E:0.079941 |  It's england nil algeria nil
[4298.16 - 4299.36] P:1872.52 E:0.061177 |  gareth barry

[4305.84 - 4312.24] P:1978.78 E:0.086373 |  Started the game quite smoothly, but he's tiring and laboring a little bit now in this game kariga for johnson
[4312.32 - 4316.88] P:2049.11 E:0.079498 |  Right phillips is looking for his first touch. He's got it now just inside the algeria half
[4317.12 - 4321.28] P:2009.89 E:0.084956 |  Right phillips taking on bell hash right phillips in the end invited the challenge
[4321.44 - 4328.16] P:1988.34 E:0.090323 |  He's still got a chance here spins away from bell hashing is brought down england have a free kick now can they do something positive here?
[4328.96 - 4330.64] P:1957.81 E:0.102536 |  Well sure no phillips fair play well
[4330.64 - 4333.20] P:2012.38 E:0.102195 |  I thought you'd overrun it kept it in and then bellage dives in

[4337.68 - 4344.48] P:1892.71 E:0.085573 |  Is not being good, but it's always an opportunity for them. It's a young goalkeeper making his first appearance for algeria
[4344.56 - 4347.12] P:1945.83 E:0.095038 |  He's been put under absolutely no pressure at all
[4347.84 - 4352.32] P:1935.09 E:0.083020 |  Can gareth barry do that now with this free kick for england wide on the right?
[4352.88 - 4356.48] P:2035.87 E:0.085755 |  John terry goes forward and belatedly kariga two
[4356.88 - 4362.88] P:2024.32 E:0.091584 |  It's a terrible kick, but it's not cleared well by algeria lampard now tries to turn and pulls the ball back straight to the
[4363.04 - 4365.04] P:1995.56 E:0.084774 |  Algerian defender a yahir

[4370.32 - 4373.44] P:1775.96 E:0.083439 |  Mate, you know the look is if I don't know if they're over train or they do something
[4373.52 - 4377.60] P:1726.65 E:0.092345 |  They just all look so heavy legged with it's a confidence thing and I always talk about it
[4378.00 - 4382.64] P:1870.22 E:0.087468 |  It is a massive fact and especially when you play for england, but a lot of players lack in confidence
[4382.64 - 4388.00] P:1869.46 E:0.068464 |  And I think that's why they're looking tired. It's the tension and it's the anxiety. I think more than anything else
[4388.96 - 4392.24] P:1879.08 E:0.082631 |  Underlined in so many of the performances here tonight such
[4392.96 - 4394.96] P:1783.05 E:0.082998 |  substandard by players who

[4400.16 - 4404.64] P:1980.25 E:0.086777 |  Come and help him out and then the encarger had to hoof it to safety down this near side of the field
[4404.80 - 4406.96] P:1791.34 E:0.097884 |  Well, he needs to come a little bit earlier doesn't he David james?
[4406.96 - 4408.48] P:1858.00 E:0.072867 |  Just you marked all over the field here
[4409.20 - 4412.40] P:1842.76 E:0.087597 |  England nil algeria nil will be going to allen green in a moment

[4417.92 - 4419.92] P:1959.23 E:0.067221 |  And the referee didn't like the challenge
[4420.40 - 4423.12] P:2010.96 E:0.099407 |  So the halfway point three quarters of the way through this game
[4424.24 - 4430.96] P:1911.89 E:0.081221 |  england putting themselves under enormous pressure in this group. It's england nil algeria nil and here is allen green

[4441.76 - 4445.60] P:1964.60 E:0.078391 |  Because frankly, I know what I'm thinking about this performance and I certainly can't say it
[4446.24 - 4452.40] P:1961.50 E:0.077140 |  Gerard coming forward over around the ball and the through it goes to imboy you feeble
[4453.68 - 4459.44] P:1897.39 E:0.078043 |  Absolutely feeble every single one of them. I can't think of any england player that you can excuse at the moment
[4460.16 - 4464.00] P:1934.32 E:0.062358 |  Imboy the goalkeeper who plays in the vulgarian league

[4477.04 - 4479.92] P:1861.83 E:0.078827 |  england will have to beat Slovenia to qualify
[4480.48 - 4482.48] P:1869.24 E:0.055514 |  on five points
[4483.20 - 4485.68] P:1912.32 E:0.066768 |  from arguably the easiest group

[4489.04 - 4490.72] P:1940.16 E:0.051821 |  Here's gerard

[4493.28 - 4498.40] P:1880.93 E:0.090535 |  Barry's leggy throughout frankly, but that's a good pass forward to runny runny's past that gerard was awful
[4498.48 - 4502.80] P:1890.33 E:0.079170 |  I've never seen runny worse playing for england never and i'm sorry. I don't mean to pick on him
[4503.04 - 4506.80] P:1974.98 E:0.076178 |  It's just he's such an outstanding talent. We expect so much more
[4508.56 - 4513.04] P:1947.84 E:0.080324 |  It's with buggera buggera to hallish. You know what they're doing, don't it?
[4513.12 - 4515.60] P:1873.50 E:0.085907 |  They're technically excellent allen. You know the difference
[4516.24 - 4519.84] P:1815.63 E:0.083144 |  We've talked about millions of differences. You know you by the way, but the main thing is
[4520.00 - 4524.08] P:1998.06 E:0.093830 |  They all know where each other is and it's one touch two touch little trick little this
[4524.32 - 4529.76] P:1827.18 E:0.092950 |  They just everybody know they're on the same wavelength where england are just so disjointed to give the ball away
[4530.08 - 4533.44] P:1767.36 E:0.091889 |  They don't know the plain blame passes. They don't know where they're going at times
[4533.76 - 4537.76] P:1877.96 E:0.082735 |  And that's for me whether it's team shape working on it or confidence is the main thing
[4537.76 - 4541.84] P:1868.93 E:0.090672 |  And I don't think many players have got it batmour falls over on the far side of the field
[4542.00 - 4548.24] P:1972.69 E:0.083962 |  And that's fortunate enough for england. He thinks he was fouled, but it's a goal kick to england 21 minutes left
[4548.72 - 4551.36] P:1783.49 E:0.091185 |  Of this pretty abysmal game. Actually, I think karagher fouled him
[4552.88 - 4554.88] P:1812.65 E:0.097882 |  Karagher remember already booked in the game
[4555.76 - 4561.20] P:1959.18 E:0.087542 |  He's shonrite phillips. He's got johnson white to his right johnson mctenneards over the halfway line

[4573.12 - 4576.72] P:1885.29 E:0.082430 |  I did had no conviction whatsoever that haski could finish it
[4576.72 - 4580.24] P:1955.52 E:0.103189 |  I think you try to cross it. He should have hit it hard and low and let the goalie save it
[4580.24 - 4583.68] P:1924.89 E:0.104241 |  He's going to save it. He's trying to pull it back look for a rune running into the far post
[4586.24 - 4590.16] P:1917.80 E:0.096968 |  Barry to take the corner for england 20 minutes left for play
[4591.52 - 4593.52] P:1958.58 E:0.103616 |  Will not forget how bad a game this is
[4594.16 - 4596.16] P:1992.16 E:0.098040 |  But if england can only sneak a win
[4596.72 - 4600.00] P:1904.86 E:0.095343 |  Barry deep cross gerard with a head straight in the goalkeeper for a long range
[4600.24 - 4605.92] P:1978.95 E:0.100150 |  terrible mark in by algeria fell asleep good movement good header by gerard nobody in front of the goalkeeper
[4606.56 - 4609.76] P:1890.78 E:0.101703 |  He gets him one in front of the goal. He's a little a little touching to go
[4609.76 - 4615.52] P:1852.38 E:0.089437 |  But again the goalkeeper holds the ball well bell hatch to lasen lasen put his defender
[4616.24 - 4623.36] P:1876.83 E:0.080673 |  Under fresher, but he clears it up field to map more map more tackled by barry ball bricks at johnson back to karagher
[4623.92 - 4627.36] P:1922.16 E:0.078882 |  And now terry terry to the far side and johnson

[4633.92 - 4636.16] P:1889.35 E:0.085897 |  How poor frank lampire being as well?

[4690.32 - 4694.32] P:1903.99 E:0.077684 |  Anyway, it's head outfield and algeria had the ball back
[4695.12 - 4697.12] P:1896.84 E:0.081399 |  It doesn't get any better does it chris?

[4713.28 - 4716.00] P:1759.71 E:0.087227 |  But it's uh, it's been a very very very poor performance
[4716.80 - 4720.56] P:1845.15 E:0.092666 |  Against a team who's come at this tournament with the worst record in the friendly
[4722.40 - 4727.04] P:1951.93 E:0.086710 |  Well, it seems almost inconceivable to think it but you know rooney
[4727.84 - 4730.40] P:1920.33 E:0.090299 |  Rooney could easily be substituted. He's been that poor
[4731.84 - 4733.84] P:1779.35 E:0.092337 |  Here's jerrod on the halfway line

[4909.84 - 4915.04] P:1975.33 E:0.103400 |  That was a decent run but the ball by gerard. Yes, nice runny spot. I did put he's gone away from the goal
[4915.52 - 4919.28] P:1902.64 E:0.102587 |  And that's all he could do. He tried to hook it in and have worked themselves yet another corner
[4919.68 - 4926.32] P:1869.41 E:0.091929 |  So we've had a wretched free kick from barry a wretched corner by gerard and now lampard is going to take this corner
[4927.36 - 4929.04] P:1983.59 E:0.066008 |  Get it right
[4929.12 - 4936.08] P:1899.88 E:0.085511 |  Hit high looking for terry terry heads it down barry with a shot hits the defender appears for handball can't have been a penalty
[4936.72 - 4939.44] P:1868.06 E:0.091693 |  Can't have been no chance of that and the referee rightly ignores it
[4939.52 - 4943.36] P:1902.75 E:0.095200 |  I think it's alish who's come out and closed it. I didn't know anything about it. He turned on the half
[4943.44 - 4946.00] P:1984.82 E:0.079378 |  It's just bounced up. He's turned. He's it's just hit him
[4946.80 - 4949.04] P:1832.77 E:0.094915 |  14 minutes left for play england corner
[4950.08 - 4955.84] P:1901.07 E:0.083231 |  That almost left over the edge of the algerian penalty here throw goes to terry now taken up by gerard
[4955.92 - 4957.04] P:1944.47 E:0.057856 |  Oh
[4957.04 - 4963.12] P:1924.05 E:0.090328 |  Right Phillips never even looked as he flicked the ball and he shrugged off by abduing the substitute for algeria
[4963.52 - 4967.92] P:1845.37 E:0.086208 |  matmore hits it away towards the far side towards bell hage bell hage
[4968.32 - 4972.96] P:1896.62 E:0.087829 |  Scampers forward towards the england penalty. It's the anne's return pass for by for gokey
[4973.20 - 4978.08] P:1790.83 E:0.102697 |  Well, bell hage wanted it. He played the one two and that is it only for me. Did the right ball bell had pulled up?
[4978.08 - 4982.08] P:1925.02 E:0.087209 |  I don't know why but uh, they've still got that threat on the counter attack, haven't they but
[4982.72 - 4985.76] P:1730.41 E:0.099895 |  They've dropped a little bit deep anne's got a little bit more time on the ball
[4985.84 - 4988.00] P:1958.45 E:0.094098 |  A reminder of the point situation in the group
[4988.64 - 4990.64] P:1935.67 E:0.097792 |  If this finishes level at nil nil
[4990.88 - 4992.88] P:1866.61 E:0.096974 |  Slovenia will be top on four points
[4993.36 - 4997.84] P:1864.46 E:0.090293 |  The usa and england will both have two points in algeria will have one point
[4998.48 - 5002.64] P:1951.54 E:0.087206 |  england would qualify in that scenario if they beat slovenia
[5003.28 - 5005.28] P:1950.25 E:0.084248 |  Huh with this form who knows?
[5005.76 - 5009.28] P:1920.11 E:0.086970 |  Johnson crosses in and uh default tried to dive forward ahead
[5009.60 - 5014.48] P:1881.13 E:0.098735 |  Is a defender headed away and it's another corner to england and they're filling up just a little bit of steam here
[5014.56 - 5016.88] P:1953.57 E:0.102968 |  Well, I would say algea have just come off the pace lately
[5016.88 - 5021.76] P:1900.79 E:0.101649 |  They're dropping a little bit deeper they're letting it come up to the box and putting i'm not saying they're putting good crosses in
[5021.76 - 5023.76] P:1951.62 E:0.084137 |  But no that's what five corners
[5024.24 - 5026.24] P:1891.44 E:0.103708 |  12 minutes to go lampards corner
[5026.80 - 5027.92] P:2058.26 E:0.068356 |  Too deep
[5027.92 - 5033.36] P:1880.19 E:0.078572 |  Headed away jolson heads into barry barry chipson in the penalty here headed up by baguera
[5033.68 - 5035.68] P:1948.26 E:0.094225 |  Johnson still there might break the rune
[5036.16 - 5041.36] P:1912.61 E:0.084047 |  Doesn't break the rune defo though clicks it in the direction of gerard overhead behind for a goal kick
[5042.32 - 5045.12] P:1866.58 E:0.089183 |  It just it looks like they've never worked on a set piece
[5045.68 - 5049.12] P:1836.08 E:0.086656 |  A general play they just don't seem to be on the same wavelength
[5051.92 - 5055.28] P:1830.79 E:0.082978 |  Well graham has continually made the point grand taylor
[5055.84 - 5061.60] P:1889.01 E:0.084103 |  You know that he just understand another why this business of naming the team two hours before kickoff
[5061.92 - 5063.92] P:1833.05 E:0.086480 |  How do you prepare your team?
[5064.08 - 5070.96] P:1838.82 E:0.086442 |  How do you prepare your starting 11 that you presumably decided on sometime earlier for a game when the players don't even know it?
[5072.16 - 5074.08] P:1800.69 E:0.053042 |  Don't understand it
[5074.08 - 5075.68] P:1856.24 E:0.058485 |  here baguera
[5075.68 - 5077.68] P:1931.57 E:0.072261 |  Inside the final dozen minutes
[5077.84 - 5086.16] P:1871.87 E:0.085605 |  Algeria have been the better team throughout the game abdu in the substitute and towards mattenmore half cleared by carragher flags up for offside against abdu
[5086.32 - 5088.32] P:1978.36 E:0.041437 |  Yeah, he's give off side
[5089.04 - 5093.92] P:1780.03 E:0.086885 |  But again, they still have that threat. It's certainly you've got you can't fault. I do that. This is probably
[5094.88 - 5097.68] P:1827.89 E:0.084799 |  You know if you say the manager can you play any better?
[5097.68 - 5098.80] P:1673.72 E:0.087810 |  He's gonna say no
[5098.80 - 5102.88] P:1872.89 E:0.092190 |  Would love a bit more quality in the box alone in the final third, but as for a football team
[5103.36 - 5105.36] P:1905.96 E:0.074309 |  They've played very very well
[5105.44 - 5107.84] P:1927.89 E:0.086108 |  Grand taylor 10 yards away to where I left
[5109.36 - 5110.80] P:1958.86 E:0.062758 |  Still anxious
[5110.80 - 5112.80] P:1970.29 E:0.083397 |  Yeah, still anxious
[5112.80 - 5118.40] P:1867.91 E:0.113145 |  England have come a little bit more into it. I think as much by probably Algeria tiring that little bit
[5119.04 - 5125.60] P:1873.86 E:0.101153 |  And there's no doubt about it that I wouldn't say this is their best spell because you can't hardly use the word best
[5125.60 - 5128.48] P:1895.22 E:0.099837 |  But I think they're just beginning to come into the game
[5129.04 - 5131.92] P:1861.45 E:0.109099 |  And we'll just have to see right at the death if they would win it
[5131.92 - 5135.36] P:1893.57 E:0.098005 |  It would be somewhat unfairly if they do but let's hope that's the case
[5136.00 - 5137.44] P:1838.43 E:0.080690 |  Well, certainly
[5137.44 - 5139.52] P:1722.22 E:0.081672 |  Even if England do win the game
[5139.52 - 5144.48] P:1798.94 E:0.091482 |  Well dare anybody name England is a potential world cup winners on this display the ball played
[5144.72 - 5150.40] P:1861.41 E:0.080197 |  Towards Jared but over hit again the pass and it's behind for a goal kick. Well, why isn't actually Cole on?
[5151.28 - 5154.96] P:1837.13 E:0.080596 |  Ashley Cole he's playing. I'm not actually cold. Sorry the other cold Joe
[5155.60 - 5158.64] P:1816.40 E:0.069485 |  Well, obviously Capello doesn't fancy him simple as that
[5159.12 - 5162.48] P:1824.54 E:0.092394 |  He's warming up down behind the goal with a couple other players milner and
[5163.28 - 5168.56] P:1844.16 E:0.083711 |  Peter Crouch, which I think they've got a look at somebody's going down. It's a ziani. I think he's got cramp
[5169.44 - 5173.28] P:1806.38 E:0.078322 |  Uh, ziani might be coming off. Yeah, he's got cramp because um
[5175.04 - 5176.80] P:1971.60 E:0.062590 |  Guadura
[5176.80 - 5181.92] P:1828.21 E:0.088634 |  The number 17 is coming on. Uh, yeah, it is the any who's gonna going to leave
[5183.12 - 5185.52] P:1864.71 E:0.080748 |  Uh, how many minutes to go 10 minutes to go?
[5186.80 - 5192.08] P:1770.76 E:0.085480 |  Certainly, I don't think there's been a worse world cup game here in South Africa than this one or am I being too harsh?
[5192.88 - 5194.88] P:1920.91 E:0.078956 |  No, I think you're being very fair
[5195.52 - 5199.76] P:1922.61 E:0.088233 |  I've got to say I've enjoyed watching the I'll do your play but they haven't got a cutting edge in the box
[5199.76 - 5201.76] P:1981.97 E:0.065199 |  But the way they play
[5201.92 - 5203.52] P:1919.36 E:0.057053 |  nice on the eye
[5203.52 - 5208.32] P:1881.85 E:0.079352 |  Just amazing me. You know, it's like was down and I keep said probably every world cup would keep saying the same thing
[5208.80 - 5210.16] P:1951.61 E:0.055448 |  technically
[5210.16 - 5212.16] P:1785.16 E:0.088442 |  We just struggled with the ball at the feet
[5214.16 - 5216.16] P:1985.33 E:0.059301 |  Unbelievable
[5216.88 - 5218.88] P:1957.75 E:0.084861 |  Still no no
[5218.88 - 5220.48] P:1799.30 E:0.082013 |  England and Algeria
[5220.48 - 5223.04] P:1796.64 E:0.083757 |  I'm sure as the ante didn't want to come off. But if he's got cramp
[5223.68 - 5225.36] P:1959.41 E:0.061739 |  Really has to
[5225.36 - 5230.96] P:1888.26 E:0.078596 |  And he's sorry just not quite as comfortable over the last few minutes as they've been for most of the game
[5232.08 - 5236.24] P:1939.41 E:0.086423 |  Johnson fair challenge according to the referee close five right Phillip takes it forward
[5236.24 - 5243.68] P:1862.81 E:0.070085 |  But I never looked likely to beat bell haj Algeria have the ball. It's back with uh, you hear the captain
[5243.68 - 5246.16] P:1966.53 E:0.084579 |  You hear switches it towards the right side
[5246.64 - 5248.08] P:1747.16 E:0.069707 |  accurately played
[5248.08 - 5249.28] P:1848.78 E:0.056217 |  Caddy here
[5249.28 - 5252.72] P:1805.95 E:0.085925 |  On to abduin abduin tries to back heal the ball hits Ashley Cole
[5254.56 - 5260.08] P:1944.56 E:0.085113 |  Moves in the direction of runy and really now gets a second chance as jared finds him and then runy loses the ball
[5260.88 - 5264.72] P:1840.02 E:0.079682 |  It is I think without question the worst I've ever seen when runy play for England
[5267.52 - 5273.68] P:1856.50 E:0.083934 |  Nail nail eight minutes left for play 0 500 909 69 3 is the number to call if you want to take part
[5274.40 - 5276.40] P:1970.16 E:0.059331 |  in 606
[5276.56 - 5279.92] P:1817.84 E:0.077569 |  And please just be careful what you say language wise
[5280.88 - 5282.96] P:1896.67 E:0.091332 |  There's a file now and Sean right Phillips
[5283.60 - 5287.76] P:1995.49 E:0.089599 |  Free kick to England is the result just ahead of the center circle slightly to the right
[5289.04 - 5292.08] P:1929.37 E:0.083134 |  Right Phillips takes it to Johnson on the far side of the field
[5292.64 - 5296.08] P:1907.83 E:0.089683 |  Can this England display be redeemed not with a cross like that
[5296.48 - 5299.36] P:1811.02 E:0.085826 |  While the overhead by Glenn Johnson behind for a goal kick
[5300.48 - 5302.48] P:1854.33 E:0.090579 |  I'm sure the ball will be mentioned after
[5303.44 - 5306.96] P:1904.36 E:0.090902 |  But uh funny how I I'll see if they kick it right yeah, they do
[5308.32 - 5313.36] P:1917.35 E:0.066094 |  You know playing it accurately to one another goodness gracious
[5315.36 - 5317.36] P:1841.26 E:0.093344 |  Goal kick taken now by him boy
[5318.64 - 5326.16] P:1795.77 E:0.077063 |  Less than eight minutes to go cherry hits it back. Here's jared jared finds lampard lampard dinks it in the direction of Johnson
[5326.24 - 5331.92] P:1932.40 E:0.081219 |  Johnson on to right Phillips in the far side of the field defos a head of right Phillips was never looking on field
[5331.92 - 5333.92] P:1968.12 E:0.058542 |  Place it back to Glenn Johnson
[5333.92 - 5336.24] P:2012.00 E:0.093835 |  It's almost at walking pace as Johnson moves
[5337.04 - 5340.72] P:1865.41 E:0.089287 |  Across the halfway line Peter Kroger is going to come on last resort now
[5341.76 - 5343.20] P:2036.30 E:0.060315 |  Here's Barry
[5343.20 - 5349.76] P:1944.55 E:0.076449 |  to lampard lampard to right Phillips and on to the far side the England right and Johnson
[5350.16 - 5352.72] P:1802.83 E:0.089581 |  Into lampard you're outside the penalty area
[5353.28 - 5355.28] P:1797.20 E:0.079768 |  lampard almost tripped in the ball
[5355.28 - 5361.76] P:1953.12 E:0.082892 |  Feature to the right side to Johnson Johnson easily loses it far too easily loses it. He's at a poor game
[5361.92 - 5366.16] P:1912.03 E:0.090976 |  They've all had a poor game. He's in and there's a chance that the ball was played in the left side towards bellhage
[5366.32 - 5371.04] P:1840.52 E:0.079305 |  But it never reached them because right Phillips managed to block that pass up field and it started play for throw
[5371.04 - 5375.60] P:1723.42 E:0.097207 |  Well, he was in Glenn Johnson just let him run if you played the ball early and properly he was away
[5376.88 - 5380.08] P:1941.69 E:0.082145 |  There's crouch for heskey. No, heskey's already gone. It's for
[5380.72 - 5382.72] P:1892.19 E:0.064942 |  Gareth Barry for Barry
[5383.36 - 5386.72] P:1863.75 E:0.093687 |  To Gerald goes sent a mid way and runy left wing
[5387.12 - 5391.12] P:1981.06 E:0.058308 |  It's hardly been worth a place in the team runy in this display
[5391.28 - 5394.16] P:1933.31 E:0.078697 |  I think Mike's ready to throw himself off the country now
[5394.72 - 5398.64] P:1921.53 E:0.086336 |  He's having a terrible time Michael taking this performance in
[5399.28 - 5402.48] P:1899.26 E:0.084254 |  And I'm not sure how much he's looking forward to talking to Fabio Capella
[5402.48 - 5408.48] P:1902.03 E:0.088619 |  I'll certainly be fascinated to hear what Capella says about this and he comes over the same sort of dribble as he did after the US game
[5408.48 - 5413.92] P:1857.70 E:0.075980 |  And he said he thought we played well. I think he will wow come off. What will laugh at him?
[5414.16 - 5417.36] P:1866.30 E:0.084289 |  Well, when does he ever not say when does he ever criticize never?
[5417.36 - 5423.36] P:1821.96 E:0.076407 |  Well, I'm sorry, but that'll be able to laugh for me thinks that this England display has been other than pathetic
[5424.16 - 5426.16] P:1876.46 E:0.046727 |  England 0 Algeria 0
[5426.16 - 5428.16] P:1921.04 E:0.080868 |  6 minutes to go here in Cape Town
[5428.16 - 5430.16] P:2026.67 E:0.073296 |  We've hardly had a chance worthy of the name
[5430.16 - 5432.16] P:1953.15 E:0.067835 |  Well, they are me for all all juries
[5433.36 - 5436.32] P:1887.14 E:0.088350 |  Good play. They have created it. No, no, no, no
[5436.32 - 5439.68] P:1823.71 E:0.074571 |  They tell you what though. I'll have they come and said when they went the World Cup
[5439.68 - 5441.68] P:1737.38 E:0.098697 |  What was their object?
[5442.56 - 5446.16] P:1775.21 E:0.095188 |  What was their object if they say we're drawing and we do that to that qualifies them
[5446.16 - 5448.88] P:1779.35 E:0.084081 |  And that was their game plan and they've had this set out for weeks
[5449.20 - 5453.28] P:1973.16 E:0.084143 |  Default to right Phillips over the half way line mind in the center circle brought down
[5454.24 - 5459.28] P:1885.22 E:0.082447 |  That's certainly a free kick might well be a yellow card. Yep. It is to Lassen. Yep
[5459.36 - 5463.12] P:1972.98 E:0.088880 |  So they didn't need no Bellagio just took it off. We do all by running right Phillips
[5464.32 - 5469.92] P:1820.17 E:0.088031 |  A reminder of the number for 606 0 590 9 6 9 3 and we take the free kick too quickly
[5470.80 - 5473.28] P:1998.65 E:0.082582 |  Now they take it to the referee satisfaction
[5473.84 - 5481.28] P:1908.79 E:0.077972 |  Lampard onto Johnson down the right side into right Phillips right Phillips spins beats the defender does he tries to get the cross in
[5481.52 - 5487.28] P:1862.55 E:0.095761 |  Partially blocked behind for a corner. That's big corner number six from that right hand side. I've got a lot of joy getting down out of here
[5487.28 - 5489.28] P:2031.67 E:0.083106 |  Yeah, but no good deliveries
[5489.44 - 5491.44] P:1918.65 E:0.084813 |  Five minutes to go on five line

[5494.16 - 5496.16] P:2019.17 E:0.064988 |  Wretched game
[5496.56 - 5501.52] P:1925.38 E:0.088876 |  Quarter for England lampart from the right inch was the near post to foe went to meet it and I think
[5502.08 - 5505.12] P:1780.54 E:0.091128 |  Arguably that came off the defender in the end. They come off the foes back
[5505.84 - 5508.72] P:1980.11 E:0.077632 |  Yeah, he has still stayed down. Maybe he's a clashed heads
[5509.28 - 5512.56] P:1688.00 E:0.108110 |  We'll see. There was a long Gerrard. There was a file on Gerard
[5513.12 - 5517.68] P:1840.32 E:0.080426 |  That certainly wasn't spotted but anywhere to go kick. What do we know about it? Come off the foes back
[5520.56 - 5524.80] P:1843.89 E:0.084430 |  You know, I'm gonna struggle to think of anything good to say about England tonight
[5525.52 - 5528.96] P:1870.53 E:0.084761 |  Nothing they were they were far better playing against the US than this
[5531.36 - 5534.16] P:1863.37 E:0.084836 |  And I you know, I'll do you have played well
[5534.80 - 5535.76] P:1899.06 E:0.032898 |  but
[5535.76 - 5539.28] P:1872.08 E:0.084427 |  Their lower category opposition. Let's face it in terms of world football
[5539.68 - 5542.56] P:1852.75 E:0.080920 |  So you want the technique is far superior England's
[5543.36 - 5548.40] P:1825.30 E:0.084794 |  Bell had running down the left flank Carragher gets there plays it back to James and James
[5548.96 - 5550.96] P:1718.99 E:0.092393 |  Bell said over the halfway line towards

[5574.72 - 5579.52] P:1915.95 E:0.087457 |  Rebounded a foe who loses it and then it's won by lampart who gives it away
[5580.56 - 5582.56] P:1898.72 E:0.089316 |  Lamentable display by England
[5582.88 - 5585.76] P:1887.78 E:0.094716 |  Three and a half minutes ago another shot by Algeria
[5586.32 - 5590.00] P:1915.33 E:0.083278 |  beaten away by the England defense Rooney was being followed Rooney keeps his feet
[5590.56 - 5596.48] P:1931.86 E:0.083728 |  Good advantage played by the referee then Rooney's pass was wildly over adventurous towards right Phillips
[5596.72 - 5598.72] P:1909.04 E:0.082106 |  And it's back in the possession of Algeria
[5599.12 - 5600.56] P:1815.92 E:0.052845 |  with matlow
[5600.56 - 5606.56] P:1799.27 E:0.077660 |  To bell hatch in the far side into the lesson over the halfway line left to the center circle and plays it back
[5607.04 - 5611.20] P:1936.17 E:0.076617 |  To Halleesh Halleesh towards this near side and Cadir
[5611.52 - 5614.88] P:1874.52 E:0.088604 |  Cadir tackled by Ashley Cole called it well winning the ball
[5615.44 - 5620.56] P:1907.32 E:0.081173 |  Rooney leaves it for Gerard Gerard now to lampart inside the center circle onto Johnson
[5620.88 - 5624.80] P:1950.66 E:0.083540 |  They're still trying to redeem this not the poverty of the display
[5625.20 - 5630.32] P:1871.40 E:0.083658 |  But getting the three points not with a shot like that from 35 yards by lampart well white
[5630.80 - 5636.40] P:1867.38 E:0.096441 |  Well, I think everything will be coming up on your phone in allen. I'm sure that listen the boos listen the boos
[5636.88 - 5639.92] P:1908.50 E:0.087446 |  And who would blame them? But yeah, they've got a fair point
[5640.00 - 5643.68] P:1844.98 E:0.095381 |  But uh, you know when it boils down to it, I'll still sign now and I said at any day
[5643.76 - 5650.80] P:1883.05 E:0.072512 |  I think it's every world cup now. We are very inferior on technique and that's simple. It's short tonight again
[5651.68 - 5656.24] P:1921.56 E:0.096081 |  We've got a little over two minutes to go plus out of time another change for Algeria
[5657.04 - 5661.20] P:1835.08 E:0.073103 |  Um, I can see it's the number 20 coming on for the number 19

[5666.32 - 5668.00] P:1882.54 E:0.050876 |  a defender
[5668.00 - 5671.20] P:1784.94 E:0.084837 |  And uh, well, they're just tiny things up. They're taking the point now aren't they?
[5671.44 - 5676.32] P:1787.82 E:0.101713 |  This is a game point. But actually they've been worthy of all three. They'll be they'll believe they can beat the usa
[5677.20 - 5679.20] P:1985.73 E:0.057689 |  And that may get them through
[5679.68 - 5681.68] P:2059.26 E:0.044422 |  Oh
[5682.00 - 5686.16] P:1950.70 E:0.091236 |  Well, let's hope they do beat the usa well, we'll see the way things are
[5686.96 - 5688.96] P:1908.36 E:0.081909 |  They love the big center forward back
[5689.44 - 5691.44] P:1956.58 E:0.090761 |  But England will have to beat Slovenia
[5692.24 - 5696.32] P:1896.69 E:0.087497 |  Now they should be able to beat Slovenia, but they should have been able to beat Algeria
[5697.36 - 5700.40] P:1649.00 E:0.081092 |  And America we're not taking we're not taking anything for granted now because
[5701.60 - 5705.84] P:1884.50 E:0.081161 |  England just haven't performed at this world cup at all a minute and a half
[5706.24 - 5710.16] P:1857.17 E:0.082487 |  To go England ill Algeria nil on five lie the
[5711.20 - 5713.20] P:1885.56 E:0.095388 |  Rune's pulling the Algerian player to his feet
[5714.08 - 5716.56] P:1824.71 E:0.094442 |  Unconvinced by the injury to matmore
[5717.52 - 5719.52] P:1899.47 E:0.082332 |  And he thinks that was just wasting time
[5720.00 - 5725.36] P:1861.17 E:0.078376 |  I did be Beckham showing a lot of frustration there and you know, I've always been a big critic of Beckham
[5725.60 - 5729.20] P:1875.10 E:0.079116 |  I'll tell you what some decent delivery from the flanks wouldn't have gone a miss tonight
[5730.48 - 5732.48] P:1884.88 E:0.055067 |  Beckham would have done that
[5732.64 - 5734.40] P:1917.57 E:0.053225 |  bell hage
[5734.40 - 5739.52] P:1947.67 E:0.087924 |  To take the free kick as we enter the last window of the game flick did take the old game didn't really come
[5739.68 - 5742.08] P:1751.17 E:0.096486 |  He caught the ball, but he was under pressure
[5743.12 - 5745.76] P:1911.85 E:0.097510 |  Under serious pressure there's that baguero has gone down injured
[5746.32 - 5750.48] P:1952.37 E:0.078196 |  James belt the ball out of place so that but baguero can receive treatment
[5750.64 - 5754.80] P:1807.74 E:0.094657 |  So that was a good delivery by bell hage wasn't it a lot of bodies in there give day with james credit
[5754.80 - 5757.60] P:1999.78 E:0.085828 |  He kept his eyes on it took it at his waist chest high
[5759.20 - 5761.20] P:1506.76 E:0.109011 |  But a lot of bodies flying around in front of him well done
[5762.00 - 5764.00] P:1923.83 E:0.060011 |  I think baguero is all right
[5764.48 - 5769.52] P:1908.28 E:0.076251 |  But I get the feeling number of players have gone down for Algeria and recent minutes suggest that you know
[5769.92 - 5772.64] P:1747.77 E:0.064337 |  Take the point what he expects. No played well
[5773.76 - 5777.52] P:1899.88 E:0.090342 |  That paper would be saying heroes. What lowers me saying zero so, you know
[5778.56 - 5780.80] P:2030.51 E:0.084160 |  They'll be delighted with this performance. I'll do it
[5781.36 - 5785.12] P:1929.60 E:0.089641 |  Throwing to Algeria in the far side of the field worth the fourth official
[5785.92 - 5790.88] P:1933.97 E:0.083070 |  The the board when he holds it up and tells us how much time will be added on for that
[5790.88 - 5796.80] P:1938.83 E:0.082534 |  It will be very critical for england. No, he hasn't lifted the board yet. He's moving to the touch line now

[5835.04 - 5838.48] P:1936.96 E:0.094008 |  Well, we've been unjust as let's be honest. We'd love to see that went in
[5839.60 - 5841.60] P:1889.99 E:0.091073 |  We'd love it to go in but let's be honest
[5842.48 - 5844.48] P:1894.94 E:0.082300 |  Algeria being a better side
[5845.04 - 5847.68] P:1845.20 E:0.089179 |  I don't think I don't think england even deserve the point
[5849.20 - 5851.52] P:1807.38 E:0.093000 |  So a win would be daylight robbery
