[151.52 - 156.64] P:1843.26 E:0.290406 |  fruition in 2021 yeah it'd be really important that we get off to a decent
[156.64 - 162.36] P:1742.00 E:0.298246 |  start get get those nerves to put to one side if we possibly can and make sure
[162.36 - 167.28] P:1520.18 E:0.300314 |  we can get an ascendancy in the game England in all whites are defending
[167.28 - 171.36] P:1644.82 E:0.348751 |  the end away to our right-hand side and Raeson Sterling has the ball this week
[171.36 - 176.44] P:1499.92 E:0.374866 |  play back for Kieran and now to Tyrone Mings takes a couple of touches and
[176.44 - 182.24] P:1462.42 E:0.368732 |  hits a comfortable confident pass to John Stones to his right back out the car
[182.24 - 186.36] P:1471.20 E:0.376808 |  Walker back for Jordan Pickford in all yellow today
[186.36 - 192.04] P:1473.01 E:0.368723 |  Pickford has only conceded four goals in his last nine games for England
[192.04 - 196.92] P:1451.93 E:0.383100 |  and he clears this one left footed a high ball for Harry Gaines trying to isolate
[196.92 - 201.24] P:1470.09 E:0.358453 |  himself against the blonde-haired familiar figure of Domagoy Vita at the heart
[201.24 - 205.68] P:1673.98 E:0.358821 |  of the Croatian defense Croatia win the second ball Trippie went down hurt
[205.68 - 210.04] P:1613.65 E:0.316609 |  thought that he should have had a free kick got back to his feet play went on
[210.04 - 214.36] P:1339.72 E:0.324529 |  and Declan Rice can mop up and find Calvin Phillips who will just work it
[214.36 - 219.24] P:1377.80 E:0.354625 |  back for stones an hour towards Carl Walker again Walker playing it for down
[219.24 - 224.08] P:1638.57 E:0.354099 |  the England right for the newly blonde Phil Foden who just loses possession
[224.08 - 227.60] P:1620.33 E:0.340874 |  Rosovic gives him a little shove in the midfield after the ball had been played
[227.60 - 231.40] P:1655.57 E:0.327879 |  forward England can lock up comfortably again in the right back position it's
[231.40 - 236.72] P:1607.52 E:0.332143 |  been decent steady early possession with a couple of minutes gone at nil-nil on
[236.72 - 242.24] P:1358.96 E:0.359918 |  Torxburg I hope I'm wrong Jim but people suggest him beforehand this isn't the
[242.24 - 247.64] P:1394.70 E:0.377590 |  Croatia of a couple of years ago I think this will be a very stern test when
[247.64 - 253.48] P:1349.74 E:0.366544 |  you can see consider the complexity is of a first game in a major tournament
[253.48 - 258.24] P:1263.75 E:0.359001 |  like we're going into now the nerves of that and it will be important that we do
[258.24 - 262.76] P:1477.74 E:0.346380 |  get off to a decent start maybe turn the opposition round on occasion as well
[262.76 - 268.28] P:1411.09 E:0.356778 |  not playing front of them so readily such as for me just a little fear of the
[268.32 - 273.44] P:1608.24 E:0.368802 |  ball and this is first match in a major tournament as it is for Mason Mount
[273.44 - 278.80] P:1579.10 E:0.342387 |  who's in possession now way forward into the feet of Raheem Sterling his control
[278.80 - 282.84] P:1768.20 E:0.343865 |  is neat and tidy trying to turn away from Rosovic the midfield enforcer for
[282.84 - 287.60] P:1668.21 E:0.356995 |  Croatia in the lay back for stones now for the Walser Walker midway inside
[287.60 - 292.00] P:1687.86 E:0.324305 |  Croatian territory Sterling drifting over to inside right for a moment Foden
[292.00 - 296.28] P:1432.70 E:0.350915 |  leaves the ball but the whistle is gone as the free giver should be taken by
[296.28 - 300.96] P:1496.99 E:0.333640 |  Croatia as a foul on the perisic over on the fire touch line and Croatia have
[300.96 - 305.08] P:1572.65 E:0.352171 |  the opportunity just to regroup England coming into this on the back of six
[305.08 - 311.92] P:1542.79 E:0.337689 |  straight wins their best run since the one seventh in a row back in the 2014-15
[311.92 - 317.12] P:1506.47 E:0.350825 |  season but as has been well documented England do not have a good record in the
[317.12 - 322.32] P:1440.66 E:0.338898 |  opening game of this tournament nine played haven't won any of them five
[322.36 - 326.84] P:1394.52 E:0.335266 |  draws and four defeats Croatia on the other hand unbeaten in their opening
[326.84 - 331.60] P:1394.89 E:0.316550 |  game of the year owes winning all but one they're in possession now with the
[331.60 - 336.64] P:1526.06 E:0.360702 |  19 year old Vardio who becomes the first team major to play for Croatia in a
[336.64 - 341.08] P:1481.84 E:0.369403 |  major tournament he's laid it back for Charity Sa the Marseys had a half from
[341.08 - 346.32] P:1580.57 E:0.332700 |  him to Vida that walks the right back to Salico he's just lost possession just
[346.32 - 350.52] P:1590.69 E:0.325766 |  worried about where the ball is gonna go next and laid it off and Raheem Sterling
[350.52 - 354.28] P:1570.04 E:0.299015 |  was in there to win it but Luca Modric quickly won it back he can play it
[354.28 - 357.32] P:1801.92 E:0.353671 |  for now for Kovacic who will drive forward towards the edge of the penalty
[357.32 - 362.52] P:1556.36 E:0.317690 |  area perisic's the outboard of his left hand side in the sunshine of north
[362.52 - 366.56] P:1621.22 E:0.338064 |  London still on the fire touch line perisic's coming back finding Modric
[366.56 - 370.56] P:1865.00 E:0.325524 |  perisic with an opportunity to try and take on Karl Walker he checks against it
[370.56 - 374.52] P:1695.80 E:0.306179 |  on to his right foot still can't deliver defending good enough Vardio will be
[374.52 - 377.32] P:1827.89 E:0.339078 |  able to bring it forward Modric around the edge of the penalty area trying to
[377.32 - 382.48] P:1679.93 E:0.332318 |  go through but the whistle has gone pick from Ashley made a decent save after
[382.48 - 388.12] P:1571.29 E:0.304102 |  free kick was given and it's an opportunity for England just to be able
[388.12 - 392.12] P:1424.40 E:0.330182 |  to get the ball out of harm's way from the back nil nil four minutes gone on
[392.12 - 396.76] P:1597.27 E:0.352036 |  talk sport yeah just looking at a midfield shape of Rice Phillips and
[396.76 - 401.80] P:1685.87 E:0.336875 |  Mount it's Rice he was sort of being a central figure and the deeper of the two
[401.80 - 405.68] P:1723.69 E:0.351891 |  allowing Phillips on the right hand side just to flourish a little bit push
[405.84 - 410.84] P:1454.30 E:0.336551 |  on look on to people same with Mount as well so it I think it'll be rice you
[410.84 - 414.80] P:1538.83 E:0.353854 |  will be asked to get in and around Modric to make sure he doesn't see any
[414.80 - 419.08] P:1529.13 E:0.378704 |  space there the referee that's the stock legs the ball hit him it was a drop
[419.08 - 423.16] P:1643.78 E:0.364291 |  ball to Croatia which they went out he was the right hand touch line and gave
[423.16 - 427.52] P:1441.98 E:0.336151 |  away sending a high ball sailing over the head of the Salico and now for a
[427.52 - 430.00] P:1305.12 E:0.368512 |  throw which be taken on the England left hand side
[430.16 - 434.88] P:1394.95 E:0.353797 |  Strubears and Sol Campbell alongside me Jim Brown from here at Wembley under the
[434.88 - 438.56] P:1647.42 E:0.374582 |  arch on a glorious day his sterling out to bring the ball forward and find Foden
[438.56 - 442.16] P:1856.18 E:0.331797 |  takes it into his stride will check left foot he shot across the face of goal
[442.16 - 447.96] P:1758.23 E:0.354744 |  he's the inside of the post and Vardy Olli's out of clear his first contribution
[447.96 - 452.84] P:1724.93 E:0.356379 |  in the major tournament so nearly ending up in a goal great interplay between
[452.84 - 457.88] P:1656.67 E:0.322191 |  Sterling and Foden and Foden has it again just play back towards Carl Walker
[458.24 - 463.68] P:1515.40 E:0.349677 |  what a start that would have been Foden again checking laying it back for Calvin
[463.68 - 472.52] P:1645.10 E:0.365313 |  Phillips he just has a swagger about him Foden born to succeed at major
[472.52 - 477.80] P:1606.88 E:0.313908 |  tournaments you would think with his style of play his competencies confidence
[477.80 - 482.60] P:1563.05 E:0.314968 |  and wonderful ability in possession and very nearly giving England a six minute
[482.88 - 488.08] P:1632.00 E:0.317050 |  I think that's just shown that we don't need to play at Croatia's tempo and
[488.08 - 493.04] P:1526.18 E:0.316098 |  speed we need to play at our own speed and tempo and the pace we've got up
[493.04 - 497.16] P:1701.74 E:0.331742 |  front and the threat we got up front the more we can service those front players
[497.16 - 502.88] P:1751.22 E:0.265448 |  and the quicker we can do it the better top quality effort there by Foden it was
[502.88 - 508.16] P:1518.37 E:0.278824 |  just the liquor paint on the inside of the post that kept that one out
[512.64 - 518.32] P:1787.14 E:0.336696 |  rolled away from him and goes out of play interesting that Croatia started with
[518.32 - 522.96] P:1726.40 E:0.278254 |  Rebic playing up front Krameric playing on the the right wing
[522.96 - 529.36] P:1691.61 E:0.264559 |  anti-Rebic playing through the middle scored against Argentina in the last
[529.36 - 534.56] P:1604.13 E:0.308945 |  World Cup and scored 11 league goals in each of his two seasons with Milan
[534.56 - 539.16] P:1406.65 E:0.275933 |  Andre Krameric who has been absolutely prolific for often I'm nearly a hundred
[539.20 - 544.80] P:1449.70 E:0.259626 |  goals in less than 200 games but he started off on the right Declan Rice
[544.80 - 547.60] P:1626.38 E:0.328963 |  heading the ball away through the midfield with Torxport seven gone
[547.60 - 551.20] P:1662.70 E:0.297115 |  England have already hit the frame of the goal but haven't hit the net and it's
[551.20 - 557.52] P:1602.85 E:0.282762 |  nil nil Rice laying it back towards John Stones the referee's whistle has gone
[557.52 - 562.60] P:1244.32 E:0.191787 |  again it's a free kick which will be taken by England
[562.88 - 570.28] P:1404.18 E:0.236926 |  mings down to Trippia Kiran Trippia sending a long left footed ball for us
[570.28 - 573.16] P:1518.34 E:0.344693 |  and that's the run from Mount who will go down towards the corner flag he's
[573.16 - 578.56] P:1628.32 E:0.266760 |  drawing Vida out of position Mount's able to get good possession just on the
[578.56 - 582.60] P:1576.58 E:0.320219 |  left hand touch like fighting Sterling Trippias made a run for for him on the
[582.60 - 586.64] P:1695.16 E:0.328794 |  the overlap works in field instead towards Mason Mount into the feet of
[586.64 - 590.60] P:1901.96 E:0.326872 |  Kane Kane trying to turn inside here Sterling takes it on but can't get a
[590.60 - 594.08] P:1844.96 E:0.349556 |  shot in it's a corner Kane thought that he might have had a penalty and
[594.08 - 597.88] P:1868.38 E:0.344051 |  Sterling maybe had a penalty shot as well as Charlie the star came across but
[597.88 - 602.36] P:1793.62 E:0.344793 |  it is gonna be an England corner yeah I think what we're seeing here England
[602.36 - 606.76] P:1751.49 E:0.315408 |  playing at a tempo that is really causing Christ are a bit of a problem and
[606.76 - 610.96] P:1742.18 E:0.299364 |  my advice would be don't be shy and getting the ball forward get it in
[610.96 - 614.96] P:1619.75 E:0.355469 |  behind their back line for runners whether it be Mount whether it be Sterling
[614.96 - 620.04] P:1881.03 E:0.311273 |  and it will cause them a big problem so this first corner is gonna be a Mason
[620.08 - 625.52] P:1713.17 E:0.220147 |  Mount in swinging delivery from the England left-hand side and he's got
[625.52 - 630.12] P:1724.24 E:0.233658 |  four in and around the edge of the six-yard box Tara means is making a
[630.12 - 634.16] P:2014.79 E:0.319950 |  slightly later on it's so deeper towards John Stones who's just beaten it's a
[634.16 - 638.24] P:1876.85 E:0.322365 |  volley right footed folly from the edge of the penalty area well hit by Calvin
[638.24 - 643.28] P:1943.08 E:0.315071 |  Phillips and it was a decent save from Levakovic you got down to his right hand
[643.28 - 648.04] P:1723.64 E:0.248486 |  side ball cleared out of play for a throw this has been a bright promising
[648.04 - 654.04] P:1775.76 E:0.249783 |  start as far as down south gates men are concerned no no but England have asked
[654.04 - 660.16] P:1721.01 E:0.247236 |  the most potent and pertinent questions in the opening nine minutes Tyrone
[660.16 - 664.88] P:1631.23 E:0.233965 |  means just down into the little thin corridor of shadow on the left hand
[664.88 - 669.16] P:1702.95 E:0.281713 |  touch on the near side as far as we look at it with rice playing it for for
[669.16 - 673.44] P:1716.38 E:0.260895 |  Mount Mount back for Sterling to Rice again options to his right hand side
[673.48 - 679.44] P:1820.58 E:0.248418 |  include Walker Walker playing it for now towards Foden Foden controlling it neatly
[679.44 - 683.88] P:1787.62 E:0.250111 |  works it away from Perisic just playing it back in towards the edge of the penalty
[683.88 - 688.96] P:1599.16 E:0.282812 |  area John Stones will twist away he finds Walker Walker back out for Stones
[688.96 - 694.76] P:1718.59 E:0.234476 |  again Stones about eight or nine yards inside the Croatian half four from
[694.76 - 699.44] P:1895.61 E:0.282773 |  Foden deflected out of play for a throw which be taken on the England right-hand
[699.44 - 703.72] P:1772.47 E:0.297164 |  side I think it's really important Jim that England if they've got a forward pass
[703.72 - 707.96] P:1725.50 E:0.263525 |  make that forward pass don't come out don't play safe because I think that's
[707.96 - 712.24] P:1865.83 E:0.324404 |  really causing a problem Kane firing it inside the penalty area wonderful scoop
[712.24 - 716.00] P:1757.23 E:0.311105 |  in with the outside of the right boot after a great move between him and Foden
[716.00 - 720.44] P:2045.83 E:0.318010 |  Phillips then does well to retain possession with two Croatians around
[720.44 - 726.08] P:1971.88 E:0.296676 |  him Rosovic snapping at his heels but he maintained it very well this has been
[726.08 - 732.72] P:1601.82 E:0.221626 |  an excellent starting when playing at a decent tempo no sign of any real early
[732.72 - 738.00] P:1740.23 E:0.270266 |  nerves taken the game to the opposition sure hasn't always been the way in the
[738.00 - 741.40] P:1842.16 E:0.281166 |  first match of a major tournament and can read so much from the opening
[741.40 - 747.20] P:1721.34 E:0.188303 |  exchanges his mount mount back for Phillips Walker making a good early
[747.20 - 750.40] P:1654.06 E:0.315552 |  run down the England right-hand side just couldn't quite control it and it
[750.40 - 755.60] P:1849.97 E:0.255871 |  drifts away and goes out of play for a front yeah they've really had problems
[755.60 - 762.20] P:1729.87 E:0.251629 |  with with players sterling Foden mount just coming off and dropping in a
[762.20 - 767.68] P:1736.58 E:0.298105 |  little wide areas to receive and just having a little look at the volley from
[767.68 - 772.20] P:1854.34 E:0.281790 |  Phillips absolute sensational volley watched it straight on to his four went
[772.20 - 776.40] P:1611.47 E:0.280827 |  through legs and the goalkeeper done very well to parry out he's still waiting
[776.40 - 780.16] P:1763.99 E:0.306804 |  for his first goal for England Calvin Phillips only a ninth count for him
[780.16 - 784.64] P:1634.89 E:0.248815 |  today only made his debut back in September very different England side
[784.68 - 787.44] P:1838.92 E:0.328349 |  in this first game that it would have been in the first game of the tournament
[787.44 - 792.68] P:1894.22 E:0.290335 |  in 2020 came fighting Foden now inside the penalty area Foden just laying it
[792.68 - 796.40] P:1892.67 E:0.312012 |  across the edge of the box too far ahead of Mason Mount he can get there but
[796.40 - 800.20] P:1872.85 E:0.284770 |  can't run on to it and get a shot in back it goes from sterling to Mount again
[800.20 - 804.24] P:1471.86 E:0.273252 |  on the corner of the penalty area with about making a run down the inside left
[804.24 - 808.88] P:1724.67 E:0.263281 |  channel work back instead for Foden but control lots and eat entirely that time
[808.88 - 812.76] P:1674.15 E:0.230065 |  and opportunity for Kovacic to put his foot on the ball
[812.80 - 817.92] P:1752.71 E:0.247468 |  Sariqo then playing about for Kovacic again Croatia try and bring it forward
[817.92 - 821.76] P:1926.29 E:0.348101 |  for Brozovic has given it away it was a relatively simple pass to Luka Modric
[821.76 - 826.36] P:1812.76 E:0.287537 |  but he's missed him by four or five yards and it goes out of play for an
[826.36 - 829.48] P:1640.89 E:0.306573 |  England throw on the left hand touch line you would talk sport in 11 minutes
[829.48 - 833.12] P:1687.54 E:0.297195 |  gone England no Croatian ale yeah I think England start has been that
[833.12 - 837.16] P:1777.92 E:0.321187 |  positive after the first maybe four or five minutes since then we've really
[837.16 - 840.76] P:1739.40 E:0.307364 |  up the tempo we've looked to threatening behind we've got in a good
[840.76 - 846.04] P:1842.26 E:0.275513 |  space in the final third and it's almost rock the Croatians a little bit
[846.04 - 850.60] P:1913.37 E:0.309959 |  possession in the low 70s for England in these early stages and it's been good
[850.60 - 854.20] P:1863.06 E:0.283146 |  possession as well not keeping the ball for keeping the ball's sake his
[854.20 - 858.90] P:1851.52 E:0.256202 |  trippier chipping it in Kane trying to flick it on behind him and a good
[858.90 - 864.52] P:1830.44 E:0.242285 |  mopping up Perisic who comes back inside his own penalty area from the left
[864.52 - 869.24] P:1912.24 E:0.282248 |  wing lays it back for Vida Vida out towards the right back for Sariqo he
[869.24 - 872.92] P:1839.04 E:0.325238 |  just gets it for hoping that Rebic can make something of it for him he did
[872.92 - 876.20] P:1852.42 E:0.316315 |  actually he headed a ball through the midfield to make it another fight ball
[876.20 - 880.00] P:1829.12 E:0.285284 |  which Modric could get on the end of then for Sariqo with a dainty little chip
[880.00 - 885.48] P:1696.85 E:0.207179 |  will flick it down the touch line he finds Kramaric little nutmeg there with
[885.48 - 890.24] P:1608.41 E:0.229977 |  Modric ending up in possession now back for Marcelo Brozovic again
[890.24 - 894.36] P:1756.62 E:0.303564 |  Brozovic such an experienced customer in the heart of the midfield winning his
[894.40 - 901.16] P:2001.49 E:0.239725 |  60th count for his country the Inter Milan player lays it back to Chalata
[901.16 - 906.52] P:1843.29 E:0.267895 |  Sariqo from him to Vida scored in the World Cup quarter-final three years ago
[906.52 - 912.52] P:1890.65 E:0.220699 |  he gets Russia forward from the back Brozovic out towards the very impressive
[912.52 - 919.56] P:1904.97 E:0.248374 |  left-sided defender Gvadijal so such a bright future ahead of him just 19 but
[919.76 - 925.32] P:1625.17 E:0.248590 |  it's just been signed in a 16 million euro deal by Leipzig his Kira and Trippia
[925.32 - 930.72] P:1665.45 E:0.238707 |  much the more experienced of the two-man playing left-back today from him to
[930.72 - 934.92] P:1650.79 E:0.277645 |  Mings to stones back for Mings again Mings controlling it inside his own
[934.92 - 939.40] P:1650.80 E:0.286467 |  half then sending it forward long left-footed ball which is easily headed
[939.40 - 944.52] P:1728.52 E:0.271109 |  away by Vesalico but straight to Mason Mount and Raheem Sterling has it now
[944.52 - 949.52] P:1756.33 E:0.228720 |  coming in off the left hand touch like stops and checks Modric forces him to
[949.52 - 954.68] P:1580.86 E:0.236704 |  go back for Kira and Trippia Trippia back for Mings Sterling to Mings again
[954.68 - 960.04] P:1499.35 E:0.247786 |  and his bright yellow boots on a glorious day beautiful summer's afternoon
[960.04 - 965.24] P:1421.59 E:0.211470 |  here in north London Sterling back for Mings again inside his own half and
[965.24 - 970.36] P:1727.64 E:0.261073 |  he'll just emerge from that corridor of shadow which probably covers about a
[970.36 - 975.44] P:1687.94 E:0.250250 |  third of the pitch or so back he goes for stones stones under pressure from
[975.48 - 981.32] P:1894.32 E:0.220397 |  Rebic to Mings again Mings to Trippia they're just passing it along the
[981.32 - 984.64] P:1919.49 E:0.320943 |  back line now Mings will look long Sterling trying to take it on the half
[984.64 - 988.28] P:1915.68 E:0.293157 |  turn away from Vesalico is winning his 50th count for his country today
[988.28 - 993.56] P:1629.98 E:0.218811 |  Croatia will it back and Brozowicz goes back for Vida Vida finds his goalkeeper
[993.56 - 998.96] P:1749.60 E:0.246739 |  who's happy just to slam it upfield Perisic will flick it on but stones is
[998.96 - 1002.96] P:1763.91 E:0.288786 |  there to mop up and get it back for Jordan pick for 14 minutes gone much to
[1003.00 - 1006.40] P:1859.88 E:0.303677 |  recommend the early stages of this England performance we hear from Sol
[1006.40 - 1009.40] P:1766.39 E:0.302825 |  Campbell in a moment but these are the thoughts of Stuart Pierce yeah I think in
[1009.40 - 1013.64] P:1717.76 E:0.311737 |  games like this when we've had a really good start in the game it's a
[1013.64 - 1017.72] P:1867.95 E:0.329530 |  concentration from the from the back line make sure they filled the ball
[1017.72 - 1022.28] P:1723.72 E:0.270204 |  into midfield and up front and get us playing definitely from that situation
[1022.28 - 1027.52] P:1640.04 E:0.296914 |  and don't play down to Croatia Croatia want to slow the game down and take the
[1027.52 - 1032.52] P:1642.13 E:0.282850 |  sting out the game it's important that we play to a tempo and a speed that
[1032.56 - 1037.00] P:1679.41 E:0.292267 |  suits our players we are a very athletic side it's important we play to
[1037.00 - 1041.80] P:1725.82 E:0.280012 |  that that high tempo stones finds Walker and it goes back to his Manchester City
[1041.80 - 1046.68] P:1823.47 E:0.301788 |  teammate now played out to Manchester City man in Trippia Sterling chips it
[1046.68 - 1052.20] P:1845.63 E:0.273655 |  forward awkward bounce for Vida to deal with Philips is in there to regain
[1052.20 - 1055.72] P:1925.42 E:0.339485 |  possession for England in the engine room and then Mount ever busy just a
[1055.72 - 1059.20] P:1916.44 E:0.303251 |  flicks it off for Sterling down towards Mount again on the left-hand side of the
[1059.20 - 1063.96] P:1901.04 E:0.239779 |  penalty area now just stops and checks right for the ball just took a deflection
[1063.96 - 1067.76] P:1985.29 E:0.311049 |  on its way in Phil Foden just give a little shove under the flight of the
[1067.76 - 1072.52] P:1849.44 E:0.291150 |  ball for Sally co can then claim knocked away Kane brings it forward but Vida
[1072.52 - 1076.04] P:1974.21 E:0.332985 |  gets that one clear around the edge of the penalty area and then Philips was
[1076.04 - 1082.08] P:1967.86 E:0.312708 |  caught and it's a free kick to England about 15 yards outside the penalty area
[1082.08 - 1088.00] P:1922.05 E:0.287902 |  in a central position right at the very extreme of range for anybody fancing a
[1088.00 - 1092.28] P:1614.88 E:0.279471 |  shot not in that too dissimilar a position to that the Kearn trip you put
[1092.28 - 1096.16] P:1697.77 E:0.311260 |  in against Croatia in the World Cup semi-final yeah it's not in a bad area
[1096.16 - 1100.68] P:1584.90 E:0.326335 |  I would say probably slightly too deep and as per normal I hope I've put my
[1100.68 - 1104.36] P:1817.66 E:0.288763 |  foot right in my mouth there and he sinks it in the back of the net but it's
[1104.36 - 1109.60] P:1850.84 E:0.293792 |  certainly some distance that he's got to a to to generate whether it be a little
[1109.60 - 1115.16] P:1995.82 E:0.257534 |  chip up to potentially stones he's just pulled out to the left it is very
[1115.20 - 1118.56] P:1846.81 E:0.328182 |  central so difficult to get an angle on the ball really for that little clip
[1118.56 - 1123.44] P:1829.34 E:0.286756 |  towards either side of the box Foden on the right hand side of the penalty area
[1123.44 - 1127.60] P:1777.51 E:0.283424 |  stones will be much the more obvious target on the left mounts and trippier
[1127.60 - 1131.08] P:1688.44 E:0.271683 |  of the two players standing over it here for England it showed a distance
[1131.08 - 1135.64] P:1811.53 E:0.273377 |  Croatia have not even got a wall it is just clips in looking for Kane Kane with a
[1135.64 - 1139.24] P:1940.71 E:0.288799 |  little flick header it's claiming that he was pulled down the offside flag is up
[1139.24 - 1144.04] P:1696.57 E:0.248677 |  though and it's going to be a free kick for Croatia inside their six-yard box
[1144.04 - 1148.44] P:1846.86 E:0.308916 |  17 minutes gone England now Croatia now with her from Stuart Pierce a soul
[1148.44 - 1151.60] P:1511.53 E:0.342889 |  Campbell a part of our team as well for the England games here on Talksport
[1151.60 - 1154.92] P:1624.18 E:0.305109 |  so great start plenty to recommend I think it's a great so it's definitely a
[1154.92 - 1159.88] P:1688.20 E:0.300525 |  great start I think we are high the back line is high we're confident
[1159.88 - 1165.16] P:1567.45 E:0.303186 |  Croatia haven't got going that's because we've been pushing and probing and not
[1165.16 - 1168.60] P:1661.11 E:0.307239 |  giving them any a second to kind of settle down which is called to keep it
[1168.60 - 1172.48] P:1731.80 E:0.317801 |  going and make sure the low make sure we don't kind of fall asleep there's
[1172.52 - 1176.28] P:1920.32 E:0.226842 |  always about it's always about concentration at international football
[1176.28 - 1181.08] P:1747.55 E:0.267554 |  England have the ball over on the far touch line midway inside their own half
[1181.08 - 1185.60] P:1683.54 E:0.222591 |  it's gonna be throw which car Walker will take Croatia and finish top of their
[1185.60 - 1189.76] P:1569.85 E:0.320715 |  qualifying group above Wales but they have been beaten seven times this
[1189.76 - 1194.04] P:1739.89 E:0.258790 |  season which is hardly vintage form to come into a major tournament being twice
[1194.04 - 1200.44] P:1761.44 E:0.257536 |  by Portugal twice by France by Sweden and Slovenia and a more excusable
[1200.48 - 1203.76] P:1524.43 E:0.325294 |  friendly defeat to Belgium last week where they went down one nil in their
[1203.76 - 1207.36] P:1438.08 E:0.317477 |  final warm-up game but the penultimate warm-up game is a one or draw at home to
[1207.36 - 1212.12] P:1864.15 E:0.266043 |  one mania which was a very inauspicious result for them and that was with a
[1212.12 - 1215.68] P:1826.31 E:0.332158 |  strong side a much stronger side than England put out for their two friendly
[1215.68 - 1219.56] P:1899.65 E:0.289683 |  victories on T side Phil Foden's got possession on the England right
[1219.56 - 1225.16] P:1834.84 E:0.241490 |  darting twisting turning a little pirouette but couldn't just the con his
[1225.16 - 1228.64] P:1916.75 E:0.334957 |  way through good sliding chance from Calvin Phillips that wasn't quite how
[1228.68 - 1232.48] P:1756.62 E:0.323274 |  the referee saw it for was a foul as he won the ball a little bit overzealously
[1232.48 - 1236.44] P:1854.43 E:0.277188 |  on the edge of the box and it's a free kick that Croatia will take played 18
[1236.44 - 1241.00] P:1755.11 E:0.281364 |  minutes England hit the post very early on with Phil Foden but it has been a
[1241.00 - 1246.76] P:1647.89 E:0.263961 |  very bright start England next in action against Scotland here Friday night
[1246.76 - 1252.04] P:1487.39 E:0.190519 |  you knew that already eight o'clock to kick off time if you're a Scotland fan

[1284.80 - 1288.44] P:1876.71 E:0.305719 |  little shove of the ball from red it you knew exactly what he was doing there
[1288.44 - 1293.00] P:1774.67 E:0.251872 |  just catching stones on the top of the back the stones back on his feet very
[1293.00 - 1297.80] P:1800.70 E:0.242266 |  quickly wasn't hurt but was offended about England if maintained possession
[1297.80 - 1301.60] P:1649.75 E:0.260419 |  and work it all the way back for Jordan Pigford tomorrow another three games

[1327.16 - 1330.88] P:1686.76 E:0.305318 |  clear that one and then as Walker works it back in the clear that one as well
[1330.88 - 1337.60] P:1902.43 E:0.225163 |  charity SAR volling it away the tripier nods it down there's a good purpose about
[1337.60 - 1343.00] P:1447.30 E:0.217566 |  England a good temp on the vast majority of the time as well and if there were
[1343.04 - 1349.68] P:1758.31 E:0.210377 |  question marks when the team was leaked this morning and those that were in and
[1349.68 - 1352.80] P:1284.08 E:0.297489 |  those that weren't I think that Garth will already point to the performance
[1352.80 - 1356.40] P:1864.77 E:0.304297 |  over the first 20 minutes to say that the the team selection has been entirely
[1356.40 - 1361.32] P:1587.77 E:0.273423 |  justified but no way through as yet Sterling laying it back for tripier who
[1361.32 - 1365.56] P:1437.91 E:0.302349 |  had already scored one these two met in the World Cup semi-final by this stage
[1365.56 - 1370.20] P:1649.55 E:0.248367 |  I remember that England play Croatia in the Nations League since then it was

[1395.16 - 1398.92] P:1693.36 E:0.300134 |  ice-crammer shot a play for a throw that'll be taken on the England left-hand
[1399.12 - 1403.04] P:1660.89 E:0.309437 |  that many clear-cut goal-scoring opportunities in 21 minutes to it and
[1403.04 - 1406.84] P:1846.48 E:0.284164 |  just that the two for England but still the possession is good they're having
[1406.84 - 1411.68] P:1484.20 E:0.270916 |  any good areas and there's nobody that really looks below the pace for him no
[1411.68 - 1416.20] P:1825.50 E:0.325912 |  and I looked to look through the start in 11 I thought you know who's showing
[1416.20 - 1420.16] P:1787.68 E:0.314740 |  good form for their club and the only one you might have back into the season
[1420.16 - 1425.80] P:1654.48 E:0.241209 |  would have a question mark is Raheem Sterling form for his club and to be
[1425.80 - 1430.04] P:1779.38 E:0.306389 |  fair to him he's been sensational for England but lost four or five years at
[1430.04 - 1434.56] P:1815.33 E:0.286090 |  least and he's earned his place in in this team the rest of them all got good
[1434.56 - 1438.72] P:1886.87 E:0.281281 |  club form and they've certainly shown that and I tell you who impresses me and
[1438.72 - 1442.48] P:1729.53 E:0.335439 |  probably goes under the radar a little bit Calvin Phillips his energy to get
[1442.48 - 1448.48] P:1768.89 E:0.290434 |  near people to go and press to offer he almost does two jobs he's used to playing
[1448.48 - 1451.88] P:1726.28 E:0.322167 |  that way for Leeds they play high energy and he certainly adds that to the
[1451.88 - 1456.76] P:1764.41 E:0.215077 |  midfield and when England are out of possession he will drop back and partner
[1456.76 - 1460.60] P:1680.65 E:0.316703 |  Declan Rice in there but when they have it he's so eager to be on the front foot
[1460.60 - 1464.72] P:1607.44 E:0.254939 |  and to get forward at every conceivable opportunity they certainly playing a good
[1464.72 - 1468.36] P:1660.55 E:0.324270 |  10 15 yards in front of Rice and being able to take up station around the edge
[1468.36 - 1472.40] P:1603.69 E:0.268021 |  of the penalty area a position that you're balling him also plays well that
[1472.40 - 1477.16] P:1643.94 E:0.283380 |  is Phillips that has been given the nod from the start today and has had an
[1477.16 - 1481.44] P:1774.10 E:0.280857 |  excellent start to this his first game in a major tournament it's nil nil with
[1481.48 - 1485.84] P:1735.12 E:0.258505 |  Salliko in possession bringing the ball forward just trying to take on the
[1485.84 - 1491.04] P:1854.61 E:0.298662 |  Raheem Sterling who maybe gave him a little shove but did so surreptitiously
[1491.04 - 1495.40] P:1732.90 E:0.248981 |  Sterling actually stays down injured for a moment but Trippie is there to get it
[1495.40 - 1499.92] P:1532.28 E:0.216486 |  away and he got it over the halfway line for Kane to chase and feeder and
[1499.92 - 1503.68] P:1619.39 E:0.296209 |  receiving the awkward ball from his subcenter half-partner Chalice Saar but
[1503.68 - 1508.52] P:1515.65 E:0.259872 |  the Ada Brozovic Croatia been able to mop it up pretty neatly on the halfway
[1508.56 - 1513.48] P:1485.61 E:0.192276 |  line now Luca Modric will lay it back for Brozovic again and Kovacic
[1513.48 - 1516.48] P:1800.17 E:0.295277 |  champions league winner with Chelsea brings the ball through the center
[1516.48 - 1521.60] P:1895.86 E:0.316327 |  circle for Croatia Modric taking on got away from Trippie went down is waved up
[1521.60 - 1527.44] P:1890.56 E:0.260086 |  by the referee and Trippie's challenge was certainly firm and Modric far from
[1527.44 - 1531.64] P:1567.61 E:0.253471 |  happy England get the ball upfield and the Croatian goalkeeper Levachevich
[1531.64 - 1535.64] P:1566.50 E:0.281357 |  plays out from the back away from Foden yeah certainly looked like a fail to me
[1535.64 - 1540.96] P:1621.63 E:0.242513 |  and certainly Modric thought that as well but so made a very good point about
[1540.96 - 1545.84] P:1881.57 E:0.305794 |  concentration at the highest level earlier and he's very much that is the
[1545.84 - 1550.60] P:1731.02 E:0.273981 |  case when you step up from club football to international level yet as a defender
[1550.60 - 1556.04] P:1788.91 E:0.294776 |  especially you have to sniff danger before danger is anywhere near where you
[1556.04 - 1560.24] P:1777.17 E:0.287477 |  are on the pitch for Salica right for the ball swung inside the box it's the
[1560.28 - 1564.88] P:1824.89 E:0.291420 |  first ball from out wide that England have had to defend and Tyrone Mings did
[1564.88 - 1569.56] P:1725.84 E:0.300390 |  so very ably coming across again in his head to it steering it out of play for
[1569.56 - 1573.84] P:1541.90 E:0.293291 |  a Croatian throw level the edge of the England penalty area taken quickly by
[1573.84 - 1578.36] P:1473.21 E:0.244523 |  over Salica back from him to so Brozovic now to
[1578.36 - 1584.88] P:1409.12 E:0.198068 |  Chaleta Saar was in that World Cup squad but hardly featured in the tournament
[1585.16 - 1591.12] P:1702.44 E:0.219560 |  for now the Brozovic Matio Kovacic they were to bring it forward and work it out
[1591.12 - 1596.64] P:1546.81 E:0.223880 |  towards the left-hand side Vardio playing at left back but I think he will end up
[1596.64 - 1600.92] P:1898.68 E:0.295205 |  being you said a half in the not too distant future at international level
[1600.92 - 1604.56] P:1801.03 E:0.272517 |  as well as club level his right footed ball just a little bit too steep and
[1604.56 - 1608.64] P:1639.00 E:0.275130 |  that's a sailed straight out of play for a goal kick that'll be taken by Jordan
[1608.64 - 1612.28] P:1700.20 E:0.306311 |  Pickford 24 minutes gone in the sunshine England nil Croatian nil on

[1630.56 - 1634.52] P:1458.24 E:0.323091 |  speaking to all the men that matter again in the reaction of down south gate
[1634.52 - 1639.48] P:1446.97 E:0.324398 |  and the headline makers will hear from Jose Mourinho as well as the most in-depth
[1639.76 - 1644.20] P:1531.02 E:0.328531 |  analysis of the game with song and with Stuart that's all remarks that is at
[1644.20 - 1650.40] P:1402.86 E:0.274093 |  the conclusion of this game and every England game on talk sport 25 gone nil
[1650.40 - 1654.96] P:1572.20 E:0.314009 |  now throw taken quickly by Trippier he's sterling well the idea was right
[1654.96 - 1660.00] P:1744.50 E:0.267243 |  finish wasn't as he just let the ball bounce in front of him and it set up
[1660.00 - 1663.08] P:1606.21 E:0.329519 |  nicely for him but he's hooked the top of his right foot underneath it and he
[1663.08 - 1667.64] P:1532.12 E:0.307424 |  screwed it away with cut spin and it's gone started wide and ended up going
[1667.68 - 1672.00] P:1411.68 E:0.329389 |  ever wider of Lovakovic's goal nil now I ain't trying to put myself in the in
[1672.00 - 1676.16] P:1524.87 E:0.354886 |  the minds eye of the Croatian manager here will be a little bit disappointed
[1676.16 - 1681.20] P:1395.80 E:0.324119 |  England players are getting a lot of space in in that sort of middle to last
[1681.20 - 1685.40] P:1730.89 E:0.336790 |  third area and on that occasion it was sterling you should have done a lot
[1685.40 - 1689.44] P:1751.37 E:0.308267 |  better to be honest Kramaric shot a plate forward here for Revis and mings did
[1689.44 - 1694.00] P:1672.34 E:0.305364 |  well got back to all side and in his gets it for the left hand touch line so much
[1694.04 - 1698.16] P:1556.74 E:0.323447 |  more composure and confidence in his performance today than that that we saw
[1698.16 - 1705.52] P:1288.75 E:0.236425 |  last week in the games against Austria and Romania was I think that he might
[1705.52 - 1708.64] P:1451.30 E:0.357210 |  have played his way out of contention for a place in the starting line up but
[1708.64 - 1712.92] P:1621.58 E:0.296279 |  God's shown faith in him and he's justified it so far mings trying to get
[1712.92 - 1717.16] P:1649.07 E:0.313921 |  the ball away this time can't quite get a contact on it and they fell in behind
[1717.16 - 1721.44] P:1796.82 E:0.345049 |  of the perisic near the edge of the penalty area but his shot way off
[1721.48 - 1726.72] P:1586.22 E:0.285074 |  and out of play for a goal kick nil now it's that type of interaction that we've
[1726.72 - 1730.88] P:1668.25 E:0.342243 |  just seen there the Croatians going down the right hand side whip cross no
[1730.88 - 1735.36] P:1587.79 E:0.326881 |  one got first contact to clear and it ended up being a hitch kick probably
[1735.36 - 1740.40] P:1522.41 E:0.331234 |  just on the edge of the box and it's just those little interactions that we've
[1740.40 - 1744.12] P:1666.41 E:0.371988 |  seen that have caused us a problem we saw it in the last two friendlies last
[1744.12 - 1748.52] P:1573.78 E:0.338729 |  week these wide no one taking control of cutting the cross out or dealing with
[1748.56 - 1753.96] P:1563.48 E:0.307386 |  the cross and players just getting a little bit too much space to potentially
[1753.96 - 1759.32] P:1397.70 E:0.311786 |  get a shot away England's record on home soil has been absolutely fantastic
[1759.32 - 1764.56] P:1490.76 E:0.316374 |  they've had 15 of the last 16 home games with the sole exception being the
[1764.56 - 1770.12] P:1432.71 E:0.244684 |  defeat of Denmark back in October in that run of 16 games have scored average of
[1770.12 - 1778.36] P:1330.56 E:0.243479 |  three a game and only conceded seven all told in fact it's 24 home wins in 26
[1778.40 - 1780.36] P:1163.72 E:0.275825 |  if you go back that little bit further
[1780.36 - 1784.84] P:1352.11 E:0.296631 |  Southgate only beaten twice on the home soil as the England manager
[1784.84 - 1789.52] P:1250.44 E:0.284569 |  Croatia have possession but not in an area that's going to hurt England they're
[1789.52 - 1793.32] P:1637.56 E:0.307781 |  much nearer the edge of their own penalty area than the centre circle
[1793.32 - 1796.36] P:1491.60 E:0.274460 |  Kovacic just lays it back for Luca Modric
[1796.36 - 1799.92] P:1396.02 E:0.325064 |  England have done an effective job on stopping Modric playing so far but he's
[1799.92 - 1803.56] P:1602.86 E:0.325107 |  found some space this time and he's found Vardion making his way forward in
[1803.60 - 1809.48] P:1497.85 E:0.270364 |  space down that left hand touch line back from Modric again Rice comes forward
[1809.48 - 1813.76] P:1575.30 E:0.284236 |  but can't get close enough to fully engage with Modric uses his range of
[1813.76 - 1818.56] P:1463.47 E:0.318406 |  passing again working with the Vesalico now play four by Modric into Krammerich
[1818.56 - 1822.00] P:1715.38 E:0.322987 |  on the edge of the penalty area good control from him he's back to the
[1822.00 - 1826.00] P:1688.17 E:0.315047 |  direction of play back out for Vesalico England have eight back in the penalty
[1826.00 - 1830.84] P:1698.33 E:0.332877 |  area to defend this and they send in one full back towards the other but again
[1830.88 - 1835.32] P:1646.59 E:0.311409 |  over hit for Cardiola and out of play for a goal kick that'll be taken by Jordan
[1835.32 - 1840.68] P:1628.51 E:0.313301 |  Pickford 28 gone and it's nil nil Sturpeyers yes I was pleased to see that
[1840.68 - 1845.28] P:1555.52 E:0.330897 |  crossover hit the creations have loaded all bases up in our box and it was
[1845.28 - 1850.40] P:1576.71 E:0.305038 |  Vardion with the far post who just got away from Foden but crossed slightly too
[1850.40 - 1854.60] P:1401.70 E:0.301410 |  far for him so what do you want to see more of so far bearing in mind that
[1854.60 - 1857.80] P:1503.20 E:0.352035 |  England have dominated possession in an excellent half hour but have only had the
[1857.80 - 1862.36] P:1387.67 E:0.327471 |  one shot on target but definitely a bit of more of this you know especially from
[1862.36 - 1867.04] P:1350.08 E:0.307725 |  the goal kicks play out you know that's the situation it's four versus two you
[1867.04 - 1872.84] P:1334.10 E:0.293351 |  can get out easy a bit more confidence I think you know allowing Croatia to
[1872.84 - 1878.92] P:1518.96 E:0.301279 |  slowly creep into the game look passes done wide it's concentration but it's
[1878.92 - 1882.76] P:1352.71 E:0.356457 |  also recognizing Croatia yeah when they're holding the ball the slender game
[1882.76 - 1886.36] P:1402.25 E:0.318742 |  down they're picking their passes the slowly kind of getting the foot holding
[1886.36 - 1890.04] P:1402.60 E:0.296295 |  the game we've got to kind of react to that and and see and feel what they're
[1890.04 - 1892.68] P:1307.89 E:0.324899 |  trying to do and get hold of the ball as well especially in the middle of the
[1892.68 - 1896.08] P:1330.60 E:0.286999 |  park and also playing out we've got to get that kind of confidence back because
[1896.08 - 1900.48] P:1618.43 E:0.276950 |  they're slowly slowly chip away us that's all Campbell alongside at
[1900.48 - 1904.72] P:1607.41 E:0.328075 |  Sturpeyers Amnesian Brownford here at Wembley Marksaggers in the chairfaker
[1904.72 - 1908.72] P:1568.03 E:0.339546 |  others are England correspondent Declan McCarthy are in stadium producing
[1908.72 - 1914.80] P:1291.17 E:0.320093 |  your England team for the European championships is nil nil with 29 minutes
[1914.84 - 1921.24] P:1378.62 E:0.300526 |  gone here at Wembley and the fans just a little bit muted I think over the last
[1921.24 - 1926.44] P:1334.10 E:0.331910 |  ten minutes or so there's an undercurrent of singing as you can hear
[1926.44 - 1933.48] P:1226.63 E:0.257133 |  around the stadium but no real hugely vociferous support England will play out
[1933.48 - 1938.56] P:1381.61 E:0.304768 |  from the the back against stones to rice and they fall down the line by Walker
[1938.56 - 1941.84] P:1394.88 E:0.302888 |  and the last three or four minutes have been England's worst three or four
[1941.88 - 1946.84] P:1426.86 E:0.322877 |  minutes off the game but no harm done I should try to take a throw very quickly
[1946.84 - 1952.32] P:1327.43 E:0.295350 |  there but from the the wrong place the Italian referee was alive to that let's
[1952.32 - 1955.68] P:1534.22 E:0.355185 |  just ask for it to be retaken that's allowed England to get their shake back
[1955.68 - 1960.12] P:1316.88 E:0.284281 |  behind the board I think the pattern of the game gym is dictated when we've
[1960.12 - 1963.84] P:1398.61 E:0.312227 |  dictated to the opposition we've been comfortable caused them a problem and
[1963.84 - 1968.96] P:1552.36 E:0.283857 |  the creations have been feeding off scraps relatively within the game and
[1968.96 - 1973.28] P:1534.33 E:0.306077 |  we've just let them into the game it's more not so much what they've done
[1973.28 - 1976.92] P:1431.53 E:0.339173 |  probably more what we haven't done and it's hoping the door for them to get a
[1976.92 - 1981.04] P:1272.89 E:0.309118 |  little bit of confidence on the ball well he always gonna be able to bring it
[1981.04 - 1984.92] P:1681.89 E:0.336352 |  forward again now slinking up with perisic on the Croatian left cross the
[1984.92 - 1989.24] P:1742.13 E:0.324644 |  second deflection mings did well to come across a sweep it away on the half
[1989.24 - 1994.36] P:1600.70 E:0.280936 |  volley Rosovic mobs up lays it back for cover chitch cover chitch will take it
[1994.36 - 1998.08] P:1519.38 E:0.323921 |  on and get away from Foden play for towards the edge of the penalty area
[1998.28 - 2003.00] P:1770.63 E:0.317581 |  cover chitcha continuing his run can work it why perisic can control it he'll
[2003.00 - 2006.40] P:1781.31 E:0.329101 |  try and get down towards the ball against it in red bitch was waiting for it
[2006.40 - 2010.28] P:1634.06 E:0.289194 |  but Declan Rice so alert came back and cut out the cross it was vital for
[2010.28 - 2015.32] P:1288.64 E:0.270685 |  England that he did so and Croatia will have to backpedal and not it with
[2015.32 - 2019.48] P:1406.03 E:0.325846 |  Canada saw back to his own goalkeeper Levakovich and now they will build from

[2281.88 - 2285.88] P:1464.85 E:0.350897 |  got to be a little bit quicker you know I think a slow build up and not playing
[2285.88 - 2290.68] P:1588.49 E:0.298543 |  that forward pass to get a player turned on the ball suits the Croatians at the
[2290.68 - 2298.68] P:1253.92 E:0.212546 |  tempo they want to play Mount back inside his own half for Declan Rice

[2319.84 - 2324.20] P:1729.00 E:0.329909 |  what's photon into the penalty area and Fodenway back up by the referee who has
[2324.48 - 2328.92] P:1563.28 E:0.283372 |  let plenty go so far has been very consistent at Daniela your Sato and
[2328.92 - 2333.60] P:1676.37 E:0.341192 |  the ball is played for by Perisic out of harm's way for Croatia and one back by
[2333.60 - 2337.76] P:1524.01 E:0.363236 |  Walker but that was better from England a little more purposeful and the crowd
[2337.76 - 2341.60] P:1733.51 E:0.353516 |  reacting accordingly a sterling desperate to get on the ball drops deep
[2341.60 - 2348.28] P:1621.14 E:0.286414 |  shows for Declan Rice Rice obliges with a little side footed ball for back it
[2348.28 - 2352.88] P:1540.07 E:0.317575 |  goes towards mings now Walker turning it between the two set of halves but safely
[2352.92 - 2357.48] P:1352.08 E:0.293761 |  back to his goalkeeper and England able to get another 10 15 yards upfield with
[2357.48 - 2362.64] P:1389.06 E:0.271672 |  the defensive line trying to condense the play in the midfield stones wide for
[2362.64 - 2365.56] P:1402.60 E:0.325725 |  Walker back it goes again for Jordan Pickford and we're eight from hard time at
[2365.56 - 2371.04] P:1524.27 E:0.282893 |  0-0 yeah my advice to the likes of sterling mount that the front three
[2371.04 - 2376.52] P:1521.32 E:0.293721 |  really behind Harry Kane every time you get it try and get turned once you get
[2376.52 - 2381.24] P:1374.32 E:0.276409 |  turned go and take somebody on because every time we've done that that they
[2381.28 - 2386.68] P:1540.50 E:0.281151 |  can't live with us we've got too much ability to my too much pace too much
[2386.68 - 2392.84] P:1564.52 E:0.267529 |  endeavor now came John rather challenge of a salico loose ball squirms back for
[2392.84 - 2398.52] P:1593.50 E:0.270343 |  Calvin Phillips Phillips wide for Walker again this a tendency to go sideways
[2398.52 - 2403.08] P:1535.31 E:0.254923 |  rather than forwards at times for England his Mason mount another play that
[2403.08 - 2405.96] P:1373.52 E:0.313972 |  England haven't quite been able to get into the game as much as they would like
[2405.96 - 2410.80] P:1608.01 E:0.287448 |  sterling has seen plenty of it and there was a moment about 30 seconds 40
[2410.84 - 2415.08] P:1559.83 E:0.303591 |  seconds ago where he made his way for him Vita steps up for the defensive line
[2415.08 - 2421.24] P:1468.59 E:0.285412 |  and follows him and that is Croatia journalist telling me an area where
[2421.24 - 2425.00] P:1562.76 E:0.337396 |  England might be able to exploit them Calvin Phillips is offside here but when
[2425.00 - 2429.00] P:1537.80 E:0.322728 |  you have Vita stepping up from the defensive line it creates space for
[2429.00 - 2433.44] P:1423.84 E:0.323199 |  people running in it was a sterling that created that space on that occasion
[2433.44 - 2436.08] P:1428.57 E:0.312584 |  that's what England need to try and make the most of well we've done it on a few
[2436.08 - 2439.52] P:1496.08 E:0.307133 |  occasions I mentioned earlier you know probably about four or five times we've
[2439.56 - 2444.08] P:1518.56 E:0.309891 |  looked to play that ball into those channels from from varying distances and
[2444.08 - 2448.80] P:1410.46 E:0.309518 |  it's an Achilles heel especially with a pace that we've got from from our players
[2448.80 - 2454.04] P:1517.26 E:0.303056 |  of the likes of Foden and Sterling to get into those areas once you get in there
[2454.04 - 2459.24] P:1456.49 E:0.285508 |  you normally faced with a one-on-one situation 38 on the clock it's nil nil
[2459.24 - 2464.04] P:1666.16 E:0.327080 |  the back of it's the Croatian goalkeeper who's been first choice since 2019
[2464.56 - 2470.20] P:1456.53 E:0.241148 |  taking his time about this free kick which he sends swirling forward now and
[2470.20 - 2474.96] P:1342.76 E:0.243931 |  then the flag is up again and so an offside of the other end as Andy
[2474.96 - 2478.36] P:1503.95 E:0.271139 |  Rebic should just come back from an offside position still nil now also a
[2478.36 - 2482.56] P:1356.39 E:0.291588 |  really important point to make as well I think certainly with the attacking
[2482.56 - 2488.04] P:1335.73 E:0.303552 |  minded players in the team they almost like there's no point saving yourself
[2488.04 - 2493.20] P:1652.61 E:0.294044 |  physically for games not with the modern day substitution situation chances are
[2493.20 - 2497.88] P:1586.81 E:0.291833 |  Garovs going to make changes in in the advanced areas of the pitch you can
[2497.88 - 2502.28] P:1501.75 E:0.302026 |  almost go out and say look blitz it for an hour and then we'll get impact subs
[2502.28 - 2508.20] P:1289.16 E:0.234230 |  coming on. Inglour working the long ball forward again and towards the the right
[2508.20 - 2511.96] P:1577.40 E:0.321723 |  hand touch line Karl Walker there's nothing in the middle for him he tried to win a
[2511.96 - 2517.04] P:1636.90 E:0.289560 |  corner by bending a right foot he crossed in but he missed his man and it's
[2517.04 - 2521.80] P:1309.80 E:0.268613 |  gone out of play for a goal kick. Five minutes to go to halftime so Campbell
[2521.84 - 2525.36] P:1427.97 E:0.308624 |  part of our team here on Talksport so what are your thoughts?
[2525.36 - 2530.28] P:1374.01 E:0.306666 |  Just like Pearson was saying that kind of ball those third man runs into the
[2530.28 - 2536.68] P:1431.67 E:0.323281 |  into the space you know it is causing a lot of problems but it's all about
[2536.68 - 2541.64] P:1374.93 E:0.308983 |  once we get into that last third and we made that run it's the next ball in it's
[2541.64 - 2545.28] P:1333.00 E:0.342055 |  the cutback who's following through you need someone coming in and you know as
[2545.28 - 2549.88] P:1412.62 E:0.296353 |  of the box cutback shot we need to have an end product we can't kind of get into
[2549.92 - 2553.24] P:1361.99 E:0.298623 |  the box and then we're thinking about what's what we're gonna do with it we
[2553.24 - 2557.20] P:1477.52 E:0.317812 |  need those runners in there we need that kind of that magic that kind of someone
[2557.20 - 2561.40] P:1451.43 E:0.316494 |  making an unselfish run and getting into the box we need that and when we do that
[2561.40 - 2564.32] P:1234.16 E:0.298786 |  we're gonna you know we're gonna cause them problems but at a moment when the
[2564.32 - 2568.32] P:1546.64 E:0.308714 |  game has slowed down we possession it's all about possession we've got to keep
[2568.32 - 2571.84] P:1576.53 E:0.344726 |  possession more but now I don't know what's going on there's a lot of
[2571.84 - 2577.08] P:1417.62 E:0.360398 |  discussion going on with the keeper and nings and I don't know there's a little bit of
[2577.80 - 2585.60] P:1472.45 E:0.332597 |  they're scared or something's going on there's too much discussion going on for my
[2585.60 - 2588.92] P:1364.10 E:0.337307 |  like and it should be just let's go on and play and see what we can do
[2588.92 - 2591.92] P:1657.47 E:0.363712 |  that means we'll have on board over the top of Sterling will run on to it and
[2591.92 - 2595.60] P:1779.92 E:0.334590 |  get their first round the edge of the penalty area and win a free kick
[2597.60 - 2601.44] P:1786.10 E:0.360338 |  it's right close to the edge of the box and Harry Kane thought it was inside of
[2601.44 - 2606.36] P:1727.89 E:0.314065 |  the VAR will check and the challenger Saar making his way forward Sterling
[2606.36 - 2610.12] P:1644.69 E:0.324381 |  inflicted past him and challenger Saar knew exactly what he was doing in
[2610.12 - 2614.20] P:1675.33 E:0.367409 |  leaving a left arm in there the ball hit it and the free kick is for a handball
[2614.20 - 2620.20] P:1653.42 E:0.346690 |  about a yard and a half outside the box and this is a very promising position
[2620.20 - 2625.60] P:1583.12 E:0.340968 |  so made the point there the back line have got a tech responsibility in the
[2625.60 - 2629.60] P:1507.72 E:0.334299 |  goalkeeper of getting on the ball a little bit quicker than they have looking
[2629.60 - 2634.08] P:1521.77 E:0.316271 |  to feed the ball into midfield quicker than they have and on that occasion
[2634.80 - 2639.48] P:1540.27 E:0.360145 |  means this played a ball which I think is almost played a ball to get shut down
[2639.48 - 2644.84] P:1434.54 E:0.352764 |  not a cultured pass and it still caused a problem because of Sterling's ability
[2644.84 - 2649.72] P:1502.76 E:0.353022 |  and speed well this is a really good area favours the right-footed shot
[2649.72 - 2656.08] P:1517.15 E:0.336785 |  mounts and shippier and Sterling are the three England players in attendance but
[2656.08 - 2661.36] P:1590.01 E:0.372180 |  Sterling is very much the outside of the three and he vacates the scene already
[2661.84 - 2668.72] P:1565.03 E:0.344255 |  England have lined up a little two-man wall to the right of a five-man
[2668.72 - 2674.88] P:1663.95 E:0.348399 |  Croatian wall haven't got the old draft excluder in behind the wall oh they
[2674.88 - 2680.00] P:1726.56 E:0.334371 |  have that just putting him down so one line behind a four-man wall it's Kieran
[2680.00 - 2684.28] P:1813.53 E:0.325893 |  Shrippier who's scored from this kind of area against Croatia in the past tries to
[2684.28 - 2690.08] P:1589.42 E:0.346740 |  do so again the wall jumped blocked it goes out of play fourth right yeah hit it
[2690.20 - 2694.40] P:1643.65 E:0.344888 |  good pice but Perisic I think it was managed to get his head to his a good

[2765.60 - 2769.80] P:1226.57 E:0.309956 |  quicker but but don't be panicking about being pressurized I don't think
[2769.80 - 2772.24] P:1366.40 E:0.325708 |  Croatians are pressurized in particularly well

[2821.24 - 2826.04] P:1358.98 E:0.326586 |  forward but what we do defensively and I've seen nothing in this first off to

[2860.64 - 2864.76] P:1597.11 E:0.329157 |  been a solid start to the tournament no breakthrough though England in Croatia
[2864.76 - 2868.92] P:1634.04 E:0.350432 |  in the hard time the one thing I will say and you're absolutely right sacks of

[2872.24 - 2876.28] P:1720.11 E:0.357026 |  the end of the game and they've certainly seen England start tournaments much worse
[2876.28 - 2881.04] P:1456.51 E:0.309085 |  than they've started this one it's gonna be Croatia get the second half on the way
[2881.04 - 2886.72] P:1589.52 E:0.319587 |  in the all black hit they're kicking from the right to left defending what
[2886.72 - 2892.00] P:1508.29 E:0.347217 |  used to be the the tunnel end of the old stadium and then all white it's

[2927.64 - 2931.68] P:1501.91 E:0.280585 |  there was enough loop on it that you had time to think about it he took a couple
[2931.68 - 2935.92] P:1618.72 E:0.311779 |  of hasty steps back and made a catch but slightly nerdy start to the second half
[2935.92 - 2939.12] P:1660.95 E:0.327063 |  Paris is just trying to take on John Stones for pace we didn't see that at
[2939.12 - 2942.92] P:1394.83 E:0.321923 |  all in the first no we didn't as I said John Stones dealt with him pretty well
[2942.92 - 2949.44] P:1396.19 E:0.324431 |  rolled it back into to mings and mings cannon these clearance straight into
[2949.88 - 2954.12] P:1322.66 E:0.335122 |  the creation player who looked at the ball just looked and pick for dealt with it
[2954.12 - 2959.20] P:1344.12 E:0.312200 |  I just want to sort of I spoke with Gareth a couple of days after I think it
[2959.20 - 2962.60] P:1454.54 E:0.360036 |  was our internationals in March and then we talked there was a clamour about
[2962.60 - 2966.56] P:1475.60 E:0.333309 |  making a substitution to get a goal at the time I can't remember which game it
[2966.56 - 2972.16] P:1337.34 E:0.318020 |  was and we sort of spoke with each other and he talked about it wasn't a case of
[2972.16 - 2976.12] P:1220.34 E:0.337463 |  bringing someone on it was a case of which one of them do I take off because
[2976.16 - 2979.60] P:1348.10 E:0.348757 |  they're all doing quite well and that's a fair point that you made there and I
[2979.60 - 2984.00] P:1433.90 E:0.325853 |  think it's worth sort of just mentioning now sometimes we've got great options
[2984.00 - 2987.96] P:1427.71 E:0.352039 |  from the bench if someone said to me now which one of the front four do I take
[2987.96 - 2992.32] P:1403.97 E:0.312331 |  off I need a goal it will be a difficult judgment call I think challenge
[2992.32 - 2996.16] P:1803.98 E:0.355626 |  aside finding perisic on the Croatian left-hand side of the offside flag is up
[2996.16 - 2999.96] P:1598.71 E:0.333233 |  it's a pretty good which it's taken by England who have pick for the goal

[3015.24 - 3020.12] P:1571.43 E:0.352626 |  teenage who's making his first star for his country quality old Rosovitch anchors
[3020.12 - 3023.88] P:1535.93 E:0.348437 |  that midfield for them Kramaric on the right moderate to cover stitch
[3023.88 - 3030.28] P:1525.61 E:0.348212 |  perisic on the left and anti-revic leads the line means put under pressure by
[3030.32 - 3035.12] P:1503.58 E:0.355064 |  Rebic is it back for his goalkeeper pick for the term to play out from the
[3035.12 - 3040.36] P:1661.55 E:0.342744 |  back John Stones can do that now just easy for Kane comes to meet it are the
[3040.36 - 3044.88] P:1807.07 E:0.374845 |  old who's shown maturity beyond his years and experience was in there and a
[3044.88 - 3048.52] P:1736.55 E:0.351632 |  very poor challenge which is rewarded with a yellow card coverage it's on
[3048.52 - 3054.80] P:1542.35 E:0.333153 |  Foden nice and free kick to England just on the exit of center circle Mason
[3054.80 - 3058.96] P:1483.76 E:0.326828 |  matter beg your pardon the player that was caught there just took the ball
[3058.96 - 3067.24] P:1372.54 E:0.244955 |  was it and coverage it slid in from a long way out a little bit of the ball
[3067.24 - 3070.68] P:1500.85 E:0.351570 |  but it's clearly out of control any yellow car for Mateo coverage for a
[3070.68 - 3074.92] P:1534.66 E:0.344244 |  foul on his club team yeah we'll probably deny the fact he was out of
[3074.92 - 3079.12] P:1573.95 E:0.343131 |  control there what he's done was keep his feet in he's not extended to make the
[3079.12 - 3082.88] P:1546.32 E:0.326128 |  challenge because I think if he did he could have been in red country world in
[3082.92 - 3087.44] P:1573.42 E:0.304124 |  red card world but he done quite well we in some respects kept his feet tucked
[3087.44 - 3091.44] P:1344.18 E:0.332969 |  in probably deserved a yellow card but certainly not red
[3091.44 - 3096.76] P:1417.48 E:0.366002 |  man's okay he's back on his feet nice a free kick which will be taken by Declan Rice
[3096.76 - 3102.44] P:1373.12 E:0.370493 |  back for mings and Mason will work it for down the England left-hand side for Sterling

[3107.28 - 3111.76] P:1490.83 E:0.354717 |  angles right tribute making his way forward from left back which we nice
[3111.80 - 3115.60] P:1657.85 E:0.363315 |  sporadically in the first half Croatian will try and utilize that space
[3115.60 - 3120.32] P:1664.03 E:0.350619 |  those they work it for links slides in there's enough to deviate the ball away
[3120.32 - 3123.60] P:1686.21 E:0.340941 |  from the path of red it's and then stones will come across the play down by
[3123.60 - 3128.08] P:1551.33 E:0.361259 |  the corner flag but that's given possession away to throw to Croatia
[3128.08 - 3132.12] P:1459.90 E:0.334787 |  right down by that quarterfinal just wait if it should be the push forward and
[3132.12 - 3136.08] P:1375.83 E:0.347067 |  hit the space in behind it yeah in the second half we've had a couple of balls
[3136.12 - 3142.56] P:1419.79 E:0.358356 |  just into the channel area it's extended both stones and means manage just clear
[3142.56 - 3146.60] P:1269.07 E:0.334710 |  things up reasonably comfortably
[3147.52 - 3150.32] P:1527.26 E:0.347483 |  on the Croatian right little back here flick from
[3150.32 - 3154.24] P:1700.52 E:0.356673 |  Luka Modric but all that's inside the box is fallen away by Tyrone mings Kane
[3154.24 - 3158.00] P:1558.02 E:0.349262 |  chasing after it try to make something happen feed are able to guard it back
[3158.00 - 3162.16] P:1624.37 E:0.348113 |  for Chalaza Sar Kane then chases the back pass to the
[3162.20 - 3167.00] P:1439.37 E:0.333070 |  back of it you know he was very much second favorite and then the back of
[3167.00 - 3170.76] P:1760.48 E:0.329327 |  it's the tribute tribute of the back had a just didn't see Revis Pigford's come
[3170.76 - 3177.76] P:1552.71 E:0.341481 |  out swags up and gone away I was hearing tribute just assuming that there was no
[3177.76 - 3182.44] P:1584.83 E:0.350715 |  one there and he turned the back had a back to his goalkeeper and he read his
[3182.44 - 3186.92] P:1625.91 E:0.338884 |  eyes lit up for a moment but pick for very sharp good anticipation off his line
[3186.96 - 3191.00] P:1537.85 E:0.349365 |  should be a extends a hand of apology no harm done but it's a close one thing
[3191.00 - 3197.36] P:1515.35 E:0.355231 |  yeah there's a say Revis was was alert to it made a really good dot in run to try
[3197.36 - 3201.96] P:1307.53 E:0.362748 |  and get on the end of it and fortunately for England pick for got there
[3201.96 - 3205.24] P:1322.54 E:0.379096 |  slightly ahead of him otherwise I think the way committed himself we'd have had

[3227.08 - 3230.68] P:1531.71 E:0.365914 |  left back in six of his last ten internationalists for England now despite
[3230.68 - 3237.72] P:1378.27 E:0.346568 |  the fact that he is a right back by trade Rice out for Stones
[3237.76 - 3242.96] P:1528.27 E:0.380435 |  who's counters in the 40s and bring it forward and find Harry Kane dropping off

[3259.36 - 3263.96] P:1375.18 E:0.361872 |  fouled just got caught in the center circle and it's a free kick which would
[3263.96 - 3269.08] P:1350.34 E:0.371375 |  be taken very quickly back on his feet and the veteran Croatian captain will
[3269.08 - 3273.20] P:1392.02 E:0.379361 |  bring it forward it's no no on Talksport a feature of Harry Kane's game
[3273.20 - 3278.20] P:1393.45 E:0.378310 |  certainly over the last season or two has been dropping deep and towing things
[3278.20 - 3282.88] P:1405.27 E:0.365490 |  together and I'm not sure today whether he's been asked to stay for up the pitch
[3282.88 - 3287.52] P:1318.70 E:0.376919 |  or not but he probably needs to start doing that a bit more regularly dropping
[3287.52 - 3291.68] P:1294.08 E:0.366436 |  in and playing together just to break the momentum of the game up a little bit

[3401.84 - 3407.12] P:1351.77 E:0.370762 |  see Harry Kane just stand up top but for the sake of this game I think you might
[3407.12 - 3410.72] P:1408.32 E:0.366165 |  need to just drop off a little bit and maybe let the lights and mount and

[3490.84 - 3494.68] P:1575.16 E:0.377782 |  terraces ten minutes into the second half those the thoughts of Stuart Pierce

[3538.56 - 3544.24] P:1348.92 E:0.315009 |  and there so you gotta step it up laser back for Phillips quickly the meetings

[3555.84 - 3558.92] P:1683.12 E:0.357341 |  headway now Calvin Phillips will try and make a run to split the lines and he's
[3558.92 - 3562.04] P:1783.59 E:0.351810 |  not well he receives the ball and he turns inside slips it in he's

[3579.92 - 3584.92] P:1612.81 E:0.362954 |  his potential critics and excellent England move Sterling with the sharpness

[3602.40 - 3606.92] P:1642.50 E:0.336833 |  ran him behind there was no doubt he was gonna finish really good run by Sterling
[3606.92 - 3611.68] P:1665.06 E:0.299143 |  acres of space and they're under big pressure when they get asked questions
[3611.68 - 3618.00] P:1540.09 E:0.298583 |  physically the quickness of our front line causes them a big problem fantastic

[3636.72 - 3641.12] P:1701.51 E:0.352415 |  contribution from it yeah it was the good thing is we were patient at the back
[3641.12 - 3646.56] P:1754.26 E:0.314420 |  but we did we waited for the time to play that pass it was a 30-yard ball
[3646.56 - 3650.68] P:1696.01 E:0.312350 |  straight through their lines and it was a wonderful run by Phillips that created
[3650.68 - 3655.60] P:1521.61 E:0.316635 |  all the problems and all the panic in the back line of Croatia but England have
[3655.92 - 3660.88] P:1517.45 E:0.342617 |  the lead against Croatia before bottom line is just gonna be able to hold on to

[3717.64 - 3722.80] P:1405.20 E:0.363976 |  with the format of the tournament only eight teams get eliminated in the group
[3722.80 - 3730.32] P:1378.43 E:0.363166 |  stage if you win any game then you're through just about here's John Slantz

[3758.56 - 3764.08] P:1340.90 E:0.391522 |  good patience now and you can hear the intensity of the support the volume is
[3764.08 - 3771.04] P:1297.39 E:0.374002 |  there lifted the England fans lifted by that genuine quality that we've seen in
[3771.04 - 3778.36] P:1250.45 E:0.375657 |  the game back he goes for Rice 59 minutes gone Stones
[3779.96 - 3785.20] P:1421.43 E:0.394259 |  Stones down for Calvin Phillips Stones just working in the feet of Harry Kane so he was

[3789.52 - 3793.20] P:1464.09 E:0.371725 |  waiting for Kane to get back to his feet then plays it into his captain Kane with a
[3793.92 - 3798.00] P:1551.96 E:0.387252 |  good turn Bosvich comes forward and it was one nibble at the ankles to Manny
[3798.00 - 3802.14] P:1503.05 E:0.382846 |  to bring the free kick being no hurry to take it so Campbell your thoughts on that
[3802.14 - 3804.64] P:1277.91 E:0.367756 |  England got
[3806.92 - 3813.48] P:1335.95 E:0.365083 |  now play for again towards the edge of the penalty area by England

[3831.00 - 3835.44] P:1733.77 E:0.344818 |  outlifting side of the air it's Kane always missed it sliding in far post and he
[3835.44 - 3839.84] P:1778.73 E:0.328771 |  said himself as well potentially colliding with the post and Levakovich the
[3839.84 - 3844.84] P:1766.51 E:0.313448 |  Croatian goalkeepers very concerned so ball across the six-yard box Kane was
[3844.84 - 3850.04] P:1755.72 E:0.300297 |  right by the post as he slid in couldn't get the contact he needed to double
[3850.08 - 3855.04] P:1685.84 E:0.320758 |  England's lead but his momentum has taken him straight into the post it might be
[3855.04 - 3859.60] P:1583.80 E:0.310550 |  his left shoulder that has borne the brunt of that or potentially even the
[3859.60 - 3865.60] P:1468.43 E:0.318381 |  side of his head that was the last one yeah I think it's his left shoulder he's
[3865.60 - 3870.28] P:1444.57 E:0.339552 |  just gone past the goalkeeper shoulder stroke ribs but it's got to say
[3870.28 - 3874.48] P:1400.19 E:0.353384 |  wonderful ball in and for all intents and purposes you felt as though Harry
[3874.48 - 3879.12] P:1578.68 E:0.356088 |  Kane was going to score there he doesn't often miss and he's just stretching too
[3879.16 - 3884.08] P:1403.11 E:0.350019 |  much and got over the top of it once again good play by England took the
[3884.08 - 3888.84] P:1406.64 E:0.339638 |  chance played forward passes got turned and eventually got the effort of the
[3888.84 - 3894.28] P:1259.11 E:0.353947 |  far post I still down receiving treatment away to our right-hand side so
[3894.28 - 3897.68] P:1453.69 E:0.342220 |  what are your thoughts on what we've seen over the last four five minutes of
[3897.68 - 3901.48] P:1332.27 E:0.373074 |  Harry Kane incident but also the goal the procedure what a change really for
[3901.48 - 3906.96] P:1338.06 E:0.317628 |  me to make what a goal does to the team and you know just pushing them and
[3907.00 - 3910.76] P:1285.18 E:0.349696 |  probing and getting into you know breaking those lines and getting in
[3910.76 - 3915.44] P:1385.61 E:0.321344 |  those good positions a great great ball behind the sterling sticks it away
[3915.44 - 3918.40] P:1421.77 E:0.316718 |  that's what you want and the confidence is his office is coming back and the
[3918.40 - 3923.20] P:1665.53 E:0.323813 |  shame about you know came confident you know just just a minute ago but the
[3923.20 - 3926.44] P:1623.55 E:0.349269 |  confidence is flying now and that will do the world a good for the teams
[3926.44 - 3929.80] P:1685.22 E:0.350075 |  especially the young players to settle them down as well while the world the
[3929.80 - 3932.48] P:1926.71 E:0.373287 |  first world you heard was Harry getting getting back to his feet and the
[3932.52 - 3937.92] P:1718.95 E:0.354041 |  second as he almost squinted down towards the corner flag to get behind the
[3937.92 - 3943.40] P:1532.74 E:0.312469 |  touch line so that he could come back on his been waved on he's okay and
[3943.40 - 3946.76] P:1414.56 E:0.359030 |  England are as well at the moment leading by a golden ill with the Raheem

[3961.44 - 3966.12] P:1478.39 E:0.360314 |  think Jim it's important that we understand how to play now we've taken
[3966.12 - 3970.76] P:1625.25 E:0.345970 |  the lead don't just slow it down for slow it down sake hopefully Croatia will
[3970.76 - 3974.40] P:1514.38 E:0.345027 |  come on to us a little bit and create space but we've still got a push forward
[3974.40 - 3977.88] P:1504.08 E:0.317934 |  and almost take a leaf out the Italians books from the other night they've
[3977.88 - 3981.96] P:1455.93 E:0.339108 |  scored one they've scored two and still they kept coming forward it is almost
[3981.96 - 3988.80] P:1443.75 E:0.377130 |  the best means of defense as a naughty one from Foden who just make contact with
[3988.80 - 3993.76] P:1579.77 E:0.365183 |  the back of the olds here gets a yellow card is fun
[3996.44 - 4000.24] P:1514.45 E:0.372899 |  played the advantage to start with because Croatia still have the ball but
[4000.24 - 4004.04] P:1471.10 E:0.350255 |  party all riding around in pain and so he stopped it so we can see if any
[4004.04 - 4008.92] P:1453.58 E:0.322604 |  treatment is necessary but Foden in the book actually just that's calling on the
[4008.92 - 4012.80] P:1480.20 E:0.342539 |  top of the foot rather than the Achilles so phone and put
[4013.80 - 4020.96] P:1464.73 E:0.356562 |  leading by a golden hill we've played 63 minutes on the talk sport it's it

[4026.28 - 4029.88] P:1536.43 E:0.334917 |  much for what you've done but for the reaction of your opponent nothing
[4029.88 - 4035.20] P:1529.99 E:0.353287 |  that's what folding what book for there is starting with a little drop of the

[4040.28 - 4044.48] P:1443.35 E:0.386055 |  referee said he was nothing more than a genuine coming together between the two

[4063.44 - 4069.40] P:1562.61 E:0.321575 |  get all you need when you need it at trade point England needed to lead and
[4069.44 - 4073.28] P:1631.32 E:0.321541 |  they've got it Modric work wide out towards the right hand side for salad
[4073.28 - 4077.00] P:1765.89 E:0.341745 |  goes ball in it's coverage it's your crowd it plays not to a another shot
[4077.00 - 4081.56] P:1670.35 E:0.358949 |  through a crowd of players from Rebic just drag wide that was a half chance
[4081.56 - 4085.92] P:1653.70 E:0.331121 |  yeah it was pinball in the box there ball bouncing around and was Rebic it
[4085.92 - 4091.00] P:1627.91 E:0.337663 |  come out to eventually on the edge of the box and our hearts were in our mouth
[4091.00 - 4099.20] P:1563.25 E:0.351251 |  and he just pulled it wide if the if the score stays 1-0 you know full
[4099.36 - 4103.08] P:1472.84 E:0.373534 |  between now and the end of the game there'll be one or two nervous moments
[4103.08 - 4107.16] P:1445.30 E:0.356185 |  and we've got to make sure that we don't add to that we've got to make sure what
[4107.16 - 4111.84] P:1349.50 E:0.338373 |  we do puts them on the back for best way of doing that get a second you made
[4111.84 - 4118.68] P:1332.25 E:0.357358 |  about the Italians the things very significant because they were really
[4118.68 - 4121.56] P:1749.39 E:0.374541 |  going after Turkey in that game England might be able to do something similar
[4121.56 - 4124.96] P:1775.89 E:0.336853 |  now because man can bring it forward and Mounties goal side he just tried to
[4125.28 - 4129.16] P:1700.81 E:0.348686 |  towards can he was brought down and it's a free kick to England five yards
[4129.16 - 4133.60] P:1754.76 E:0.344332 |  outside the box and another yellow car this time for Marcelo Brosevich
[4133.60 - 4137.56] P:1633.16 E:0.354510 |  absolutely surprises that it's taken any three quarters of the game before he's
[4137.56 - 4141.68] P:1481.99 E:0.367329 |  got his first one of the tournament Brosevich's the third relation player to
[4141.68 - 4146.52] P:1499.46 E:0.332349 |  have his name taken but in fact it's probably a good free kick to give away
[4146.52 - 4149.84] P:1665.34 E:0.353631 |  because Mount was making good progress and he had came in space to his right
[4149.84 - 4154.04] P:1347.99 E:0.331162 |  and Brosevich did everything he could to make sure that Mount couldn't play the
[4154.08 - 4160.60] P:1402.06 E:0.350053 |  pass. Whenever we've got in situations like that when there's been a one-on-one
[4160.60 - 4165.08] P:1346.32 E:0.355209 |  player being exposed the Croatians are fine being found wanting that they've
[4165.08 - 4169.64] P:1276.50 E:0.373395 |  got the energy or the legs to be fair dealing with the likes of Mount Fogun
[4169.64 - 4174.16] P:1290.17 E:0.359076 |  and Sterling when you come in at the tournament they are a handful to defend against.
[4176.16 - 4181.76] P:1543.11 E:0.357660 |  So Proletia lining up this defensive wall of Akavic just cramps down he's got his left shot
[4181.80 - 4189.48] P:1490.53 E:0.356610 |  against his post he's got five in the wall England of again station two in front of that wall
[4191.48 - 4195.92] P:1529.46 E:0.361842 |  it's gonna be Mason Mount to take it right foot in oh it was close over the bar but close
[4195.92 - 4200.76] P:1596.79 E:0.337747 |  and it just kissed the roof of the net on its way over and he had the Makulic
[4200.76 - 4205.28] P:1620.86 E:0.355378 |  straggling across his line very grateful just to see that the ball cleared his
[4205.28 - 4209.24] P:1423.32 E:0.342572 |  crossbar as a close run for him. Yeah I think he had it well covered he's gone
[4209.24 - 4215.24] P:1368.37 E:0.346240 |  goalkeeper's side but it just didn't get the dip early enough. Got a new though.
[4215.24 - 4220.84] P:1206.20 E:0.333868 |  You've got a new Aladar but not a second goal for England.
[4220.84 - 4224.48] P:1333.93 E:0.371968 |  The middle way through this second half. With Torxport those are the thoughts of
[4224.48 - 4229.12] P:1466.87 E:0.372986 |  for Sturepears England leading Croatia. By a golden elm next in action against
[4229.12 - 4234.80] P:1268.66 E:0.370030 |  Scotland here and eight o'clock kickoff Friday night and that's life you want
[4234.84 - 4241.60] P:1387.88 E:0.340942 |  Torxport and Torxport two. If you want the Scottish angle to the commentary
[4241.60 - 4247.16] P:1247.56 E:0.360649 |  Torxport two is your place to go and if you're an England fan then it's here on
[4247.16 - 4252.44] P:1477.40 E:0.362183 |  Torxport that we'll be talking through the action. The Akavic goalkeeper lays out from the back
[4252.44 - 4256.24] P:1687.68 E:0.375880 |  good pressing from Mount he's gonna be unrewarded but it's just played out towards
[4256.24 - 4261.20] P:1800.19 E:0.359616 |  Broznic and Mount head after him and closed him down. Now they are just showing those
[4261.60 - 4267.76] P:1518.12 E:0.358417 |  seeds of doubt in the Croatians as the men in black shirts have possession and
[4267.76 - 4272.48] P:1411.09 E:0.366501 |  Croatia I think are going to be the first to bring the changes. Change is going to be
[4272.48 - 4277.68] P:1513.68 E:0.349322 |  made over on the far touch line and it's Vlasic who will come on and
[4277.68 - 4284.16] P:1364.11 E:0.352445 |  Vlacalo as well. So Vlasic who never really showed ever some fans exactly what he was
[4284.16 - 4288.04] P:1425.46 E:0.344452 |  about but he's had a very good career since leaving Goodison Park and you know
[4288.04 - 4294.36] P:1272.50 E:0.316757 |  as at Bregalo will be on as well. Croatia in possession. I think we've got
[4294.36 - 4299.88] P:1384.69 E:0.345330 |  Rashford coming on as well for England. Kibben. They're just able to play it forward.
[4299.88 - 4306.20] P:1360.80 E:0.359739 |  Goes out to the Croatian left and an opportunity for Fulbac to make his way
[4306.20 - 4310.40] P:1562.54 E:0.372614 |  who's that hit last. Walkie yes. It's out of play for a Croatian. Let's join the
[4310.40 - 4312.72] P:1541.80 E:0.329945 |  Torxport England goalie Faker others.
[4313.68 - 4318.24] P:1581.33 E:0.384121 |  Faker Fane. They will have all the reaction. It's been the Garas Southgate and the
[4318.24 - 4323.12] P:1543.35 E:0.373800 |  head line makers at the end of this game. It's been four and five here on Torxport.
[4324.16 - 4329.28] P:1565.08 E:0.361585 |  Will it be an England team celebrating at the moment so far so good. One little England
[4329.28 - 4333.04] P:1675.44 E:0.344915 |  in comes this Croatia corner from Modric towards the edge of the air. Right foot in
[4333.04 - 4337.60] P:1719.50 E:0.353532 |  Vali. Drag wide again. Well they just worked the one back towards the edge of the box.
[4337.60 - 4342.16] P:1719.12 E:0.340164 |  Brozovic ran onto it but pulled it wide and that's going to be his last kick
[4342.16 - 4345.92] P:1659.96 E:0.360231 |  because he's going to be replaced now by the more attack mighty Nicola Vlasic who
[4346.56 - 4352.88] P:1603.84 E:0.378722 |  scored at home to Sweden and France in the Nations League. 12 goals for CSKA Moscow this
[4352.88 - 4359.20] P:1544.09 E:0.360750 |  season so he will come on and Josip Perekulo. Kelo has a right winger against Slovenia but
[4359.20 - 4366.88] P:1307.09 E:0.394309 |  ordinarily plays as a 10. He's the other man that is going to be coming on here for Croatians
[4367.36 - 4374.16] P:1445.65 E:0.383661 |  and will make their change at this juncture as well. Looks that way. Kramaric is the man
[4374.16 - 4379.36] P:1429.88 E:0.383616 |  that Perekulo has replaced and sure enough it is Phil Foden who hit the inside of the post
[4379.36 - 4385.28] P:1539.51 E:0.372384 |  early on and he will make way here for Marcus Rashford. So to Jason for Croatia one for England.
[4385.28 - 4390.96] P:1671.45 E:0.373531 |  Should be. Yeah I think Rashford will play on the left potentially Sterling who will slide across.
[4391.92 - 4396.64] P:1588.83 E:0.396505 |  That's what he's doing there. So Rashford's coming from the right hand side.
[4399.28 - 4405.76] P:1764.21 E:0.380445 |  So Marcus Rashford makes his way on. Big ovation for it. England leading by Goldemir. Rashford
[4405.76 - 4412.24] P:1625.86 E:0.360877 |  is scoring five of his last six games including the winner against Romania last time out.
[4413.68 - 4419.44] P:1416.91 E:0.380327 |  One more England lead. I think if you're a Croatian defender and you're a little bit worried about
[4419.44 - 4425.60] P:1465.51 E:0.357953 |  the pace all of a sudden seeing Rashford coming off the bench on 70 or 70 minutes is a major
[4425.60 - 4432.72] P:1274.18 E:0.351185 |  concern for them. Salika playing here forward. Mings is there and knocking away for England.
[4432.72 - 4440.56] P:1362.81 E:0.324949 |  Goes into the feet of Sterling. England just mopping up very niggly entirely. Working back
[4440.56 - 4445.84] P:1550.93 E:0.358959 |  for Mings. Mings dropping his shoulder turning inside the box. Gets it away from Revis. Troupier
[4446.40 - 4450.32] P:1602.65 E:0.370684 |  into the midfield for Rice. Kane drops off. It's a lovely ball.
[4450.88 - 4455.60] P:1706.34 E:0.360186 |  Flick forward scooped the outside of the right boots. Joss got over the fire touch line and
[4455.60 - 4461.20] P:1327.03 E:0.345519 |  had a play for a throw. It's one of the best attempts of Mason now. It was an excellent piece of play.
[4461.20 - 4466.08] P:1454.39 E:0.324906 |  Assault Campbell, part of our commentary team as well. That was so much tournament experience
[4466.08 - 4469.28] P:1622.00 E:0.348340 |  playing for England. So what are your thoughts on that change? Rashford for Fogholtz?
[4469.28 - 4473.84] P:1389.65 E:0.308913 |  Well it's a great change really. I know Fodos are running south into the ground
[4473.84 - 4480.64] P:1205.91 E:0.306967 |  and you've got Rashford coming on. Pace, Skill and I for goal. The creations of the
[4480.64 - 4485.36] P:1175.05 E:0.337127 |  definitely going to be worrying about him getting on the ball in one-on-ones scenarios
[4485.36 - 4492.48] P:1371.35 E:0.315615 |  in the last third. So great substitution. Vlasic slaying the ball off. Brekolo
[4493.12 - 4497.60] P:1508.94 E:0.369086 |  play forward to Vlasic again wearing 13. The former Everton man chipped in left footed.
[4497.60 - 4501.68] P:1637.43 E:0.362013 |  Perisic going up for it inside the penalty area. Walk down well though by Walker.
[4501.68 - 4507.36] P:1591.80 E:0.347509 |  He headed it forward and now Rashford was scamper after it. Coming across Chalets-Assard just
[4508.00 - 4512.64] P:1543.79 E:0.340827 |  locked it away from Marcus Rashford's run. Has come off the bench as many times as he started
[4512.64 - 4518.08] P:1396.19 E:0.364325 |  for England in an international career which is now five years old Marcus Rashford.
[4520.16 - 4524.32] P:1420.90 E:0.366673 |  Croatia working it towards the edge of the England penalty area again with Kovacic
[4526.08 - 4530.16] P:1614.39 E:0.361454 |  sending it wide. Vlasic to the full back for Saliko. Vlasic has already seen plenty of it since
[4530.16 - 4534.24] P:1674.69 E:0.346742 |  coming on and Declan Rice is trying to stop the cross coming in. Now it is chipped inside the
[4534.24 - 4538.72] P:1810.89 E:0.353285 |  area. It should be an easy one for Walker just to shepherd it back to his goalkeeper. He knew
[4538.72 - 4543.76] P:1670.57 E:0.344508 |  that Perisic was coming in blind side of him but he just got his body in the way and Pickford could
[4543.76 - 4549.60] P:1641.60 E:0.334381 |  come out and claim it after a bounce inside the six yard box. And England lead Croatia 17 minutes
[4549.60 - 4554.48] P:1594.19 E:0.368073 |  ago here on Torch Sport. You know, gotta give Col Walker a lot of credit there. The ball bounced
[4554.48 - 4558.88] P:1683.77 E:0.365123 |  in the six yard box. What I hold is in my mouth. They dealt with it really well. Just shepherd
[4559.44 - 4567.12] P:1487.98 E:0.359485 |  it back to his goalkeeper. England 17 minutes away from getting off to a winning start in the
[4567.12 - 4573.52] P:1584.65 E:0.355912 |  Euros for the first time ever. Chalaza has attacked the balls gone right through the back of Harry
[4573.52 - 4578.56] P:1510.79 E:0.337443 |  K. He is already on a yellow card. Chalaza, that in itself got a yellow card offence but
[4580.08 - 4583.92] P:1425.37 E:0.359149 |  the next one might be in terms of persistent infringement. Kain gets up feeling the small of
[4583.92 - 4588.56] P:1449.53 E:0.329930 |  his back. He's okay. It's going to be an England free kick which will be taken about 15 yards
[4588.56 - 4596.48] P:1386.71 E:0.337977 |  inside Croatian territory. Some continues to shine. Just a little bit of white wispy cloud
[4597.68 - 4603.28] P:1438.20 E:0.323719 |  in the arch as we look up at it over on the top of the roof on the far touch line of this
[4603.28 - 4609.12] P:1443.94 E:0.329032 |  magnificent stadium. The atmosphere with the supporters in here today and the last majority
[4609.12 - 4614.56] P:1552.73 E:0.338901 |  delighted with what they're seeing. Mings, it's not even down for Sterling. And he couldn't get
[4614.56 - 4620.16] P:1603.24 E:0.338906 |  underneath it. There's a free attempt. He's only about 11-12 yards down. Maybe had time to take a
[4620.16 - 4624.64] P:1680.26 E:0.330881 |  touch and do something more constructive with it. It's just a straight free kick punted forward.
[4624.64 - 4629.84] P:1623.74 E:0.329849 |  Mings heading it back down and Sterling had a lot more time than he thought. Went for goal
[4629.84 - 4634.80] P:1774.19 E:0.328024 |  immediately and missed the target by a distance. Mings' set up play there. Fantastic. Headed it
[4634.80 - 4640.48] P:1659.02 E:0.357079 |  back and it's probably the Achilles heel over. He should have done so much better there. It was
[4640.48 - 4645.20] P:1493.48 E:0.340649 |  a really poor effort. It's just a wild swing at the goal. Skyed it like the one he did earlier in
[4645.20 - 4652.24] P:1422.44 E:0.336232 |  the first half. Now England have got a problem with John Stones who is down injured inside the
[4652.24 - 4660.32] P:1326.22 E:0.334229 |  centre circle. It's just that sitting down, an obvious concern. Now with Harry Maguire already
[4660.32 - 4667.52] P:1416.36 E:0.326827 |  out. If England were to lose their other first choice centre half, then the potential ramifications
[4667.52 - 4673.84] P:1506.91 E:0.339348 |  will be obvious. He's sitting down just stretching the toes of both boots towards him. Yeah, I think
[4673.84 - 4678.56] P:1430.65 E:0.335422 |  he's, well I don't know if it is cramp or not. But when he first went down I thought it was cramp.
[4678.56 - 4684.40] P:1464.71 E:0.354190 |  But I'm not so sure he would have got back to the centre circle and gone down again with cramp.
[4684.40 - 4689.60] P:1282.04 E:0.344334 |  I think it's probably something to touch more than that. Ben White's been set out to warm up.
[4691.28 - 4695.20] P:1388.40 E:0.360523 |  Wight and Mings not to set the half part. As you can see with Moe's disrespect at all that
[4695.20 - 4701.44] P:1425.42 E:0.334604 |  Garry Southgate would have been expecting to field at any stage of a match in a major tournament
[4701.44 - 4707.84] P:1587.63 E:0.320199 |  even probably six weeks ago. But Stones is back on his feet which is good to see and he's not making
[4707.84 - 4713.20] P:1630.31 E:0.360440 |  his way towards the fire touch line. He's making his way towards this near one which suggests that
[4713.20 - 4718.24] P:1417.42 E:0.354003 |  he is going to be able to continue. That's a very heartening sign as far as England support is
[4718.24 - 4722.56] P:1393.06 E:0.385044 |  concerned. I think it was a blow on his knee by the looks of it. No way they were flexing his knee.
[4723.52 - 4728.80] P:1512.56 E:0.369414 |  But hopefully it will be okay but sometimes going off and coming back on the pitch doesn't mean
[4728.80 - 4736.00] P:1250.96 E:0.372782 |  that they can continue. Just taking a little bit of fluid on board. Philips put the ball out of
[4736.00 - 4741.76] P:1571.47 E:0.351298 |  play so that Stones could receive the treatment that was necessary. Anker O'Asia restarted it with
[4741.76 - 4748.08] P:1469.55 E:0.329696 |  a throw that was taken by Perisic and Rebic. She chips it back out for an England throw.
[4748.16 - 4756.56] P:1402.77 E:0.350768 |  Carl Walker spinning the ball in his right hand a couple of times. Spacing a few seconds.
[4757.12 - 4762.48] P:1641.66 E:0.353759 |  Now Hales a long one down the touch line. Kane sandwiched in between the two of the Croatian
[4762.48 - 4770.08] P:1376.74 E:0.330048 |  defenders. Croatia winning the seconds and Philips is in there again. He really has had an excellent
[4771.04 - 4775.36] P:1392.30 E:0.282023 |  just this contribution for the goal. Vida played forward.
[4778.64 - 4784.48] P:1396.80 E:0.338013 |  Kovacic is working for over the halfway line. Goes into the Vida Vlasic back for Modric again.
[4785.44 - 4789.36] P:1325.88 E:0.377517 |  Kovacic covering a lot of ground. In and out towards the right hand side for his full back for
[4789.36 - 4796.00] P:1321.54 E:0.364558 |  Saliko. England won it up on Torxport only 13 minutes to go. Last on these two med at Wembley.
[4796.00 - 4802.72] P:1306.36 E:0.349228 |  Scythe was winning with 13 minutes to go. Lost. Here's Perisic play back towards Gvardian.
[4803.84 - 4810.16] P:1424.55 E:0.378719 |  Gvardian all back for Kovacic again. Now Luca Modric who so far England have been able to restrict
[4810.16 - 4815.68] P:1562.70 E:0.358085 |  Vida plays it for. Saliko again. England just dropping that little bit deeper.
[4816.56 - 4820.56] P:1622.38 E:0.371289 |  He'll sit back inside the penalty area along with the goalkeeper but as it's right down the
[4820.56 - 4824.24] P:1706.97 E:0.341332 |  touch line or it has taken a touch of an England man it's gone out for a throw which
[4824.24 - 4829.28] P:1585.84 E:0.351520 |  be taken by the Croatians. And Tram build again towards the edge of the penalty area. Nice turn
[4829.28 - 4833.76] P:1568.36 E:0.348201 |  by Rebic. They've got a man on the overlap. Low ball play in. Well read by Declan Rice.
[4834.32 - 4839.44] P:1647.94 E:0.328882 |  He took a touch with his right foot. Smashes it away with his left and puts it out of play for a
[4839.44 - 4845.92] P:1477.96 E:0.339944 |  throw and another change will be made on the Croatian bench over on the far touch line. This
[4845.92 - 4853.44] P:1501.03 E:0.320886 |  their third and it's the striker who's coming on. Petkovic who was left out of the starting
[4853.44 - 4858.40] P:1606.20 E:0.364884 |  line up today. He played against Belgium last week. Has scored these last six games since he
[4858.40 - 4865.28] P:1435.81 E:0.356650 |  headed against Portugal back in September. Has made 40 odd appearances in Serie A as a striker
[4865.28 - 4871.68] P:1636.78 E:0.361915 |  and has failed to score yet. But he's on now. Here's the Demos diagram man is replaced Rebic
[4871.68 - 4878.96] P:1449.77 E:0.317105 |  to strike swap up front. One little England 12 minutes ago on talk score. Yeah I'm just looking
[4879.04 - 4883.20] P:1373.58 E:0.360753 |  at the England bench and I'm not sure I've got quite a distance away here but I think it's
[4883.20 - 4890.32] P:1374.76 E:0.342297 |  Bellingham who's just been shouted to to go warm up. I think that is down there. So I've obviously
[4890.32 - 4895.28] P:1463.04 E:0.359362 |  got it in their mind to make things a bit more stable. It's important as well Croatia potentially
[4895.28 - 4900.72] P:1484.11 E:0.346574 |  will pin us back if we don't get the second goal. The lights are Rashford and certainly Stirling who
[4900.72 - 4905.04] P:1261.80 E:0.355905 |  does it more naturally just to drop in and offer that little bit of a barrier in front of their
[4905.04 - 4913.84] P:1388.93 E:0.336946 |  fallback. 11 to go. One little England. Pinkford takes the free kick and he said just send it right
[4913.84 - 4918.56] P:1520.75 E:0.336920 |  down the left hand touch like Stirling going up for it. Hike disadvantage against the man marking
[4918.56 - 4923.92] P:1446.07 E:0.336391 |  in Vesalico and he drifts over both of their heads and out of play for a throw to Croatia but
[4923.92 - 4929.52] P:1411.96 E:0.353800 |  midway inside their own half. Just about match management now. It was a long period whereas
[4929.52 - 4934.80] P:1391.93 E:0.342876 |  in England Fannie Muir has felt that one little England was a dangerous school line. I think back
[4934.80 - 4940.80] P:1395.06 E:0.359304 |  to the first game of Euro 2004 where England were a go up against France for a long long time and then
[4941.44 - 4948.64] P:1343.66 E:0.332430 |  proceeded twice to Zidane in stoppage time to end up getting beaten by two goals to one.
[4948.64 - 4952.64] P:1423.26 E:0.360591 |  Nobody's taking anything for granted yet but you'd rather be one that up than one that down at this
[4952.64 - 4958.40] P:1530.02 E:0.330060 |  stage. Rashford chipping it forward. Kane watching it over his shoulder. Well Chase after it might
[4958.40 - 4963.92] P:1493.53 E:0.338129 |  get there ahead of Vida. He didn't quite. Vida can just get his right foot to it working back to
[4963.92 - 4968.64] P:1503.78 E:0.354015 |  his goalkeeper. Novakovic plays out for Modric. Modric out to the right hand touch line.
[4969.76 - 4974.40] P:1338.79 E:0.367919 |  Over the final 10 minutes with the lead still intact. Vesalico.
[4978.32 - 4982.96] P:1555.85 E:0.375672 |  I'm sure we've had a little more purpose about them since they made the attacking changes. Prevolo
[4983.68 - 4989.60] P:1457.69 E:0.344948 |  is always lively. Just coming in off after right hand touch line having an important effect at the
[4989.60 - 4995.84] P:1487.03 E:0.352651 |  moment and Kramerich did. First opportunity for Peckovic. You will make his way forward now into
[4995.84 - 5000.24] P:1597.37 E:0.342925 |  a central position. An opportunity for the Croatians to give him something to attack.
[5000.24 - 5003.44] P:1554.99 E:0.358450 |  Prevolo is out there with Sterling. Sterling trying to prevent the cross.
[5004.64 - 5008.96] P:1532.94 E:0.356283 |  Prevolo ends up on the deck. Sterling ends up with a ball and takes a touch inside his own penalty
[5009.68 - 5014.00] P:1574.96 E:0.356743 |  area. As he gets it away he does actually find Croatian territory. Blowing because
[5014.00 - 5019.68] P:1508.11 E:0.348978 |  Salazar saw the ball run underneath his feet and he had to work his way back inside his own
[5019.68 - 5025.12] P:1643.40 E:0.373555 |  penalty area to rescue possession. Then there's his play for by Kovacic. He's missed his man
[5025.12 - 5032.64] P:1484.80 E:0.365163 |  Perisic by 20 yards and he goes out of play for a front. Nine minutes to go and Dubebelem just
[5032.64 - 5037.76] P:1556.21 E:0.387810 |  receives his final instructions for a go. So yeah I'm pleased to see this boy getting on. He's one
[5037.76 - 5044.16] P:1363.32 E:0.382061 |  tip by many in and around the game to have an impact at this tournament. You know that really
[5044.16 - 5049.76] P:1466.07 E:0.358220 |  good solid performance. We're in game management time now. Last nine minutes of the game plus a
[5049.76 - 5057.60] P:1461.55 E:0.373541 |  bit of added time. Sensibility, opportunity, account, and attack as well. Harry Kane is the player
[5058.16 - 5063.28] P:1626.44 E:0.353321 |  who's going to come off and Danielli Osada the referee is just saying he's got to leave by
[5063.28 - 5067.12] P:1621.26 E:0.354754 |  the nearest touch line. Kane's taking the captain's armband off and setting the referee. Well I've
[5067.12 - 5072.72] P:1529.69 E:0.365924 |  got to give this to somebody and the referee said don't worry about it. Kane gets a big ovation.
[5072.72 - 5078.96] P:1662.96 E:0.357001 |  There's a moment of history here for Dube Bellingham who becomes the youngest player ever to play out
[5078.96 - 5085.92] P:1591.56 E:0.364119 |  the Euros. The Dutchman Jettro Willems who was 10 weeks past his 18th birthday. Dube Bellingham
[5085.92 - 5092.96] P:1638.51 E:0.344818 |  just a fortnight short of his 18th birthday. So what for the might not last for long because
[5092.96 - 5097.20] P:1612.66 E:0.370028 |  Polish goalkeeper Kasper Koslowski could beat his record in this tournament.
[5098.32 - 5105.04] P:1574.07 E:0.358059 |  Dube Bellingham at 17 playing for England in the Euros. So it shows the trust that the manager has
[5105.04 - 5109.76] P:1411.96 E:0.357901 |  in this young man you know and the faith he has in him that he's prepared to put him on the pitch
[5109.76 - 5116.80] P:1626.69 E:0.350925 |  at this stage of a game. Also as well I quite enjoyed your little Dutch Steve McLaren type Jettro.
[5117.76 - 5118.80] P:1729.11 E:0.398421 |  Very good.
[5118.80 - 5121.44] P:1735.66 E:0.384746 |  Ball played on the top Rashford would chase it.
[5121.44 - 5124.16] P:1372.83 E:0.339247 |  And it goes all the way through to his goalkeeper.
[5124.16 - 5126.96] P:1463.83 E:0.373729 |  Oh I don't know what you're trying to say with that little observation.
[5126.96 - 5128.24] P:1460.16 E:0.349966 |  You cheek him up.
[5128.24 - 5130.40] P:1461.94 E:0.393082 |  Ball to play forward here.
[5130.40 - 5133.60] P:1584.95 E:0.349831 |  Ball to play it into the Park of Cobbichic.
[5133.60 - 5135.60] P:1571.78 E:0.366218 |  I think it was the left hand side.
[5135.60 - 5141.84] P:1567.38 E:0.350929 |  I think it's a really sensible substitution actually. We've got a threat of Rashford now down the middle.
[5141.84 - 5148.24] P:1468.55 E:0.348548 |  So if they come on to us and see Rashford's pace or get in there and Mount just filling this right
[5148.24 - 5152.80] P:1461.68 E:0.334138 |  hand side berth and we just look a little bit more secure defensively I think.
[5152.80 - 5156.96] P:1554.54 E:0.360886 |  So it is pretty much a 4-5-1 now. Mount on the right. Sterling still on the left hand side.
[5157.52 - 5161.60] P:1425.85 E:0.358020 |  And it's Phillips, Reiss and Bellingham in midfield three as we look at it.
[5161.60 - 5166.24] P:1699.30 E:0.369805 |  High ball inside. Pickford's penalty area is comfortably claimed at an over hit cross from
[5166.24 - 5171.04] P:1724.94 E:0.366842 |  Perisic. It's still good of course problems because it was not too far away from curling
[5171.12 - 5173.84] P:1644.87 E:0.364630 |  that top right hand corner. Pickford's handling is assured.
[5174.56 - 5178.00] P:1498.86 E:0.360476 |  An England's Sol Campbell are seven minutes away.
[5180.72 - 5184.88] P:1476.65 E:0.334784 |  You can't just position now. You just all about concentration.
[5184.88 - 5187.52] P:1343.44 E:0.386516 |  Keeping the ball. Don't do anything silly.
[5188.80 - 5191.60] P:1334.39 E:0.351909 |  And keep the ball moving and probe as well.
[5192.32 - 5196.00] P:1250.94 E:0.333235 |  If you can nick another one why not and calm all our nerves down.
[5196.00 - 5199.12] P:1294.39 E:0.329589 |  But now no silly mistakes. Keep it easy now.
[5201.28 - 5205.84] P:1540.65 E:0.375077 |  My memory goes back 25 years. We're in a similar position against the Swiss and some
[5205.84 - 5210.24] P:1167.54 E:0.351693 |  idiot called Pierce playing at the back give a penalty away. And it ended 1-1.
[5211.44 - 5215.36] P:1526.88 E:0.365759 |  But we've got much more intelligent players out there today than we had in those days.
[5216.64 - 5219.76] P:1223.11 E:0.376490 |  No turkey or master. Spore your afternoon today. Don't worry.
[5222.00 - 5226.40] P:1226.46 E:0.372852 |  One nil to England at the moment. You can remember it. How do you think the rest of us feel?
[5227.36 - 5230.56] P:1606.23 E:0.366195 |  The challenge coming in on him.
[5231.20 - 5235.44] P:1552.87 E:0.382960 |  The referee decides it's just a little bit too overzealous from Calvin Phillips.
[5236.40 - 5239.52] P:1583.39 E:0.386113 |  That's free kick to Croatia. Not in a shooting position at all.
[5239.52 - 5244.56] P:1486.53 E:0.361257 |  They're going to make another change before the free kick is taken.
[5247.36 - 5252.40] P:1454.22 E:0.374294 |  That's Povacic who's come off and it's going to be replaced by Pasilic.
[5253.12 - 5254.40] P:1496.57 E:0.399923 |  Over on the fire touch line.
[5254.40 - 5258.80] P:1518.66 E:0.397773 |  Maria Pasilic, the German born player who at an end aside from Chelsea.
[5259.76 - 5262.16] P:1536.90 E:0.389014 |  Played at all six of the nation's league games.
[5262.96 - 5266.40] P:1625.37 E:0.353040 |  And he'll come on fourth change for Croatia.
[5268.16 - 5270.80] P:1445.65 E:0.327061 |  Modric standing over this free kick.
[5270.80 - 5274.08] P:1609.49 E:0.336984 |  England shuffle away from the edge of the penalty area to keep a higher line.
[5274.08 - 5276.32] P:1769.26 E:0.351992 |  Free kick is over towards the right hand touch line.
[5276.88 - 5280.80] P:1586.04 E:0.338931 |  Modric addresses the ball just to see how far England are prepared to drop.
[5281.76 - 5284.96] P:1682.21 E:0.322110 |  Now he starts his run up again and he bends it in right footed
[5284.96 - 5285.76] P:2172.64 E:0.395377 |  in towards Celeto.
[5285.76 - 5288.16] P:1865.38 E:0.358565 |  Salve referee saw some pushing and shoving going on.
[5289.04 - 5290.72] P:1711.19 E:0.381075 |  That sweep the sound of that whistle.
[5290.72 - 5292.16] P:1715.13 E:0.358075 |  Free kick to England.
[5292.16 - 5293.20] P:1632.92 E:0.385231 |  Yeah they done well there.
[5293.20 - 5298.88] P:1612.20 E:0.358904 |  The England back line kept us as high as they possibly could for as long as they possibly could.
[5298.88 - 5305.52] P:1464.75 E:0.352319 |  And just I think it was either a foul or probably a slight offside I would suggest.
[5305.52 - 5309.60] P:1452.45 E:0.382503 |  Certainly Celeto's all was all over stunt.
[5310.80 - 5314.64] P:1598.44 E:0.384625 |  As long as they were actually to withstand the physical nature of that battle.
[5315.44 - 5316.72] P:1548.14 E:0.398831 |  And won it anyway.
[5317.44 - 5320.40] P:1621.42 E:0.392781 |  There will be a free kick which will be taken by England's Jordan Pitford.
[5320.40 - 5326.32] P:1400.38 E:0.385676 |  And the clock is ticking down into the 87th minute in a moment.
[5326.88 - 5327.92] P:1471.54 E:0.401929 |  England's still leading.
[5328.56 - 5331.92] P:1392.69 E:0.377638 |  Chelsea and that round he's sterling goal from half an hour ago.
[5331.92 - 5334.24] P:1478.55 E:0.363083 |  Is it going to be at the 10th time of asking?
[5335.28 - 5337.60] P:1392.63 E:0.405110 |  Victory in the first game of the Euros for England.
[5338.48 - 5340.48] P:1360.30 E:0.373337 |  Pitford sending the free kick forward.
[5340.48 - 5342.56] P:1523.53 E:0.376004 |  Has just flighted it straight out of play.
[5343.36 - 5345.44] P:1454.58 E:0.375952 |  The throw which will be taken on the Croatian right.
[5346.08 - 5347.84] P:1413.79 E:0.377249 |  The Salica has the ball in his hands.
[5348.80 - 5350.72] P:1414.72 E:0.372049 |  He works it forward over the half way line.
[5351.84 - 5356.96] P:1455.26 E:0.376300 |  Pashelic in the centre circle with the target of the pass which was a forthcoming.
[5356.96 - 5362.08] P:1554.10 E:0.352249 |  And Marcus Rashford then will chase as Croatia have to back pedal quickly.
[5362.08 - 5363.68] P:1507.44 E:0.358150 |  Celeto's start finding his goalkeeper.
[5363.68 - 5365.76] P:1409.50 E:0.344445 |  The back of it's out to the centre half again.
[5365.76 - 5367.52] P:1379.43 E:0.341162 |  And now out towards the full back for Salico.
[5368.56 - 5370.72] P:1465.43 E:0.379623 |  Celeto's start once more has the ball at his feet.
[5370.72 - 5371.92] P:1410.51 E:0.343100 |  Three and a half minutes to go.
[5372.64 - 5374.24] P:1482.10 E:0.365042 |  The stoppage time, there will be a little bit.
[5374.24 - 5377.12] P:1623.59 E:0.352372 |  Harry Kane went down, John Stone has gone down as well.
[5378.08 - 5382.64] P:1394.40 E:0.344536 |  Both able to continue after the respective collisions that they endured.
[5383.52 - 5384.64] P:1301.34 E:0.371837 |  So might be four minutes.
[5386.00 - 5391.84] P:1367.67 E:0.344338 |  Modric, obviously into the game so far as he's off of the way in the Champions League football.
[5391.92 - 5396.00] P:1571.90 E:0.360203 |  Sometimes not quite as often, or quite as much as you think the added time.
[5396.00 - 5397.36] P:1454.53 E:0.345951 |  So potentially it could be three.
[5398.00 - 5399.52] P:1388.68 E:0.366454 |  Three minutes before we find out.
[5399.52 - 5402.88] P:1507.60 E:0.323354 |  The amount of substitutions we have now could be eight.
[5403.84 - 5404.56] P:1630.01 E:0.394682 |  He's sterling.
[5405.44 - 5407.84] P:1623.47 E:0.357618 |  Back in defensive, Ducati adding starting well.
[5407.84 - 5409.44] P:1742.79 E:0.373751 |  Sheparding the ball over the line.
[5410.16 - 5411.12] P:1792.71 E:0.375344 |  And it goes out of play.
[5411.92 - 5416.16] P:1629.70 E:0.349585 |  A little chest bump there between sterling and Kier and Shupia.
[5416.16 - 5420.16] P:1508.36 E:0.370832 |  England know that they're on the verge of getting off to a winning start.
[5420.16 - 5421.12] P:1524.94 E:0.375021 |  But they also know.
[5422.08 - 5424.40] P:1464.22 E:0.375372 |  Like they haven't achieved anything yet.
[5424.40 - 5427.12] P:1493.41 E:0.376896 |  Pickford's spotted the ball down on the edge of the six-yard box.
[5428.00 - 5432.16] P:1499.82 E:0.391389 |  England just indulging in more match management as you would expect, as you would want.
[5433.28 - 5435.92] P:1400.60 E:0.370951 |  Wasting as much time as they think they can get away with.
[5436.64 - 5438.16] P:1567.14 E:0.387499 |  Pickford slams it forward now.
[5440.96 - 5442.72] P:1536.84 E:0.382468 |  Helped on through the midfield.
[5442.72 - 5444.08] P:1719.73 E:0.378697 |  There's a nasty clash ahead.
[5444.08 - 5447.04] P:1673.31 E:0.373458 |  Stomagoy-Theder has gone down and Jude Bellingham is down as well.
[5447.68 - 5450.88] P:1319.97 E:0.379895 |  And the referee indicating very quickly that he wants
[5451.60 - 5454.24] P:1315.52 E:0.369237 |  medical staff of both countries to come on.
[5454.96 - 5456.72] P:1587.68 E:0.356460 |  Veda is okay.
[5456.72 - 5457.92] P:1760.19 E:0.371860 |  He's sitting up straight away.
[5457.92 - 5458.96] P:1437.36 E:0.328665 |  In fact, he's got back on his feet.
[5458.96 - 5460.32] P:1523.01 E:0.354750 |  Jude Bellingham, less so.
[5460.32 - 5465.68] P:1344.50 E:0.347333 |  Now Bellingham, Veda could just brace himself for the inevitable collision.
[5465.68 - 5468.48] P:1509.57 E:0.357530 |  Bellingham with his back to the direction of play didn't know it was coming.
[5469.04 - 5470.72] P:1375.58 E:0.365803 |  And it's come off a worse of the two.
[5470.72 - 5473.36] P:1370.21 E:0.383264 |  Yeah, really big leap there by Bellingham.
[5473.36 - 5476.40] P:1347.31 E:0.365608 |  And when you jump and you're trying to flick the ball on.
[5477.04 - 5480.56] P:1280.63 E:0.380971 |  You leave yourself very, very open to anything that's coming in behind.
[5480.56 - 5483.68] P:1430.66 E:0.367650 |  It's just a very genuine clash of heads by both players.
[5484.48 - 5488.00] P:1270.07 E:0.378602 |  And Calvert-Lewin is being readied on the bench as we speak.
[5489.12 - 5493.60] P:1396.40 E:0.380874 |  Don Calvert-Lewin who scored the winner in the under 20 World Cup final against Vena as well.
[5493.60 - 5496.80] P:1386.78 E:0.370008 |  Back in 2017, four international goals.
[5496.80 - 5499.84] P:1486.63 E:0.376473 |  And this is first season as an England player.
[5499.84 - 5503.92] P:1343.36 E:0.387225 |  And he will also come on for his tournament debut in a moment.
[5504.64 - 5507.04] P:1291.42 E:0.374853 |  You're in the 89th minute.
[5509.04 - 5513.36] P:1470.25 E:0.377169 |  Raheem Sterling, who's the captain's arm band now that Harry Kane has gone off.
[5514.16 - 5517.04] P:1522.04 E:0.386374 |  And he's the man whose goal is the difference between the two sides.
[5517.04 - 5518.64] P:1323.95 E:0.373767 |  And he's just in this break of play.
[5519.28 - 5520.72] P:1272.99 E:0.385286 |  Going around some of his teammates.
[5522.56 - 5526.88] P:1401.37 E:0.382513 |  Just talking through what is necessary from here on in.
[5526.88 - 5527.84] P:1573.41 E:0.339293 |  Bellingham's okay.
[5527.84 - 5531.76] P:1514.67 E:0.356711 |  He's got the protective hand of his manager on his right shoulder at the moment.
[5531.76 - 5533.76] P:1332.50 E:0.361867 |  He's going to be way back on at the moment.
[5533.84 - 5536.16] P:1450.46 E:0.337944 |  England take the free kick and take it quickly.
[5536.16 - 5536.96] P:1920.99 E:0.358201 |  The idea was right.
[5536.96 - 5542.00] P:1600.96 E:0.339574 |  The execution not quite as mount had made a very good early run down towards the right hand corner flag.
[5542.00 - 5543.44] P:1470.05 E:0.337838 |  But the ball was overhead.
[5543.44 - 5545.68] P:1413.82 E:0.354360 |  And he goes out of play for a goal kick.
[5545.68 - 5548.56] P:1615.95 E:0.375718 |  And England not making the change just at the moment.
[5549.28 - 5551.52] P:1371.01 E:0.359950 |  Bellingham is back on.
[5551.52 - 5554.24] P:1428.18 E:0.337086 |  But Calvert-Lewin hasn't come on just yet.
[5554.24 - 5556.48] P:1511.38 E:0.331141 |  20 seconds plus stoppage time to go.
[5556.48 - 5559.20] P:1521.44 E:0.357133 |  Shaw will now be at least four minutes to be added on.
[5559.20 - 5562.40] P:1533.69 E:0.362967 |  Passionate Chazard on the left-hand side of the Croatian midfield.
[5563.76 - 5566.40] P:1545.36 E:0.358325 |  He goes back for his left back Guardiol.
[5566.40 - 5570.96] P:1526.81 E:0.369675 |  Who's been solid enough at the age of 19 on his full international day.
[5572.00 - 5574.00] P:1195.89 E:0.368512 |  It's got a bright future out of him.
[5574.00 - 5574.48] P:1486.58 E:0.349941 |  Fida.
[5575.68 - 5577.20] P:1469.99 E:0.384646 |  That's towards Vesalica.
[5578.72 - 5580.96] P:1356.80 E:0.369997 |  He will walk you back to his goalkeeper again.
[5580.96 - 5581.68] P:1519.52 E:0.368957 |  England happy.
[5581.68 - 5585.68] P:1479.06 E:0.341099 |  All the time that the ball is in that half of the field.
[5585.68 - 5587.12] P:1585.80 E:0.397797 |  Four minutes to be played.
[5588.32 - 5590.72] P:1486.96 E:0.380307 |  Long right foot of ball over the top from Calvert-Lewin.
[5590.72 - 5591.92] P:1846.89 E:0.347541 |  Paracic is going to chase it.
[5591.92 - 5593.04] P:1775.32 E:0.332449 |  Paracic nods it down.
[5593.04 - 5593.92] P:1750.83 E:0.334707 |  Should be Pickford's.
[5594.96 - 5597.44] P:1648.93 E:0.386378 |  And he will just let the ball roll and roll and roll.
[5597.44 - 5599.20] P:1740.02 E:0.338056 |  But still get there ahead of Pashlic.
[5600.40 - 5604.56] P:1620.95 E:0.362553 |  And England are three and a half minutes of playing time away from a victory.
[5604.56 - 5606.48] P:1570.43 E:0.384151 |  In the first game of Euro 2020.
[5606.48 - 5610.32] P:1369.40 E:0.387096 |  Yeah, fortunately there for England and Carl Walker.
[5610.32 - 5612.32] P:1484.36 E:0.388716 |  Paracic didn't have any support with him.
[5612.32 - 5616.16] P:1362.27 E:0.380196 |  So when he headed in across Galway, it was three England defenders.
[5616.16 - 5618.08] P:1434.72 E:0.381392 |  And Pickford just went up in the problem up.
[5620.96 - 5624.48] P:1502.49 E:0.388913 |  England have only had two shots on target in 90 minutes.
[5627.36 - 5628.32] P:1562.71 E:0.410182 |  One of them has gone in.
[5629.28 - 5631.76] P:1329.05 E:0.385864 |  In tournament football sometimes that's all that matters.
[5634.48 - 5637.68] P:1495.92 E:0.353170 |  More importantly Jim, sorry, he's affecting the creations.
[5637.68 - 5639.92] P:1361.74 E:0.348659 |  I'm not sure how many they've had won.
[5639.92 - 5643.04] P:1387.90 E:0.335390 |  So that is a more impressive stat I think for us.
[5647.28 - 5650.00] P:1707.15 E:0.404877 |  There's our play for Goldgear, which the back of itch is going to take.
[5651.68 - 5655.52] P:1674.27 E:0.373225 |  He leaves the field, chucks the captain's arm and Marcus Rashford.
[5655.52 - 5657.84] P:1724.06 E:0.389245 |  And here's Dominic Cowan-Lewin.
[5659.04 - 5661.20] P:1649.04 E:0.374840 |  Wearing 18 and coming on.
[5661.20 - 5663.68] P:1763.97 E:0.359779 |  Here's the international cap count up into double figures.
[5664.24 - 5668.96] P:1531.01 E:0.361658 |  And he'll come on for the last two and a half, three minutes or so.
[5668.96 - 5673.28] P:1633.54 E:0.335466 |  England just have to stand firm for the next few exchanges.
[5674.96 - 5677.12] P:1490.53 E:0.383101 |  Ball play four down the Croatian right.
[5677.12 - 5679.36] P:1613.10 E:0.337177 |  Mings letting the ball run across his bodies.
[5679.44 - 5680.32] P:1387.92 E:0.329846 |  And put under pressure.
[5680.32 - 5682.08] P:1561.54 E:0.349988 |  He has been able to get it back to his goalkeeper,
[5682.08 - 5685.52] P:1603.95 E:0.339649 |  although Pickford had to scramble to stop it going out of play for a corner.
[5685.52 - 5687.12] P:1569.22 E:0.303914 |  Launched forward by Pickford.
[5687.12 - 5691.92] P:1583.58 E:0.320677 |  Cowan-Lewin are such a fantastic outball now for any aerial ball that's
[5691.92 - 5694.08] P:1651.94 E:0.317510 |  sent forward from the England back line.
[5694.08 - 5696.48] P:1436.14 E:0.313777 |  Cowan-Lewin won it, but Croatia won the seconds.
[5697.20 - 5699.44] P:1408.47 E:0.281539 |  Good play from Vardion.
[5699.44 - 5701.60] P:1565.76 E:0.310711 |  Very neat and tidy in possession.
[5701.60 - 5702.88] P:1512.78 E:0.307177 |  Finding Modric.
[5702.88 - 5705.28] P:1629.95 E:0.352842 |  Modric to his right hand side for Vida.
[5706.08 - 5707.28] P:1423.10 E:0.396043 |  We're in the 93rd minute.
[5707.28 - 5709.36] P:1578.53 E:0.362269 |  One little England here on Torxport.
[5709.36 - 5711.44] P:1748.02 E:0.339843 |  Flash hits and Breckelow combining.
[5711.44 - 5713.68] P:1712.15 E:0.373637 |  Sliding challenge comes in to knock it away.
[5713.68 - 5715.04] P:1624.26 E:0.336033 |  That came from Drew Bellingham.
[5715.04 - 5720.08] P:1658.17 E:0.369550 |  It was much appreciated, excuse me, by the England crowd.
[5720.88 - 5723.60] P:1570.01 E:0.345965 |  I thought the ball had gone out of play for a throw and hadn't.
[5723.60 - 5724.48] P:1688.67 E:0.371882 |  Modric has it.
[5724.48 - 5726.80] P:1660.92 E:0.332471 |  The deepest of all the Croatian outfield players.
[5726.80 - 5728.48] P:1777.00 E:0.351464 |  Sent forward inside the penalty area.
[5728.48 - 5730.64] P:1748.51 E:0.328441 |  Pickford comes out and catches it.
[5731.84 - 5733.60] P:1881.63 E:0.352820 |  And England are nearly there.
[5733.60 - 5734.40] P:1825.28 E:0.336311 |  Stuart Pierce.
[5735.04 - 5738.24] P:1784.24 E:0.359490 |  Yeah, we've been pretty consistent this second half.
[5738.24 - 5740.80] P:1557.54 E:0.357250 |  And to be fair, once we get a nose in front,
[5740.80 - 5745.68] P:1578.89 E:0.364070 |  I haven't really been threatened too much with Croatia getting back into the game.
[5745.68 - 5747.20] P:1468.27 E:0.367706 |  This will give us a wonderful lift.
[5747.20 - 5749.44] P:1422.30 E:0.386161 |  If we go over the line here with three points,
[5749.44 - 5752.40] P:1497.66 E:0.378910 |  first group game, which England really do,
[5752.40 - 5755.44] P:1450.37 E:0.373874 |  will give to squad and the team and the manager a big lift.
[5756.00 - 5761.36] P:1551.95 E:0.367219 |  And they have been eliminated in the group stage four times in the last eight tournaments.
[5761.36 - 5767.20] P:1543.22 E:0.346552 |  But this result will mean that chances of that happening are extremely small.
[5768.08 - 5769.36] P:1641.76 E:0.398388 |  Providing they can hold on.
[5770.16 - 5772.16] P:1604.36 E:0.371430 |  Carl Walker lays it back for his goalkeeper.
[5772.16 - 5774.00] P:1710.13 E:0.316269 |  Pickford's got time to take a touch.
[5774.00 - 5775.92] P:1737.38 E:0.364125 |  And his second one goes off the island,
[5775.92 - 5779.44] P:1753.15 E:0.347875 |  but out of play for a throw just in Croatian territory.
[5779.44 - 5784.00] P:1780.09 E:0.384101 |  And we've got 40 seconds of the minimum four minutes still to be played.
[5785.12 - 5787.44] P:1862.45 E:0.406795 |  England crowd wanting to hear the four-time whistle.
[5788.08 - 5789.52] P:1910.48 E:0.389313 |  Feder to Modric.
[5790.08 - 5792.32] P:1840.40 E:0.348670 |  Chip Ford, Matt lets it run.
[5792.32 - 5794.24] P:1705.46 E:0.342127 |  Calvin Phillips lets it run out.
[5794.24 - 5797.44] P:1701.58 E:0.385694 |  And it's a throw to England inside the round half.
[5797.44 - 5800.80] P:1799.69 E:0.363498 |  And another chance just to run the clock down.
[5801.68 - 5803.92] P:1766.08 E:0.372268 |  England close, so close.
[5803.92 - 5806.80] P:1657.09 E:0.380716 |  Finishing line almost within touch and distance.
[5808.40 - 5809.52] P:1506.60 E:0.382322 |  What a lift.
[5809.52 - 5813.84] P:1582.07 E:0.373846 |  This will give the players what a lift it will give the England supporters.
[5814.72 - 5817.68] P:1549.71 E:0.365018 |  Walker throwing it forward over the head of Coward-Lewin.
[5817.68 - 5819.28] P:1698.98 E:0.343391 |  Rashford able to win the seconds.
[5820.08 - 5824.24] P:1799.83 E:0.374646 |  Play back to the goalkeeper, Lebacowicz takes a touch, comes outside the penalty area.
[5824.88 - 5827.20] P:1889.47 E:0.362110 |  His Vida four minutes are up.
[5827.20 - 5828.56] P:1916.40 E:0.374909 |  High ball fall from Vida.
[5829.68 - 5831.36] P:1801.73 E:0.364872 |  Flick's on, but away from Perisic.
[5831.36 - 5834.08] P:1756.56 E:0.359514 |  He'll go out of play for a Croatian throw.
[5834.08 - 5836.16] P:1780.70 E:0.352716 |  Left with the edge of the England penalty area.
[5836.16 - 5840.08] P:1813.48 E:0.354861 |  Perisic waves everybody inside the box, but they'll barely be time to take the throw.
[5840.80 - 5841.92] P:1921.82 E:0.373169 |  Peckovic is in there.
[5841.92 - 5843.52] P:1764.87 E:0.375312 |  The principal aerial target.
[5844.40 - 5846.08] P:1806.59 E:0.361574 |  Shadow the Stars in there as well.
[5846.08 - 5847.28] P:1570.11 E:0.347533 |  Long throw inside the box.
[5847.28 - 5850.96] P:1723.55 E:0.357990 |  England with a contact, plays over the bar from Pasalic.
[5850.96 - 5852.40] P:1682.97 E:0.345648 |  And that should be that.
[5852.40 - 5854.48] P:1765.25 E:0.357258 |  And the referee signals the end of the game.
[5855.36 - 5860.96] P:1732.85 E:0.349636 |  England off to a winning start in the Euros for the first time in their history.
[5861.68 - 5868.08] P:1736.92 E:0.323749 |  At the tenth time of asking, it's the W for the three Lions first up.
[5868.08 - 5872.16] P:1780.29 E:0.334962 |  And it all came after Calvin Phillips' excellent contribution.
[5872.24 - 5874.08] P:1854.24 E:0.369133 |  Slipping Raheem Sterling in.
[5874.08 - 5877.04] P:1831.46 E:0.349307 |  The one moment of genuine England attacking quality.

[5879.52 - 5883.20] P:1755.57 E:0.344285 |  Defensively, this remodeled defence was sound.
[5883.20 - 5885.60] P:1798.32 E:0.365938 |  Only one Croatian shot on target.
[5885.60 - 5889.04] P:1722.24 E:0.364707 |  Certainly more to come from England as an attacking force.
