[0.00 - 5.00] P:1955.41 E:0.089762 |  good evening and welcome to
[5.00 - 6.00] P:1807.12 E:0.098639 |  a Bami evening in Manchester.
[6.00 - 8.00] P:2046.99 E:0.080046 |  Manchester City against Napoli
[8.00 - 10.00] P:1915.92 E:0.092112 |  to kick off their Champions League
[10.00 - 12.00] P:1978.89 E:0.099092 |  campaigns and it is a return to
[12.00 - 14.00] P:1864.86 E:0.084286 |  the elite European competition
[14.00 - 16.00] P:1965.48 E:0.099877 |  for Serie A champions Napoli who
[16.00 - 18.00] P:1911.02 E:0.097355 |  missed out last year. Manchester
[18.00 - 19.00] P:1930.86 E:0.110047 |  City, they might have been in the
[19.00 - 21.00] P:2027.04 E:0.082063 |  competition last year but it was
[21.00 - 23.00] P:1937.36 E:0.074769 |  really a year to forget as they
[23.00 - 25.00] P:1741.20 E:0.098090 |  crashed out in the pre last 16
[25.00 - 27.00] P:1692.33 E:0.070962 |  playoff round. They are hoping
[27.00 - 29.00] P:1858.36 E:0.095185 |  for better this season but for
[29.00 - 31.00] P:1789.48 E:0.077010 |  the first time in a row they
[31.00 - 33.00] P:1928.52 E:0.102595 |  have been in the competition
[33.00 - 35.00] P:1911.32 E:0.087065 |  for the first time in a row.
[35.00 - 36.00] P:2016.44 E:0.091794 |  Manchester City has been
[36.00 - 38.00] P:1929.31 E:0.095844 |  in between two massive Premier
[38.00 - 40.00] P:2007.17 E:0.081482 |  League matches. The Derby
[40.00 - 42.00] P:1992.35 E:0.085592 |  successfully navigated on Sunday.
[42.00 - 43.00] P:1936.39 E:0.105201 |  This weekend they travelled to
[43.00 - 45.00] P:2088.06 E:0.083781 |  Arsenal so a few interested in
[45.00 - 47.00] P:1992.80 E:0.074488 |  what the team line up might be
[47.00 - 49.00] P:1938.95 E:0.093334 |  and I can tell you there are no
[49.00 - 51.00] P:1867.80 E:0.090612 |  changes from the starting 11
[51.00 - 53.00] P:1875.74 E:0.092857 |  that started against Manchester
[53.00 - 55.00] P:1916.76 E:0.087568 |  United at the weekend. So
[55.00 - 57.00] P:1855.87 E:0.088026 |  Gianluigi Donnarumma the
[57.00 - 59.00] P:1757.07 E:0.083529 |  first time in a row.
[59.00 - 61.00] P:1949.04 E:0.091343 |  The team has a right back
[61.00 - 63.00] P:1742.99 E:0.090208 |  Abdukadir Kasanov, Rodri and
[63.00 - 65.00] P:1776.67 E:0.079514 |  Reinders in the midfield with
[65.00 - 67.00] P:1980.50 E:0.086122 |  Phil Ford in ahead of them. Jeremy
[67.00 - 69.00] P:1707.78 E:0.082575 |  Dockoo who had his two assists in
[69.00 - 71.00] P:1759.99 E:0.093933 |  the Derby on the left. Bernardo
[71.00 - 73.00] P:1814.52 E:0.079068 |  Silva on the right and Erling
[73.00 - 75.00] P:1769.48 E:0.083230 |  Halland who if he scores tonight
[75.00 - 77.00] P:1779.68 E:0.068313 |  will become the fastest to 50
[77.00 - 79.00] P:1804.67 E:0.106598 |  goals in Champions League history.
[79.00 - 81.00] P:1823.48 E:0.083675 |  Michael Brown alongside me. Any
[81.00 - 83.00] P:1711.12 E:0.075174 |  surprise at all with that line
[83.00 - 85.00] P:1691.22 E:0.094051 |  up?
[85.00 - 87.00] P:1946.87 E:0.087083 |  I'm not sure if you can see
[87.00 - 89.00] P:1845.34 E:0.102755 |  that but what it is now with this
[89.00 - 91.00] P:1907.37 E:0.100126 |  change look and new back room
[91.00 - 93.00] P:1925.84 E:0.092510 |  staff is trying to find formula as
[93.00 - 95.00] P:1946.78 E:0.104396 |  a consistent Manchester City.
[95.00 - 97.00] P:1922.20 E:0.084863 |  They started really well in the
[97.00 - 99.00] P:1892.33 E:0.101655 |  first day. Then lacked in form
[99.00 - 101.00] P:1939.39 E:0.092563 |  conceding many opportunities
[101.00 - 103.00] P:1812.09 E:0.092905 |  against them not getting results.
[103.00 - 105.00] P:1935.51 E:0.073182 |  It was a shot with being a couple
[105.00 - 107.00] P:1797.46 E:0.068750 |  of injuries and those full back
[107.00 - 109.00] P:1949.78 E:0.108810 |  areas those mostly players like
[109.00 - 111.00] P:1864.15 E:0.099131 |  Nikko O'Reilly cushion off not
[111.00 - 113.00] P:1821.69 E:0.082608 |  necessarily set out to be in
[113.00 - 115.00] P:2034.42 E:0.074016 |  the next round.
[115.00 - 117.00] P:1845.24 E:0.096325 |  We will see Nikko O'Reilly's
[117.00 - 119.00] P:1914.39 E:0.066811 |  had more run in that area but
[119.00 - 121.00] P:1925.90 E:0.059252 |  now when the Champions League
[121.00 - 123.00] P:1835.96 E:0.094410 |  comes in the Arsenal game just
[123.00 - 125.00] P:1847.77 E:0.083439 |  around the corner it's going to be
[125.00 - 127.00] P:1853.90 E:0.098090 |  bigger tests along the way so
[127.00 - 129.00] P:1949.95 E:0.089856 |  stuck with it maybe the extra day
[129.00 - 131.00] P:1726.12 E:0.104462 |  of the rest in the middle of the
[131.00 - 133.00] P:1959.34 E:0.088448 |  week as well playing on a very
[133.00 - 135.00] P:1888.63 E:0.111184 |  strange night on a Thursday in the
[135.00 - 137.00] P:1877.18 E:0.089547 |  Champions League. I believe this is
[137.00 - 139.00] P:1844.92 E:0.086504 |  the only time that will happen but
[139.00 - 141.00] P:1888.70 E:0.076508 |  they've got to be on the front foot
[141.00 - 143.00] P:1918.11 E:0.097842 |  of the Champions League.
[143.00 - 145.00] P:1982.65 E:0.088034 |  They are in form. They have three
[145.00 - 147.00] P:1868.57 E:0.090421 |  wins out of three in the Serie A
[147.00 - 149.00] P:1935.73 E:0.086045 |  so far this season and they have
[149.00 - 151.00] P:1916.11 E:0.071761 |  some very familiar faces to the
[151.00 - 153.00] P:1988.77 E:0.088782 |  Premier League and for one
[153.00 - 155.00] P:1914.87 E:0.071900 |  particularly to this stadium. Kevin
[155.00 - 157.00] P:1953.66 E:0.096063 |  De Bruyne returns for the first
[157.00 - 159.00] P:1984.38 E:0.080168 |  time since moving to the Italian
[159.00 - 161.00] P:1851.16 E:0.077314 |  Champions. He's already scored
[161.00 - 163.00] P:1835.36 E:0.079952 |  twice in their opening three
[163.00 - 165.00] P:2014.20 E:0.093125 |  matches and they line up with
[165.00 - 167.00] P:2022.07 E:0.079144 |  Malinkovic Savic in goal. A back
[167.00 - 169.00] P:1953.72 E:0.082243 |  four of Leonardo Spinozola,
[169.00 - 171.00] P:1881.14 E:0.085540 |  and their captain Giovanni D'Lorenzo.
[171.00 - 173.00] P:1775.11 E:0.077549 |  Stanislaw Lobotka in front of
[173.00 - 175.00] P:1927.24 E:0.088365 |  them in that holding role. A midfield
[175.00 - 177.00] P:1923.25 E:0.096904 |  four in front of him of Scott
[177.00 - 179.00] P:1925.01 E:0.087189 |  MacTomany, Kevin De Bruyne, Frank
[179.00 - 181.00] P:1846.89 E:0.081299 |  Nguysa and Matteo Politano with
[181.00 - 183.00] P:1993.22 E:0.083607 |  Rasmus Hoiland who scored on his
[183.00 - 185.00] P:1920.16 E:0.070319 |  debut at the weekend leading
[185.00 - 187.00] P:1800.36 E:0.082243 |  the line up front. It is a
[187.00 - 189.00] P:1807.07 E:0.102085 |  little bit of a new look Napoli
[189.00 - 191.00] P:1837.32 E:0.087119 |  side this season still under Antonio
[191.00 - 193.00] P:1886.06 E:0.082354 |  Conti but he's moved away from some
[193.00 - 195.00] P:1813.94 E:0.084172 |  of his traditional principles no more
[195.00 - 197.00] P:1911.79 E:0.086062 |  back three for a start. How big a
[197.00 - 199.00] P:1971.42 E:0.058041 |  challenge is it to play with
[199.00 - 201.00] P:1874.60 E:0.104017 |  the players? What are the
[201.00 - 203.00] P:1940.53 E:0.082563 |  challenges that you're going to
[203.00 - 205.00] P:2036.12 E:0.089838 |  see in the post this evening?
[205.00 - 207.00] P:1883.95 E:0.071355 |  Big challenge because they're the
[207.00 - 209.00] P:1734.77 E:0.086712 |  ones in form. A wonderful record
[209.00 - 211.00] P:1913.36 E:0.070592 |  last season. Can they repeat it
[211.00 - 213.00] P:1781.22 E:0.102068 |  will see but they've found
[213.00 - 215.00] P:1907.06 E:0.052305 |  ways to win covered a few of their
[215.00 - 217.00] P:1981.89 E:0.059005 |  games so far. A formula still
[217.00 - 219.00] P:1951.39 E:0.051729 |  with new players. Lukaku was the
[219.00 - 221.00] P:2095.93 E:0.106146 |  big blow right on the start of
[221.00 - 223.00] P:1974.29 E:0.079809 |  the new season. So they'll
[223.00 - 225.00] P:2129.29 E:0.090699 |  fancy their chances tonight.
[225.00 - 227.00] P:2060.54 E:0.080220 |  They've got a lot of
[227.00 - 229.00] P:1818.73 E:0.072024 |  players in the team. They've got
[229.00 - 231.00] P:2032.68 E:0.065857 |  quite shorts and light blue socks
[231.00 - 233.00] P:2126.08 E:0.084604 |  playing from our left to right
[233.00 - 235.00] P:2099.73 E:0.058570 |  Napoli in their change kit of
[235.00 - 237.00] P:1907.33 E:0.044528 |  Navy shot shorts, Navy shirts
[237.00 - 239.00] P:1816.08 E:0.068805 |  and Navy socks. And it has
[239.00 - 241.00] P:1796.74 E:0.086044 |  been. Quite a good
[241.00 - 243.00] P:1811.32 E:0.072137 |  atmosphere in the build up to
[243.00 - 245.00] P:2005.66 E:0.081992 |  this one. I've noticed quite a few
[245.00 - 247.00] P:1641.61 E:0.077230 |  Kevin De Bruyne flags. I'm not
[247.00 - 249.00] P:1611.44 E:0.085911 |  sure if they've come from Napoli
[249.00 - 251.00] P:1825.99 E:0.071445 |  fans or from Manchester City
[251.00 - 253.00] P:1922.24 E:0.086163 |  fans, but he certainly had a warm
[253.00 - 255.00] P:1831.31 E:0.083987 |  welcome. And we've got a lot of
[255.00 - 257.00] P:1927.81 E:0.068925 |  players in the team. We've got
[257.00 - 259.00] P:1791.13 E:0.035081 |  a lot of players in the team.
[259.00 - 261.00] P:1845.64 E:0.095413 |  We talk about legends. We talk
[261.00 - 263.00] P:2010.84 E:0.076647 |  about top players and mistake
[263.00 - 265.00] P:1982.62 E:0.073965 |  that. Mistake that doesn't come
[265.00 - 267.00] P:1787.96 E:0.074306 |  to anything. It is hammered clear
[267.00 - 269.00] P:1961.09 E:0.075319 |  by Rodri and Helen will look to
[269.00 - 271.00] P:2207.82 E:0.083607 |  try and put some pressure on the
[271.00 - 273.00] P:1981.83 E:0.085127 |  defense at the back, but it's
[273.00 - 275.00] P:1909.23 E:0.054351 |  headed comfortably back to
[275.00 - 277.00] P:1857.91 E:0.066714 |  Malinkovic Savage in goal for
[277.00 - 279.00] P:1996.49 E:0.060588 |  them. He made his debut at the
[279.00 - 281.00] P:1940.14 E:0.063329 |  weekend against Fiorentina.
[281.00 - 283.00] P:1840.16 E:0.075375 |  He's been playing for the
[283.00 - 285.00] P:1796.44 E:0.076787 |  World Cup in Manchester on the
[285.00 - 287.00] P:1999.17 E:0.077032 |  Red half never made an appearance
[287.00 - 289.00] P:1974.20 E:0.063695 |  though as Napoli go direct
[289.00 - 291.00] P:2051.25 E:0.060467 |  looking for Hoyland, but it's
[291.00 - 293.00] P:1874.07 E:0.078093 |  headed clear by Diaz. And now
[293.00 - 295.00] P:2016.19 E:0.085273 |  Guardiola mops things up, puts
[295.00 - 297.00] P:1983.81 E:0.051705 |  his foot on the ball, looks for a
[297.00 - 299.00] P:2139.67 E:0.081561 |  teammate gets it back and it goes
[299.00 - 301.00] P:2034.69 E:0.078823 |  all the way back to Donnaruma, who
[301.00 - 303.00] P:2083.59 E:0.096222 |  has it at his feet, and it was a
[303.00 - 305.00] P:2036.51 E:0.069940 |  very interesting press conference
[305.00 - 307.00] P:1920.15 E:0.092326 |  from Donnaruma yesterday when he
[307.00 - 309.00] P:1696.29 E:0.095064 |  spoke ahead of this game about how
[309.00 - 311.00] P:1898.30 E:0.084997 |  he's making saves. I mean, he's
[311.00 - 313.00] P:1855.43 E:0.066020 |  a man mountain.
[313.00 - 315.00] P:1850.79 E:0.101271 |  Here he is now, he's rolling the
[315.00 - 317.00] P:1907.59 E:0.090967 |  ball out. A couple of short passes
[317.00 - 319.00] P:1961.11 E:0.081047 |  he's just waiting for the press,
[319.00 - 321.00] P:1899.11 E:0.089885 |  can he bounce it? Harlan's got a
[321.00 - 323.00] P:1765.15 E:0.089221 |  screen on. Can they go tight? He
[323.00 - 325.00] P:1822.01 E:0.075395 |  just wants to drop it in, one for
[325.00 - 327.00] P:1945.72 E:0.049620 |  one, you can't do that with
[327.00 - 329.00] P:1799.29 E:0.055636 |  Erling Harlan, he decides to go
[329.00 - 331.00] P:1593.79 E:0.104895 |  short. He does and now on this
[331.00 - 333.00] P:1930.30 E:0.101594 |  right-hand side, Koshanov,
[333.00 - 335.00] P:2053.72 E:0.087718 |  Manchester City just trying to
[335.00 - 337.00] P:1924.49 E:0.088775 |  build a little bit of possession.
[337.00 - 339.00] P:1973.36 E:0.065134 |  Now he's going to the right
[339.00 - 341.00] P:1781.27 E:0.088344 |  hand side.
[341.00 - 343.00] P:1868.54 E:0.090197 |  And now he's a little bit of
[343.00 - 345.00] P:1835.25 E:0.084648 |  Guardiola to drive into, crossing
[345.00 - 347.00] P:1727.51 E:0.098412 |  the halfway line, looking for
[347.00 - 349.00] P:2085.48 E:0.055401 |  options, waving his arms around. He
[349.00 - 351.00] P:2075.25 E:0.065703 |  doesn't have anything ahead, so he's
[351.00 - 353.00] P:2049.95 E:0.083958 |  come back to Diaz, but Manchester
[353.00 - 355.00] P:2158.01 E:0.071576 |  City now all in Napoli's half,
[355.00 - 357.00] P:2091.24 E:0.091755 |  just waiting for their moment.
[357.00 - 359.00] P:1971.50 E:0.077255 |  Defence, happy to hold
[359.00 - 361.00] P:1970.35 E:0.082877 |  onto the ball.
[361.00 - 363.00] P:1900.86 E:0.078730 |  And now Rodri has it, he almost
[363.00 - 365.00] P:1963.01 E:0.106191 |  went for the long ball in
[365.00 - 367.00] P:1951.81 E:0.088477 |  the last two years, but he's
[367.00 - 369.00] P:1823.57 E:0.085018 |  now in the final.
[369.00 - 371.00] P:1876.30 E:0.078385 |  And now he's going to play
[371.00 - 373.00] P:1913.01 E:0.086923 |  against Manchester United at the
[373.00 - 375.00] P:1782.08 E:0.055957 |  weekend. Now tries to play a
[375.00 - 377.00] P:1818.33 E:0.057891 |  little ball through to Harlan,
[377.00 - 379.00] P:1854.60 E:0.060789 |  it's cut out, but there is nobody
[379.00 - 381.00] P:1878.79 E:0.066503 |  up the pitch for Napoli, and
[381.00 - 383.00] P:1942.93 E:0.097375 |  again, Manchester City will come
[383.00 - 385.00] P:1964.99 E:0.066559 |  and this will be a very
[385.00 - 387.00] P:1871.60 E:0.082117 |  different test for Napoli. They
[387.00 - 389.00] P:2025.31 E:0.072750 |  won the championship on the
[389.00 - 391.00] P:1962.14 E:0.062787 |  final day, really dramatic end to
[391.00 - 393.00] P:1858.15 E:0.089245 |  the Serie A season, last season,
[393.00 - 395.00] P:1940.32 E:0.064596 |  and now they're going to play
[395.00 - 397.00] P:1963.79 E:0.067768 |  against the club, and they're
[397.00 - 399.00] P:1963.98 E:0.092616 |  going to be a challenge to the
[399.00 - 401.00] P:1904.79 E:0.098268 |  teams in Italy.
[401.00 - 403.00] P:1836.30 E:0.084329 |  Yeah, there being no rush, just
[403.00 - 405.00] P:2014.83 E:0.053728 |  let Manchester City, good
[405.00 - 407.00] P:1891.63 E:0.111318 |  position, wasn't it? Yosco
[407.00 - 409.00] P:2018.70 E:0.082046 |  Vardio in the centre of the
[409.00 - 411.00] P:1863.99 E:0.089663 |  pitch, that fullback coming to
[411.00 - 413.00] P:2052.63 E:0.077956 |  central midfield. He's the link.
[413.00 - 415.00] P:2061.33 E:0.067291 |  And it's out on the left-hand
[415.00 - 417.00] P:2064.01 E:0.098157 |  side with O'Reilly chops back
[417.00 - 419.00] P:1960.17 E:0.079496 |  onto his right foot, finds
[419.00 - 421.00] P:2052.81 E:0.041771 |  Dooku edge of the penalty area on
[421.00 - 423.00] P:2031.90 E:0.100134 |  the left foot, and then
[423.00 - 425.00] P:1900.25 E:0.092386 |  plays it out on the left foot,
[425.00 - 427.00] P:1844.26 E:0.105117 |  and then goes to the right
[427.00 - 429.00] P:1849.72 E:0.098533 |  foot. But there's a little
[429.00 - 431.00] P:2057.88 E:0.092424 |  bit of pressure here between
[431.00 - 432.00] P:1861.20 E:0.043315 |  Team
[432.00 - 434.00] P:1968.75 E:0.081835 |  Pett Guardiola, having a little
[434.00 - 436.00] P:1860.54 E:0.066865 |  word with that. Just step back
[436.00 - 438.00] P:1849.07 E:0.053718 |  for him, you can't get involved
[438.00 - 440.00] P:1935.11 E:0.083776 |  with shots like that from 30
[440.00 - 442.00] P:1825.08 E:0.098667 |  yards. Stay where he is, Pett
[442.00 - 444.00] P:1873.99 E:0.112525 |  Guardiola in his suit tonight,
[444.00 - 446.00] P:1863.81 E:0.087961 |  with a little jumper on, sits
[446.00 - 448.00] P:1894.68 E:0.058638 |  back down. He's looking very
[448.00 - 450.00] P:1873.27 E:0.056533 |  smart. He always does. You know,
[450.00 - 456.36] P:1924.42 E:0.082776 |  only active manager in football right now who has played Pep Guardiola at least six times
[456.36 - 465.64] P:1910.29 E:0.068567 |  and has a better win rate than the Manchester City manager. So, could be an interesting
[465.64 - 468.56] P:1926.86 E:0.075699 |  tactical battle from the two in the dugout.
[468.56 - 473.92] P:2002.50 E:0.078486 |  Yeah, it could. Cushing off now, just setting up the throw in and it's near side. Both managers
[473.92 - 478.32] P:1839.37 E:0.083614 |  in the front of the technical area, you talk about battles, you talk about experienced
[478.32 - 483.80] P:1885.50 E:0.070181 |  winners, demands. These two don't get any more, do they? What they expect? Great turn
[483.80 - 484.80] P:1951.12 E:0.058033 |  from Doku.
[484.80 - 489.68] P:1956.00 E:0.090464 |  And Doku driving forward now right through the heart of Napoli's defence. He tries to
[489.68 - 493.96] P:1925.17 E:0.084242 |  find Halland, it's cut out but the referee is going to give a free kick in the edge of
[493.96 - 501.68] P:1966.46 E:0.074697 |  the area. Doku just catching Bakema, the Napoli centre half as he tried to drive forward.
[501.68 - 503.92] P:1970.73 E:0.069184 |  It was a really good break from the Belgian.
[503.92 - 507.96] P:1932.57 E:0.087187 |  Yeah, the pace was fantastic through the middle of the pitch. What was good is awareness. He
[507.96 - 513.80] P:1999.65 E:0.078749 |  knew the space and then he drives right through but his pass is poor. Then he makes a challenge.
[513.80 - 519.04] P:1879.31 E:0.089039 |  Is there much contact? Is it high? He's trying to get another little look here. Paul Otano.
[519.04 - 523.92] P:1962.18 E:0.086056 |  Yeah, it's just literally a little tap on the inside of his calf. He didn't really have
[523.92 - 530.12] P:1866.44 E:0.069767 |  any intent. The referee decides it's a free kick and can't really argue with it.
[530.12 - 535.40] P:1912.95 E:0.076388 |  The length of it, Savage takes it, plays it out short. To Kevin De Bruyne, who's got
[535.40 - 541.52] P:1769.00 E:0.066040 |  La Butka alongside him. Now Napoli come down the right-hand side with Dilarenzo. He's
[541.52 - 546.00] P:1945.42 E:0.090198 |  looking for the run forward but Kvarniol is there to knock it back to Donor. Amanda Pressure
[546.00 - 552.76] P:1874.44 E:0.057124 |  from Huyland gets it out to Diaz. And Diaz now to Koshanov, who played in that right
[552.76 - 556.76] P:1843.54 E:0.058085 |  back position at the weekend. And it was very impressive.
[556.76 - 562.56] P:1914.18 E:0.063659 |  Yeah, he was. He wasn't under too much pressure. He just stayed in his line. He didn't have
[562.72 - 567.40] P:1865.56 E:0.083269 |  too much to think about early on in his tenure as a right back. We're seeing obviously Rico
[567.40 - 571.00] P:1851.87 E:0.093289 |  Lewis go and join the midfield and stay in there. And then his timing. He did ever so
[571.00 - 575.76] P:1796.14 E:0.080857 |  well for a long period of time. But Kusanov now, it looks like he needs to defend first,
[575.76 - 577.88] P:1852.17 E:0.088750 |  is the message from Pep Guardiola.
[577.88 - 584.08] P:1886.60 E:0.087418 |  Yeah, Spinazzola, the Napoli left back. He will fly up and down that left-hand side all
[584.08 - 589.24] P:1858.26 E:0.070702 |  night long. He's got Scott McTominay, who sort of starts out in the left but drifts
[589.40 - 595.68] P:1904.34 E:0.076030 |  into a central area. Also will cause a few problems. I'm sure he's had such an incredible
[595.68 - 600.48] P:1813.45 E:0.091966 |  season last season after his move to Napoli from Manchester United. One that Antonio
[600.48 - 607.16] P:1869.12 E:0.048694 |  Conti said he didn't think would happen but was very glad it did. I'm sure Scott McTominay
[607.16 - 610.88] P:1721.95 E:0.069238 |  was as well because he was named the best midfielder in Serie A.
[610.88 - 613.96] P:1767.94 E:0.100806 |  Yeah, and he went back to Manchester United to have another look to see if he can find
[613.96 - 615.16] P:1238.02 E:0.112142 |  another one with Huyland.
[616.08 - 617.60] P:1939.27 E:0.070884 |  It's worked out well so far.
[617.60 - 624.44] P:1911.77 E:0.071313 |  Yeah, it has. And they're just waiting. Defensive line is trying to frustrate Manchester City,
[624.44 - 628.92] P:1844.03 E:0.091284 |  block, delay. De Bruyne, as you said, just had that touch stepping forward onto Ruben Diaz.
[631.08 - 635.60] P:1864.67 E:0.092022 |  And now Bernardo Silva, twisting, turning, looking for options. He's gone back to Diaz.
[635.60 - 639.40] P:1947.22 E:0.091414 |  Diaz now with Foden, who's flicked it out to the right-hand side. Little bit of a miscommunication
[639.40 - 644.20] P:1900.94 E:0.078418 |  between Foden and Silva. There doesn't happen very often out for a Napoli throw-in, which
[644.24 - 649.08] P:1915.85 E:0.078577 |  goes back to Malinkovic. Savage, he puts his foot through it, high into the night sky
[649.08 - 654.60] P:1923.77 E:0.072666 |  here at the Etihad. And it is Koshanov who gets there first ahead of McTominay. The
[654.60 - 659.36] P:1914.83 E:0.080679 |  ball just bubbling around a little bit, but now Guardiola looks to try and calm things
[659.36 - 662.28] P:1745.92 E:0.069396 |  down in the centre circle, Manchester City.
[665.00 - 671.48] P:1965.91 E:0.068844 |  Just moving the ball around. Still waiting for our first attempt on goal inside this
[671.48 - 677.80] P:1781.41 E:0.052429 |  opening eight minutes, but both teams just trying to settle into the game. And Manchester
[677.80 - 683.72] P:1877.26 E:0.064152 |  City now trying to put together a little bit of possession. Dooku again on the ball, plays
[683.72 - 689.24] P:1878.23 E:0.083090 |  it back to Diaz. Diaz sweeps the ball over the halfway line to Koshanov on the right-hand
[689.24 - 698.12] P:1817.93 E:0.068137 |  side. He's got Diaz back again. And now Rodri and Napoli sitting in that rigid formation,
[698.20 - 703.24] P:1926.73 E:0.068169 |  asking Manchester City to find a way to break them down. They'll be quite happy to just
[703.24 - 708.24] P:1952.68 E:0.088458 |  let City have the ball as long as it's in front of them. And now a shot from the right-hand
[708.24 - 711.76] P:2005.22 E:0.097039 |  side, and that's pulled off the first save off the game from Malinkovic. Savage, it was
[711.76 - 717.12] P:2026.90 E:0.083261 |  a wicked effort from Reinders. Outside the penalty area, he put his right foot through
[717.12 - 721.64] P:1926.16 E:0.068482 |  it. And Malinkovic, Savage, watched it all the way, had to flick it over the top of the
[721.64 - 727.80] P:1887.96 E:0.065006 |  crossbar. Yeah, just inside that left-hand side of the pitch, he comes inside right
[727.88 - 734.08] P:2003.47 E:0.067729 |  footed, just outside the penalty area, strikes really strong. It was quite central. Malinkovic,
[734.08 - 738.88] P:2042.30 E:0.081864 |  Savage just watched it, made sure he got two palms behind him, pushed it over. There we
[738.88 - 743.08] P:1963.27 E:0.081431 |  go, finally we have a little bit of action. Corner comes in from Foden, deep to Dooku,
[743.08 - 747.20] P:2047.97 E:0.092032 |  he's all on his own, he just took a poor touch, it wouldn't sit for him, couldn't get a shot
[747.20 - 752.48] P:1978.17 E:0.070679 |  away cleanly and it's cleared. But that was a huge opportunity at the back post. Big chance,
[752.48 - 756.44] P:1990.31 E:0.083450 |  big deep cross to the back post. And Dooku's there and it's one of those, I'm thinking
[756.48 - 759.92] P:2029.99 E:0.091672 |  is he going to head it, is he going to volley it? But it always lands on his chest so he's
[759.92 - 766.00] P:2036.42 E:0.068107 |  stuck to decide what to do. He takes his touch, it's a poor one. We have a little bit of
[766.00 - 771.28] P:1968.35 E:0.082211 |  concern here, an injury possibly, but it was a big chance for City. Yeah, Rasmus Hoyland
[771.28 - 779.64] P:1909.06 E:0.047813 |  is hobbling around. Just feeling his, I think it's his left leg, he's feeling at the moment,
[779.64 - 785.40] P:1892.48 E:0.069528 |  but he's on his feet and he's moving around. So no treatment required for Hoyland, Manchester
[785.44 - 790.76] P:1856.52 E:0.079689 |  City back on the ball. First real opportunity has come the way of the home side with that
[790.76 - 795.32] P:1831.41 E:0.076334 |  Reinder's effort and then from the resulting corner, Dooku with the opportunity at the
[795.32 - 803.96] P:1856.98 E:0.056753 |  back post and it's Dooku now who tries to spin away past Politano. No way past though,
[803.96 - 806.72] P:1821.24 E:0.078021 |  Manchester City keep a hold of the ball, it is going to be a free kick, I thought the
[806.72 - 810.44] P:1778.80 E:0.092588 |  referee was going to let it play on there because City were in possession but he does
[810.48 - 817.00] P:1840.57 E:0.058014 |  stop the play. The German referee, Felix Weier, who refereed the Europa League final
[817.00 - 824.72] P:1809.08 E:0.049067 |  between Manchester United and Tottenham last season. So Rasmus Hoyland will be acquainted
[824.72 - 831.28] P:1787.09 E:0.063632 |  with him in different colours nowadays. Hoyland as Donoruma launches it long looking for
[831.28 - 837.22] P:1849.17 E:0.064484 |  Halland but beaten to it. MacTomany now heads it back to his captain, De Lorenzo and De
[837.62 - 843.22] P:1944.20 E:0.063366 |  Lorenzo is going to be forced back to the goalkeeper. Manchester City pressing high,
[843.22 - 850.58] P:1851.06 E:0.071651 |  Foden trying to get on the end of the pass out. That was very close but Napoli and Buongiorno
[850.58 - 855.34] P:1872.67 E:0.075902 |  able to just get it away and now Napoli come forward. Did you think he was getting on the
[855.34 - 860.10] P:1834.92 E:0.083770 |  end of that one there? The goalkeeper passes it right across the face, Foden almost got it,
[860.10 - 864.70] P:1958.29 E:0.077928 |  I've got to say it's perfect. Great ball out to the left for Spinitzola and Napoli coming forward,
[864.74 - 869.42] P:1993.13 E:0.097481 |  cuts inside really well into the penalty area. He's turned again and now it's left footed across
[869.42 - 874.62] P:2029.89 E:0.081592 |  and this time Casanova gets the block in but brilliant play from the left back. He's still
[874.62 - 878.94] P:2113.70 E:0.096263 |  got it edge of the area and now goes left foot shot deep looking for Anguisa, gets his head on
[878.94 - 883.42] P:2032.99 E:0.088159 |  it, knocks it back towards the penalty spot but Rodri is there to take it off MacTomany's toes
[883.42 - 888.70] P:2022.96 E:0.080682 |  and now Manchester City can launch an attack through Dockle over the halfway line. He's looking
[888.70 - 893.34] P:2045.69 E:0.076085 |  for options on the right-hand side. He's going to check back and play the ball to Reinders who
[893.34 - 897.58] P:1966.86 E:0.085173 |  now sweeps it over to this right-hand side to Casanova but Casanova found himself in a little
[897.58 - 901.66] P:1756.74 E:0.085604 |  bit of bother there up against Spinitzola. Yeah he got twisted up but he recovered well.
[903.58 - 907.66] P:1840.87 E:0.075335 |  Looking for Halland and there's a foot goes in there from Bukema but Manchester City keep
[907.66 - 913.82] P:1845.90 E:0.075363 |  hold of it. Now Halland to Bernardo Silva right side of the penalty area to Foden, Casanova,
[913.82 - 919.50] P:1825.52 E:0.080079 |  Foden, Manchester City playing with it just short passes just outside the penalty area trying to
[919.50 - 926.38] P:1807.65 E:0.073221 |  create that space to hurt Napoli but every Napoli player is back there between the ball
[926.38 - 932.70] P:1922.28 E:0.085553 |  and the goal. So now Manchester City try from the left, Dockle again he's got two Napoli players
[932.70 - 939.34] P:1920.72 E:0.079848 |  to beat. He's just dragging the ball with his right foot decides to go back. So now Guardiola
[939.98 - 944.22] P:1850.45 E:0.091435 |  moves to the right-hand side and Manchester City are going to have to be patient tonight because
[944.30 - 954.06] P:1758.90 E:0.054068 |  Antonio Conte sets his team up very well, hard to break down, organised and Manchester City
[954.94 - 959.42] P:1655.65 E:0.085546 |  will have to find a way to unlock it. Just watch the manager now, he's demanding all the time,
[959.42 - 963.74] P:1844.10 E:0.078410 |  he's non-stop, he's just been pushing him into positions. Waiting for the mistake which has
[963.74 - 969.26] P:1706.83 E:0.079093 |  happened and Guisa picking up the loose pass and now Napoli in possession but in their defensive
[969.26 - 974.38] P:1631.18 E:0.071593 |  third out to Dillarengo on the right-hand side he's got Polatano ahead of him and that little
[974.38 - 978.62] P:1841.16 E:0.098135 |  ball inside to Huyland but Dillarengo is looking for a free kick which he's not going to get you
[979.42 - 983.10] P:1699.32 E:0.100127 |  saw you look at that one Michael. Yeah I thought Dockle would call to him he was disappointed
[983.66 - 988.46] P:1935.43 E:0.068057 |  but he's got a react it's gone, here he is he's under pressure. Dockle
[990.62 - 995.90] P:1838.74 E:0.093276 |  now to Reinders, Reinders with the ball across headed clear but only as far as Diaz who's got
[995.98 - 1001.90] P:1941.10 E:0.087344 |  Vardal Fort support, 13 minutes gone here at the Etihad and this Champions League tie between
[1001.90 - 1008.86] P:1761.81 E:0.092540 |  Manchester City and Napoli. We still await the opening goal, Manchester City though with the first
[1009.50 - 1015.74] P:1765.69 E:0.093706 |  attempts on target and on goal it came from Reinders and it was a save tipped over the bar
[1015.74 - 1025.66] P:1771.39 E:0.070291 |  by Malinkovic Savic, it's as close as we've come. Napoli setting up in a defensive style at the moment
[1026.78 - 1031.74] P:1910.64 E:0.084426 |  but Tom only just dropped in really deep just as a little screen he's trying to go inside but he
[1031.74 - 1036.30] P:1900.74 E:0.088038 |  knows he's got to shuffle across cushion off not the out ball because he won't go too far
[1036.30 - 1041.58] P:1914.85 E:0.067806 |  they're making sure the back line can see why he's got to be certain they don't want to get counter
[1041.58 - 1046.62] P:1900.15 E:0.078629 |  attacked. Dockle left edge of the penalty area, drags it round to the byline tries to get the
[1046.62 - 1051.58] P:2056.03 E:0.087510 |  cross in does but it hits the top of the net and it will be another corner to Manchester City
[1052.06 - 1056.86] P:1905.83 E:0.074588 |  and there has been a goal in the eight o'clock kickoffs in the Champions League it's come at
[1056.86 - 1062.86] P:1988.48 E:0.087306 |  Frankfurt it's gone the way of Galatasaray so Frankfurt know Galatasaray won all the rest of
[1062.86 - 1067.58] P:2107.09 E:0.079264 |  the eight o'clock kickoffs goalless if you want to listen to Newcastle Barcelona you can do over
[1067.58 - 1072.54] P:2011.79 E:0.096951 |  on Radio Five Live and BBC sounds but here on Five Live Sports Extra it is Manchester City
[1072.54 - 1077.42] P:1955.91 E:0.084371 |  against Napoli and it's folding with the corner in towards the penalty spot, Vardal is there
[1077.74 - 1084.22] P:2002.20 E:0.066023 |  and Harland they both tried to attack it there was a head that got on the end of it but it
[1084.22 - 1091.74] P:1876.66 E:0.066211 |  looped over Malinkovic Savic's bar and harmlessly out. He went to attack it didn't he quick Harland
[1092.78 - 1099.34] P:1932.91 E:0.061909 |  and Giorno does very well gets close to him, comes in out, envisions everybody
[1099.98 - 1107.98] P:1826.77 E:0.062132 |  and all our monitors what does he think? Where next? These managers have to adapt and change in play
[1109.02 - 1113.66] P:1903.77 E:0.092089 |  City are really high-line trying to squeeze the pitchers Napoli try to play out trying to find
[1114.38 - 1118.38] P:1892.28 E:0.089109 |  little combinations they haven't really got any possession at this moment this is the first
[1118.38 - 1123.26] P:1880.83 E:0.075632 |  little bit and it's a lovely little touch inside to McTomney who's now able for the first time to
[1123.26 - 1128.78] P:1987.20 E:0.078792 |  open his legs and drive towards City's forced wide to spin it solo though inside Manchester City's
[1128.78 - 1135.26] P:1884.51 E:0.067230 |  half and he's got LeBotka the little linchpin in Napoli's midfield he just ticks over doesn't he
[1135.26 - 1142.22] P:1831.27 E:0.081377 |  weights draws he can play diagonally little frame that little holding midfield player just so much
[1142.22 - 1148.38] P:1971.29 E:0.066141 |  and necessarily always appreciated. Paulitano looking to get the cross in it's deflected
[1148.38 - 1154.94] P:1928.33 E:0.063870 |  it's gone out for a corner Napoli's first set piece of the evening they will try and hurt
[1154.94 - 1164.54] P:1774.47 E:0.069121 |  Manchester City from the corner but LeBotka an interesting midfield setup that Napoli have this
[1164.54 - 1169.66] P:1710.21 E:0.090224 |  season there were sort of questions as to where Kevin De Bruyne would fit in when he arrived would
[1170.70 - 1175.58] P:1697.00 E:0.091094 |  one of the others have to drop out and McTomney and then Guisara, Paulitano has been able to fit them
[1175.58 - 1181.90] P:1669.69 E:0.089181 |  all in. Well he moved McTomney out to that left hand side which created the space which is very
[1182.22 - 1186.46] P:1686.70 E:0.088956 |  brave when you've got the player of the year to move him from somewhere he didn't so well referee
[1186.46 - 1191.58] P:1858.40 E:0.074881 |  just stopping a little bit of play kind of rumour under a little bit of contact and pushing him
[1191.58 - 1200.54] P:1938.70 E:0.058046 |  around Hoylund on his toes. Big smile from Hoylund as the referee gives him a little ticking off
[1200.54 - 1205.42] P:1960.98 E:0.087085 |  they're still at it though but in comes the corner it's towards Donorima's goal and he's spilled
[1205.98 - 1209.50] P:2065.63 E:0.091725 |  the touch there is an offside flag up though and it was a wicked delivery
[1210.46 - 1215.50] P:2033.62 E:0.087691 |  swirling towards Donorima's goal there was a touch on it I think it might have been Anguisa
[1215.50 - 1222.94] P:1815.60 E:0.054611 |  with the touch Donorima spilled it but the flag up and that's up at little scare perhaps
[1222.94 - 1229.66] P:1871.13 E:0.063099 |  for Manchester City. Yeah you're just lucky to jump onto that back post the camera just gets
[1230.30 - 1235.18] P:1848.07 E:0.083867 |  his head on it down into the ground in front of the goalkeeper reaction save as he pushes away
[1235.18 - 1240.22] P:1921.14 E:0.074338 |  Hoylund great spot from the official by the way in an offside position very quick with the
[1240.22 - 1245.58] P:1868.53 E:0.078524 |  flag to him the rebounder to went in comfortable save not an outstanding one quite routine but
[1245.58 - 1251.34] P:1937.38 E:0.072381 |  he's done his job. Well the camera it was with the header who scored in his debut at the weekend
[1251.34 - 1260.30] P:1800.28 E:0.050626 |  against Fiorentina signed from Bologna in the summer so Napoli. Yeah big fee as well 31 million
[1260.30 - 1265.58] P:1806.39 E:0.073633 |  euros I believe so that tells you the intent of what they expect of him he took some time to
[1266.86 - 1271.90] P:1815.18 E:0.074724 |  drop in and they're going tight and aggressive press Napoli now trying to push City into the long
[1271.90 - 1277.02] P:1933.66 E:0.078490 |  ball but I think that's dangerous at times because Haaland will go one for one. And now Foden's looking
[1277.02 - 1282.38] P:1984.59 E:0.099071 |  for Haaland the challenge comes in from Dilaranzo he's taken out Haaland on the edge of the penalty
[1282.38 - 1289.74] P:1977.05 E:0.085823 |  area outside the box Haaland is furious the referee has not given anything Dilaranzo's hurt
[1289.74 - 1296.06] P:1952.56 E:0.095225 |  himself and now the referee is wandering over Dilaranzo still on the ground Haaland is asking
[1296.78 - 1301.58] P:1931.86 E:0.102168 |  for a red card. He's asking his hands went up which we don't like to see but when a player
[1301.58 - 1305.82] P:1977.54 E:0.096484 |  lies down when he's challenged he thinks he's guilty I said you don't leave him one by one
[1305.82 - 1312.06] P:1991.31 E:0.074185 |  it creates problems Foden just pushes it into a space Dilaranzo gets it all wrong does he touch him
[1312.62 - 1317.50] P:2080.51 E:0.087731 |  does he get any ball we get a nice little look me initial thought he doesn't the studs just don't
[1317.50 - 1323.74] P:1848.73 E:0.080696 |  touch it the contact comes around big big decision big moment of the game just onto
[1323.74 - 1329.34] P:1844.26 E:0.092439 |  early Haaland's right foot as he misses it that right foot comes around Haaland's waving for cards
[1330.54 - 1335.82] P:1874.68 E:0.085507 |  the referee now the weight every city player was asking and demanding and when they get another
[1335.82 - 1340.94] P:1963.18 E:0.080201 |  look he thinks he's touched it but we couldn't see that could we we couldn't see it Christian
[1340.94 - 1346.22] P:1893.09 E:0.097765 |  Dinger another German official is the video assistant referee this evening it won't be a penalty it's
[1346.22 - 1351.34] P:1930.94 E:0.086679 |  outside the area will it be a red card that is the question we are getting the potential
[1351.34 - 1358.06] P:1871.81 E:0.079340 |  red card check on the big screens here at the Etihad I don't think there is any doubt that this
[1358.06 - 1363.98] P:1906.41 E:0.090918 |  is a red see the Lorenzo right he stays down and he's holding his leg he's thinking I've not really
[1363.98 - 1369.74] P:1939.74 E:0.096766 |  got much of an areas to the money that was the biggest tell of an experienced player thinking
[1369.74 - 1374.14] P:1955.66 E:0.099130 |  oh I'm in trouble then he thinks he's got away with it it's so close it's a difficult one for
[1374.14 - 1378.86] P:1890.55 E:0.082285 |  the official because it's round the other side off to the monitor what we've seen here you go a nice
[1378.86 - 1385.74] P:1858.91 E:0.071533 |  still for you yeah it's never fair I think when they start in a still but he will see the full
[1385.74 - 1392.14] P:1867.05 E:0.073653 |  movement and Felix via the German official he's already shown two red cards and the three games
[1392.14 - 1401.58] P:1975.47 E:0.059883 |  he's officiated this season and will he show another one here there is the signal he goes to his
[1401.66 - 1409.74] P:2025.01 E:0.093255 |  back pocket the red card comes out Napoli are down to 10 their captain Giovanni Dillarezzo is sent
[1409.74 - 1418.22] P:1951.99 E:0.079584 |  off we are 20 minutes into this Champions League tie and Napoli will have to play the rest of the
[1418.22 - 1423.82] P:1804.46 E:0.095037 |  game without their captain and down to 10 this is a huge moment I think what the turning point was
[1423.82 - 1428.22] P:1913.10 E:0.085868 |  is it looked like Erling Haaland wasn't going to get the ball but he's so quick he pushed it into
[1428.22 - 1433.34] P:1928.41 E:0.085467 |  the space the Lorenzo couldn't recover he decides to make the challenge because he thinks he'll get
[1433.34 - 1438.14] P:1869.51 E:0.084006 |  it and when we get another look as a player when you've been in that position you think you've got
[1438.14 - 1442.70] P:1958.59 E:0.086433 |  it your intention is not to foul he's very experienced understands it but we're talking
[1443.26 - 1449.50] P:1992.95 E:0.072559 |  the minimal of touches like on the edge of his studs could have been the difference and he'll
[1449.50 - 1455.90] P:1939.88 E:0.076834 |  say he might have just touched it but it's agonisingly close the ball doesn't move offline but that'll
[1455.90 - 1462.06] P:1872.38 E:0.069132 |  be the message from him Haaland as well steps across it contacting between from there a
[1462.06 - 1467.26] P:1839.87 E:0.083469 |  disappointed Lorenzo leaves the pitch and now an opportunity for Manchester City and you said in
[1467.26 - 1472.22] P:1850.10 E:0.090931 |  the build-up to that it's a dangerous play to try and allow Manchester City to go long to Haaland
[1472.22 - 1478.38] P:1910.92 E:0.078044 |  they did that the ball was one it fell though to Foden it's the second ball the loose ball Foden
[1478.38 - 1483.74] P:1934.10 E:0.077685 |  picks up plays that perfect pass into the path of Haaland who shows that great strength and pace to
[1483.74 - 1489.90] P:1997.12 E:0.076442 |  get round to Lorenzo he he tried all he could to get a foot on the ball but from the pictures it
[1489.90 - 1494.06] P:2003.86 E:0.081115 |  didn't look like he touched it at all and now Manchester City have a huge opportunity from a
[1494.06 - 1501.34] P:1991.80 E:0.065277 |  free kick just on the edge of the penalty area just to the left of the D and they're also playing
[1501.34 - 1508.30] P:2012.74 E:0.072625 |  against a team who are a man down so Manchester City with the opportunity now to make it even worse
[1509.10 - 1514.94] P:2024.74 E:0.076671 |  for the visitors Foden and Reinders the two standing over the free kick will it be the
[1514.94 - 1519.34] P:1998.87 E:0.091767 |  left foot of Foden the right foot of Reinders and it looks like it will be Reinders it's taking a
[1519.34 - 1524.54] P:1999.09 E:0.085150 |  deflection it's going to go out for a corner kick for Manchester City so it doesn't get worse for
[1524.54 - 1531.42] P:1909.12 E:0.077922 |  Napoli yet but the night has become a little bit longer yeah the same Reuben Diaz Nico O'Reilly
[1531.42 - 1537.98] P:1817.61 E:0.079254 |  just trying to block the line of the goalkeeper a good wall one behind it laying down activity
[1537.98 - 1542.14] P:1832.09 E:0.088946 |  on the Napoli bench he's going to make a change he probably has to with the area of the pitch
[1542.14 - 1547.58] P:1954.96 E:0.072447 |  but he's another opportunity for City corner comes in into the hands of Malinkovic Savicen
[1547.58 - 1552.62] P:1913.91 E:0.072610 |  now the goalkeeper will try and take a little bit of time calm it down because Napoli have been
[1553.50 - 1557.10] P:1952.16 E:0.089888 |  rocked here at the Etihad by that red card for their captain
[1558.78 - 1563.34] P:1834.47 E:0.074547 |  there's no rush with the message but he actually decides to go short full credit to them they
[1563.34 - 1568.62] P:1885.95 E:0.076351 |  want to play and keep the ball spin it's all are going long for Hoyland who's wrestling with Diaz and
[1569.42 - 1574.86] P:1931.20 E:0.079132 |  the loose ball latched on to by Silva who just knocks it back into the path off Guardiola
[1575.90 - 1584.54] P:1805.85 E:0.050648 |  and now Diaz out to O'Reilly into Napoli's half as Napoli do prepare to make a change
[1586.86 - 1592.30] P:1891.25 E:0.069339 |  but at the moment it is City looking to heap more misery yeah Polatino has just dropped down into a
[1592.30 - 1598.62] P:1800.73 E:0.075753 |  full back area Scott Midtomino after narrow off now the rigid four just in front and then wherever
[1598.62 - 1605.10] P:1906.88 E:0.071661 |  they can get Hoyland but we'll see what that substituting tails what's next very experienced
[1605.10 - 1611.58] P:1897.79 E:0.068318 |  manager we know but we'll not fancy this chance now with the situation they're in and Dock who
[1611.58 - 1620.14] P:1873.36 E:0.062619 |  going to the byline cutting it back but it is a Polatino who's there to clear it it's still with
[1620.14 - 1625.98] P:1912.26 E:0.055045 |  City though still on the edge of the area and Dock who just stops it going out right on the
[1625.98 - 1630.62] P:1911.06 E:0.095828 |  byline goes back to O'Reilly now the cross comes in there's Halland with a header and it's just over
[1630.62 - 1636.14] P:2017.43 E:0.094923 |  the top of the crossbar he's got his hands on his head he knows that that was a chance good ball
[1636.14 - 1642.54] P:1905.12 E:0.077347 |  in from the left hand side and Halland got contact just not quite able to keep it under the crossbar
[1643.10 - 1648.06] P:1851.00 E:0.083990 |  yeah good delivery so hard for Defender as he runs right across the ball's good
[1649.02 - 1655.10] P:1908.39 E:0.061639 |  and Giorno just trying to get his arm trying to stop it knows there's a good chance there for
[1655.10 - 1662.70] P:1950.56 E:0.069454 |  Halland but now a chance to rethink to wait I think a bit savage just now decides to go along and
[1662.70 - 1671.50] P:1947.74 E:0.055160 |  I'm going to see some activity very very shortly well it is Mathias Oliveira who is ready and waiting
[1671.50 - 1676.62] P:1872.99 E:0.074634 |  to come on for Napoli and now Forden plays it in behind looking for the run of Halland there's
[1676.62 - 1680.78] P:1966.26 E:0.090123 |  a little bit too much on that ball right idea from Forden it's gone all the way through though to
[1680.78 - 1688.14] P:1918.35 E:0.062763 |  my link of it savage but there was space there to play in behind Napoli and Forden tried to find the
[1688.14 - 1694.62] P:1829.00 E:0.055912 |  run of Halland but now Napoli come forward LeBocca spreads the ball from right to left to Spinat
[1694.62 - 1701.90] P:1919.99 E:0.071480 |  Sola back to De Bruyne orange flash of his boots and he's sprayed a beautiful crossfield ball right
[1701.90 - 1707.90] P:1908.91 E:0.075648 |  into the path of Polatano who just can't control and it goes out but that is a Dev Kevin De Bruyne
[1707.90 - 1712.22] P:1818.63 E:0.089821 |  pass who does he sacrifice there we're going to have a little look at it what he decided to do
[1712.22 - 1717.50] P:1948.39 E:0.104741 |  and this is a really really strange decision this is a brave manager to make this and we know
[1717.50 - 1722.62] P:1843.47 E:0.107700 |  Oliveira can go either left back or he might switch across but what a shame in the night that
[1722.62 - 1730.70] P:1923.25 E:0.096164 |  is actually a sacrifice for a red card it is Kevin De Bruyne whose name is being chanted around the
[1730.70 - 1739.42] P:1915.64 E:0.087239 |  Etihad all four stands are on their feet and clapping the man that they used to idolise here
[1740.62 - 1747.66] P:1869.31 E:0.075064 |  at the Etihad he has been the man sacrificed for Mathias Oliveira after the red card to Dilarenzo

[2149.82 - 2156.46] P:1903.78 E:0.064852 |  there back from Napoli towards the goalkeeper but Napoli have been able to get the ball
[2156.46 - 2161.50] P:2038.46 E:0.090723 |  beyond Manchester City's defence with Poletano the sliding challenge comes in for O'Reilly who's
[2161.50 - 2167.50] P:1938.17 E:0.068976 |  writhing around on the ground he's caught him you can tell he's caught him he apologised in this way
[2167.50 - 2171.98] P:1865.37 E:0.080662 |  we're having a little look Nico O'Reilly is just saying he's underneath him but
[2172.54 - 2177.90] P:1876.85 E:0.087515 |  he's getting another look does he leave it on him oh he does you know a little bit he's trying to say
[2177.98 - 2185.26] P:1777.85 E:0.065584 |  hasn't but for me it's a little bit of a straight leg it wasn't the cleanest of strides
[2185.82 - 2191.42] P:1806.13 E:0.073231 |  they might see it different Nico O'Reilly took the apology hasn't he he has he's slid in and
[2191.98 - 2201.66] P:1893.27 E:0.060399 |  Poletano as he is just catching his feet to run past him lands on his leg just around the knee area
[2201.66 - 2208.22] P:1847.03 E:0.067593 |  and there are many pundits I don't know if you're one of them Michael as the corner comes in straight
[2208.22 - 2212.46] P:2044.08 E:0.083737 |  into the hands of Donorima there are many pundits who say that you always know where your feet are
[2212.46 - 2217.02] P:1845.32 E:0.080020 |  going now I'm not suggesting anything by that there's many ex players who didn't know where feet were going
[2217.82 - 2221.82] P:1807.29 E:0.094470 |  that was my excuse for a few of the challenges anyway so do you think he left one on there
[2223.02 - 2230.14] P:1886.61 E:0.057776 |  he possibly could have got out the way of it that's what I would say I was he said it wasn't ideal
[2231.66 - 2237.82] P:1867.82 E:0.065310 |  though he is up he's still feeling that knee a little bit gingerly O'Reilly but he is up
[2237.82 - 2243.10] P:1833.75 E:0.053301 |  back under way on the ball now the 20 year old
[2246.94 - 2252.86] P:2065.98 E:0.065869 |  is making his first Champions League start tonight and the ball into Hallund and under pressure
[2254.70 - 2260.38] P:1886.01 E:0.051507 |  he was from Buongiorno but that was a dangerous little ball into the feet of Hallund
[2260.38 - 2264.78] P:1780.22 E:0.090557 |  Buongiorno did well you know got his foot wrapped it round because he realised once Hallund backs in
[2264.78 - 2270.78] P:1919.60 E:0.067471 |  it's hard to take it he just takes it into the forward areas and sitting just having a little
[2270.78 - 2277.82] P:1825.54 E:0.078103 |  look it's where the management team, Guardiola really good at finding solutions and overloads and
[2277.82 - 2283.98] P:1921.58 E:0.062210 |  putting the extra pressure on Guardiola with the cross left-footed and it's into the hands of
[2283.98 - 2289.90] P:1937.67 E:0.077969 |  Malinkovic Savage but Buongiorno got in the way a little bit and it's loose but it is with Napoli
[2289.90 - 2296.14] P:1903.07 E:0.076520 |  feet just driving out off their own penalty area and Guisa now on this right hand side he's able to
[2296.14 - 2303.02] P:1938.09 E:0.062604 |  put a foot on the ball and try and get something going again for Napoli who struggled since the
[2303.02 - 2309.18] P:1931.27 E:0.065159 |  red card since going down to 10 Malinkovic Savage goes long over the head of McTominay
[2309.18 - 2313.34] P:1905.47 E:0.075624 |  and straight onto the head of Guardiola now Manchester City they just have possession back
[2313.34 - 2320.14] P:1904.28 E:0.055114 |  again through Folden to Silva, Silva twisting turning looking for options he's got it from
[2320.14 - 2327.50] P:1983.24 E:0.056914 |  Reinders just outside the D and the edge of the penalty area he goes to Kasanov and to Diaz
[2328.38 - 2336.54] P:1964.24 E:0.067591 |  Reinders again, Sanoff and Diaz and Manchester City beginning to get the crowd behind them
[2336.70 - 2344.94] P:1987.33 E:0.052856 |  shots have come on City they've enjoyed the bulk of possession but the ball not in a threatening
[2344.94 - 2349.34] P:1927.45 E:0.081842 |  position but that's a good cross looking for Halland sliding in at the back post but
[2350.54 - 2354.70] P:1934.41 E:0.086565 |  it would have been an incredibly special finish if he'd been able to get on the end of that one
[2355.66 - 2361.26] P:1867.43 E:0.097748 |  did you bet against him I didn't want to see him loan for it I'm thinking those legs are so long
[2361.26 - 2368.06] P:1860.03 E:0.083358 |  seeing some great goals Reuben Diaz almost Kevin De Bruyne alike should I say towards that back post
[2368.70 - 2374.70] P:1891.51 E:0.087339 |  as Halland's big left foot dives forward towards that line to try and get some contact we've seen
[2374.70 - 2380.38] P:1881.09 E:0.071888 |  him get it before and squeeze it in certain post but too far on this occasion
[2382.70 - 2388.06] P:1934.44 E:0.080844 |  Dooku battling for the ball comes off at Napoli foot I think it was that Poletano it's out for
[2388.06 - 2394.78] P:1838.85 E:0.066587 |  a Manchester City thrown level with the left side of the penalty area which O'Reilly will take
[2395.74 - 2403.98] P:1817.65 E:0.035990 |  and now with Dooku back Vardiole Kasanov Silva
[2406.30 - 2410.86] P:1884.17 E:0.070334 |  how did Manchester City find a way through what is now really just become
[2411.82 - 2421.34] P:1894.45 E:0.059919 |  a wall of Napoli players Silva cross headed clear to the edge of the area shot comes in it saved Savic
[2421.98 - 2425.42] P:1996.37 E:0.082193 |  but to the feet of Dooku but the flag has gone up but that was a wicked strike
[2426.46 - 2431.82] P:2051.44 E:0.080845 |  from just outside the area Rodri testing the palms of Malinkovic Savic
[2432.70 - 2439.66] P:1870.01 E:0.070111 |  yeah great strikes edge of the area just waiting for chances as midfielders as defenders stepping
[2439.66 - 2444.86] P:1739.97 E:0.064933 |  forward and whether the offside really comes into play it's because it comes back into the path as
[2444.86 - 2452.70] P:1910.02 E:0.066809 |  Rodri strikes into the floor Malinkovic Savic just a real present palms it away and that flag goes up
[2452.70 - 2457.90] P:1804.91 E:0.089957 |  great to see him back getting minutes now Rodri that Ballendo winner we missed so much of him with
[2457.90 - 2464.30] P:1770.44 E:0.067513 |  that terrible injury it took a while to bring him back City certainly missed him it wasn't just him
[2464.30 - 2470.46] P:1846.68 E:0.073591 |  there was others Phil Ford and obvious reasons as well and just couldn't get to where he was the highs
[2471.98 - 2476.06] P:1950.54 E:0.094819 |  he's battling in there with Anguisa but it's Anguisa who's come out on top looking for the run of
[2476.06 - 2482.30] P:1994.66 E:0.091643 |  Hoyland just a little bit too much on the ball allowed Kasanov to get in and clear the ball for
[2482.30 - 2487.18] P:1890.39 E:0.080455 |  a Napoli throw and it was actually McTominay that was racing through onto that ball getting my
[2487.18 - 2493.02] P:1796.30 E:0.084165 |  man United X man United players mixed up could you tell there was the the booze from all the supporters
[2493.18 - 2497.34] P:1804.61 E:0.084037 |  McTominay just starts tries to pick the ball up for a throw and Anguisa does well in the middle
[2497.98 - 2503.50] P:2050.66 E:0.076514 |  and Kasanov just realises McTominay is quick he's powerful he's strong as he's strides into the
[2503.50 - 2510.62] P:1890.25 E:0.073011 |  area he takes no chances he clears it away goalkeeper back Donner on a very vocal telling him well done
[2511.90 - 2516.78] P:1857.83 E:0.065116 |  the throwing comes into the penalty area but City able to get it clear Scott McTominay actually has
[2516.78 - 2522.22] P:1880.84 E:0.072794 |  three victories here at the Etihad from his time at Manchester United it's going to be a really tough
[2522.22 - 2528.06] P:1886.03 E:0.074937 |  test to add to those three tonight with Napoli down to 10 but still they are very much in the
[2528.06 - 2533.42] P:1915.34 E:0.065638 |  game because we are still goalless despite Manchester City having the bulk of possession
[2534.78 - 2540.06] P:1847.77 E:0.079524 |  and having a couple of shots on goal nothing has really worried Malinkovic Savic in the Napoli goal
[2541.42 - 2547.50] P:1863.66 E:0.069501 |  halfside flag goes up against Hoyland but Manchester City will play on as Bernardo Silva just crosses

[2573.50 - 2578.30] P:1998.34 E:0.087502 |  O'Reilly he drops it back to cross it in and there's a little bit of a mix-up in the Napoli
[2578.30 - 2588.38] P:1986.17 E:0.058688 |  defence and Reinders almost got in it had to be cleared out by a Napoli boot for a corner as Reinders
[2588.38 - 2594.22] P:2105.68 E:0.082099 |  just tried to take it down and take it round and it was Bakema who got a foot in to just knock it

[2615.58 - 2620.94] P:1960.46 E:0.071972 |  has it and cuts out onto his right foot and now onto his right hand side where Silva floats it in
[2620.94 - 2625.74] P:2048.36 E:0.088541 |  towards the back post header comes in Malinkovic Savic again diving to his right to knock it out
[2625.74 - 2632.22] P:2043.75 E:0.088627 |  for another corner and it is again head and hands moment from Manchester City and this time is Nico
[2632.22 - 2637.98] P:2002.35 E:0.083667 |  O'Reilly who got a really good header onto the end of that lovely floated ball from Bernardo Silva
[2637.98 - 2643.50] P:2032.82 E:0.078134 |  Rose High just couldn't quite direct it as the corner comes in header again Malinkovic Savic
[2643.50 - 2648.30] P:1991.16 E:0.088593 |  down to his right and now the cross comes back in towards the back post Rodry is there it's fallen
[2648.30 - 2653.42] P:1913.66 E:0.097885 |  to the far side Bernardo Silva and now there's claim for a penalty and this shot comes in
[2653.42 - 2661.82] P:1945.90 E:0.074726 |  and absolutely takes out Spinatsola from close range it's Polatano who's down right on the
[2661.82 - 2668.46] P:1963.98 E:0.071945 |  edge of the area the shot canoned off his head from really close range from Kasanov but that was
[2668.46 - 2677.42] P:1816.01 E:0.058451 |  a real moment of panic for Napoli defensively as the ball came in from the corner Malinkovic
[2677.42 - 2683.26] P:1946.19 E:0.070891 |  Savic with a great save it came back in again and eventually when it fell to Kasanov the strike
[2683.26 - 2689.66] P:1902.82 E:0.050662 |  was vicious Polatano's head stopped it getting towards the goal yeah it's jumped up Polatano
[2689.66 - 2693.74] P:1937.49 E:0.090835 |  with a smile on his face I think the question whether he has been caught he stayed down he
[2693.74 - 2699.74] P:1800.12 E:0.074739 |  delayed he waited using that head injury but are we going to see a better performance Malinkovic
[2699.74 - 2705.58] P:1981.86 E:0.081341 |  Savic a double save and quick succession Jostko Vardiole headed down into the ground top save to
[2705.58 - 2711.90] P:1923.63 E:0.082812 |  the right also that Nico O'Reilly right in that corner also with that header City creating
[2711.90 - 2718.78] P:2005.94 E:0.080657 |  they're really pushing now shot comes in towards the far post from Vardiole and Malinkovic Savic was
[2719.34 - 2725.74] P:2009.81 E:0.078033 |  scrambling a little so glad to see it go just wide of his far post as Vardiole
[2726.38 - 2733.66] P:1876.19 E:0.054361 |  shouts a little cry of anguish as the ball skims past the left hand post that was a
[2733.66 - 2741.90] P:1898.64 E:0.068929 |  really good effort from Vardiole but still we await the opening goal three minutes of the 45
[2741.90 - 2749.10] P:1840.64 E:0.064758 |  left to play and it is still goalless but it is Manchester City asking older questions
[2750.38 - 2752.62] P:1790.50 E:0.081134 |  against the 10 men of Napoli
[2755.26 - 2760.62] P:1817.20 E:0.064130 |  as the ball is long looking for Hoyland it will go straight through to Donoruma
[2761.98 - 2768.06] P:1932.48 E:0.064981 |  Frankfurt have equalised against Galatasaray in the eight o'clock kickoff they're still
[2768.14 - 2771.98] P:1844.27 E:0.081253 |  goalless in the other three eight o'clock kickoffs earlier on club Bruges were four one winners
[2771.98 - 2778.94] P:1901.24 E:0.058509 |  against Monaco and they finished two a piece between Copenhagen and Laverkusen all the highlights
[2778.94 - 2786.30] P:1983.38 E:0.053283 |  of the Champions League available tonight on BBC one as Reinders tries to wriggle clear on the
[2786.30 - 2791.98] P:2005.48 E:0.071298 |  edge of the area doku prods it in but just can't quite find the run of his Dutch teammate
[2792.86 - 2797.66] P:1812.83 E:0.058701 |  who gives a right smile as the ball trickles out for a goal kick
[2800.06 - 2802.62] P:1877.13 E:0.072469 |  domination from City right from the start
[2804.62 - 2810.62] P:1900.94 E:0.068092 |  complete possession shots efforts at goal could have been a little bit more clinical early on
[2811.34 - 2815.74] P:1831.48 E:0.087919 |  in the first half but Napoli was stubborn they were organised they've waited and tried to delay
[2816.62 - 2822.54] P:1813.71 E:0.068078 |  City but since that red card on the 21st minute they've had to adapt because City
[2822.54 - 2827.82] P:1766.74 E:0.083506 |  are going all the way around different sides pushing it one by one putting the ball in the box
[2828.62 - 2834.70] P:1878.83 E:0.068702 |  not afraid to to go more direct we've seen this might be a little bit of a newer Manchester City
[2835.50 - 2840.78] P:1795.39 E:0.071538 |  isn't feeling the wider positions and so on to stay high and wide doki coming inside but
[2840.86 - 2843.58] P:1965.49 E:0.080370 |  we've got to make the pitch and stretch it as big as possible and
[2844.30 - 2848.54] P:1859.14 E:0.073192 |  the cost of the amount of time left this could be so difficult for Napoli to sustain it
[2849.50 - 2856.46] P:1920.16 E:0.083790 |  Crossfield ball from Rodri to Cassano ball in from Foden and it was Reinders who got on the
[2856.46 - 2862.22] P:1999.64 E:0.084497 |  end of it it was a delicious ball from Foden right into the path of Reinders he tried to flick
[2862.22 - 2867.42] P:2010.61 E:0.086456 |  the header beyond the link of its service just got too much on it and over the top of the bar it went
[2867.42 - 2872.94] P:1704.23 E:0.070479 |  you can see what he was trying to do but it doesn't test the goalkeeper and again that was an opening
[2872.94 - 2878.94] P:1934.73 E:0.070589 |  and Pete Guardiola puffs out his cheeks and turns away he thought there was an opening there but
[2878.94 - 2883.66] P:1905.85 E:0.076447 |  still he waits for the domination to result in an opening goal in this game
[2885.10 - 2889.50] P:1859.02 E:0.060647 |  yeah when you look at it as well I think he gets too much on the connection
[2889.50 - 2893.82] P:1786.65 E:0.074962 |  it's the little touch might have set the goalkeeper the wrong and that's a good battle in the middle
[2893.90 - 2900.70] P:1845.95 E:0.075859 |  referee asking him if he's decided against it Reinders comes clear with it four minutes added to
[2901.50 - 2910.06] P:1863.98 E:0.052759 |  the end of this first half so we have just reached the 45 for to play as Napoli have a rare moment
[2910.06 - 2915.66] P:1843.22 E:0.066428 |  of possession Politanal going down the right hand side he's got very little support and Guisa offers
[2915.66 - 2922.14] P:1920.18 E:0.072331 |  some inside and now Napoli players are able to catch up with play to Oliveira the substitute
[2922.30 - 2928.14] P:1898.21 E:0.071291 |  came on when Dillarengo was sent off came on for Kevin De Bruyne it was the former Manchester
[2928.14 - 2933.34] P:1787.71 E:0.076203 |  City man sacrifices the ball spread over to that right hand side Politanal now now wearing the
[2933.34 - 2940.06] P:1874.55 E:0.058248 |  captain's arm band drops it inside and here's mcdomany into the area back to Politanal
[2941.58 - 2945.82] P:1851.16 E:0.075379 |  and the cross oh god all right I thought the cross was going to come in he was
[2945.82 - 2951.74] P:1907.13 E:0.072559 |  between a cross and a shot there was LeBoccan nothing really happened and Manchester City able
[2951.74 - 2958.30] P:1823.94 E:0.052615 |  to get it clear the loose ball and Napoli if they're going to get anything from this game they need
[2958.30 - 2966.22] P:1787.86 E:0.051795 |  to find a way to be more clinical to make those passes in the in Manchester City's half count
[2966.22 - 2970.86] P:1874.73 E:0.063774 |  because they've very rarely been up there I tell you what the need they just need to see out these
[2970.86 - 2976.94] P:1859.38 E:0.064251 |  last three or four minutes get the manager to set them up get a breather concentration levels
[2976.94 - 2982.94] P:1898.02 E:0.089487 |  got to be so high so difficult everyone's just got to slot in you've got to pull and now all the
[2982.94 - 2989.58] P:2111.28 E:0.081184 |  gaps shuffle across one little area where somebody doesn't do the job city will find and exploit it
[2991.66 - 2996.06] P:2188.14 E:0.079724 |  Rodry pass along the ground Diaz right in front of the goal thought about the shot moved out to
[2996.06 - 3000.70] P:2075.76 E:0.085148 |  the right hand side though for Silva now drives into the penalty area chops onto his right foot
[3000.70 - 3006.22] P:1954.83 E:0.096189 |  back onto his left now lays it down beautifully for Reindersen I thought that was going in pass
[3006.22 - 3011.18] P:1947.94 E:0.094150 |  Malinkovic Savage how did he end up getting his foot on that while there are celebrations from
[3011.18 - 3016.06] P:1912.15 E:0.087266 |  Politanos so my view was blocked a little but I assume he got a foot on it took the pace off the
[3016.06 - 3020.94] P:1920.49 E:0.084059 |  ball and Malinkovic Savage was able to just pick it up Reindersen it was brilliant seeing a replay
[3020.94 - 3025.26] P:1784.84 E:0.089660 |  now brilliant from Politanos the Reindersen effort was going to nestle in the bottom corner
[3025.26 - 3030.62] P:1961.13 E:0.077582 |  Politanos put out a foot stopped the ball almost dead and Malinkovic Savage just picked it up but
[3030.62 - 3035.50] P:1917.28 E:0.096271 |  by doing that he almost put it in the goal it was actually behind Malinkovic Savage and I thought
[3036.06 - 3041.74] P:1905.72 E:0.089517 |  that's an own goal the Bernardo Silva is so well chopping checking and then the ball heading towards
[3041.74 - 3046.78] P:1959.37 E:0.092300 |  that corner but they keep fighting they're giving everything for the manager and these supporters
[3046.78 - 3056.30] P:1936.92 E:0.079458 |  they've travelled a long way there's a foul it is a foul a foul on Doki and Manchester City
[3057.10 - 3060.46] P:1985.16 E:0.106800 |  win a free kick just on the left side off the penalty area
[3060.46 - 3065.58] P:1928.20 E:0.078646 |  Politanos arguing his case though well because they've just let a different one off
[3066.22 - 3071.66] P:1917.41 E:0.079737 |  that they didn't have there's not much contact at all he steps into it there's three or four
[3071.66 - 3077.58] P:1843.62 E:0.082881 |  suits come forward from that Natalie Bench but just getting another look it's behind Malinkovic
[3077.58 - 3081.66] P:1942.24 E:0.092270 |  Savage if it had dived a little bit more spectacularly it would have looked more like one of those
[3081.66 - 3086.46] P:1883.29 E:0.085963 |  David Siemens saves where he's behind him but he was quite safe he he could have made it better
[3086.46 - 3093.10] P:1869.45 E:0.074811 |  for the cameras but he's going so well he didn't need to Politanos celebrating like he'd scored a goal
[3093.98 - 3099.50] P:2146.55 E:0.079558 |  blocking that shot but very nearly putting it into back of his own net Malinkovic Savage I think
[3099.50 - 3103.02] P:2066.06 E:0.097377 |  should have been the one celebrating as the free kick comes in short it's gone wide in the post
[3103.74 - 3109.10] P:1988.90 E:0.065472 |  and I think it was Roger who got the final touch on that one and it will be an appellate
[3110.06 - 3120.30] P:1880.97 E:0.050617 |  goal kick but yeah Malinkovic Savage certainly saving the blushes of Politanos as the Napoli fans behind
[3121.50 - 3127.34] P:1885.78 E:0.074513 |  his goal continue to support their team their arms are raised out that's interesting that peps just
[3127.34 - 3133.02] P:1880.80 E:0.076498 |  saying come on everybody let's get going let's get behind did you see that he's just said it's a
[3133.10 - 3139.26] P:1922.14 E:0.088046 |  little bit it does feel a little flat touch quiet because it's been so dominated by City that
[3139.98 - 3144.54] P:1914.62 E:0.100550 |  they've just rolled the ball around control it they'll be thinking how's your not score the manager
[3144.54 - 3150.46] P:1966.49 E:0.076182 |  with all the possession all the chances some great entertainment some great movement but
[3150.46 - 3156.62] P:2001.76 E:0.079313 |  Napoli side who've been extremely strong have been extremely organised and demanding from each
[3156.62 - 3161.90] P:1956.97 E:0.079784 |  other but it's been a good first half it has been a good first half we haven't had any goals but
[3161.98 - 3167.82] P:2010.84 E:0.073056 |  certainly Manchester City have absolutely dominated they've had the best opportunities Malinkovic
[3167.82 - 3175.18] P:1988.92 E:0.075826 |  Savage has been forced into a number of saves including one from his own player but he has been
[3175.18 - 3181.98] P:2008.17 E:0.071640 |  impenetrable in this first half Malinkovic Savage in just his second appearance for Napoli but the
[3181.98 - 3189.34] P:1956.94 E:0.076358 |  game really turned in the 20th minute went Dilarenzo took down Haaland denying the obvious goal
[3189.34 - 3197.18] P:1939.96 E:0.065630 |  scoring opportunity and after a quick look at the monitor referee Felix Vier brandished the red
[3197.18 - 3203.58] P:1961.86 E:0.068949 |  card and the Napoli captain's night was over Kevin de Bruyne the unfortunate man that was
[3204.54 - 3210.94] P:1947.87 E:0.083900 |  taken off for the substitution for the reshuffle by Antonio Conte but Napoli have been organised
[3210.94 - 3216.78] P:1928.58 E:0.056222 |  they have been stubborn and they have certainly showed all of the attributes you would expect
[3216.78 - 3221.74] P:1730.28 E:0.078961 |  from an Antonio Conte side. You just see the demands from the manager he's not stopped I think
[3221.74 - 3227.26] P:1810.15 E:0.084090 |  he's he's ran and covered so much ground just across that technical area organising moving
[3227.26 - 3233.10] P:1861.46 E:0.082781 |  people around looking and seeing where spaces are shouting on to make sure they close them up
[3233.10 - 3237.98] P:1777.61 E:0.082402 |  it was a big big decision for him to take Kevin de Bruyne off because he knows he could have that
[3237.98 - 3243.50] P:1849.09 E:0.080341 |  special touch something to give him that winner but the long period it probably was a correct
[3243.50 - 3247.26] P:1736.36 E:0.087080 |  decision because they're going to need everybody's legs and de Bruyne is not necessarily the one
[3247.26 - 3252.62] P:1834.06 E:0.074586 |  for legs he's the one with that wonderful right foot who can do things nobody else can
[3252.62 - 3256.14] P:1890.56 E:0.080079 |  they've been stubborn they've been organised as we've said my link of his savage looks like he's
[3256.14 - 3261.26] P:1872.79 E:0.071748 |  having the game of his life looks so comfortable he's took the pressure off with some certain crosses
[3261.26 - 3266.54] P:1832.82 E:0.071516 |  that have come cross could save down to the right hand side but City have looked good they look like
[3266.54 - 3272.14] P:1705.87 E:0.077104 |  they're in their stride they look like they've they create dominating moving the ball around but
[3272.22 - 3276.78] P:1792.25 E:0.073119 |  you've got to find an answer you've got to find a breakthrough and now in half time that's what
[3276.78 - 3282.06] P:1919.84 E:0.081210 |  Pat will be doing it will indeed because at the break here at the Etihad it is Manchester City
[3282.06 - 3287.10] P:1990.88 E:0.074174 |  0 Napoli 0 and we will now rejoin five live for half-time.
[3287.10 - 3291.82] P:1855.66 E:0.093501 |  In this match to get the result they needed to go into the main stage of the Champions League for
[3291.82 - 3297.58] P:1864.48 E:0.088752 |  the very first time alongside Arsenal and Chelsea that draw takes place tomorrow it's a 3-1 aggregate
[3297.58 - 3301.66] P:1905.36 E:0.084008 |  win tonight though it's finished 3-0 to an impressive Manchester United.
[3301.66 - 3306.06] P:1885.03 E:0.091230 |  It's going to super league both Hull clubs in action tonight but it could be a big evening for
[3306.06 - 3309.34] P:1888.74 E:0.089496 |  both in slightly different ways Sharon Short are watching KR.
[3310.06 - 3314.22] P:1708.78 E:0.088012 |  Yeah and it's taken time but Hull KR have finally got their noses in front in this one they've got a
[3314.22 - 3319.18] P:1858.45 E:0.085509 |  10 point lead at the break 16 points to six and it was Warrington who started this one the stronger
[3319.18 - 3324.06] P:1893.83 E:0.091669 |  with a try from Josh Thulis and then an effort from Kai Taylor here ruled out for obstruction
[3324.06 - 3328.78] P:1726.91 E:0.093140 |  eventually momentum turned towards Hull Kingston Rovers to the relief of the fans when Tyrone
[3328.78 - 3333.18] P:1842.01 E:0.082472 |  may scored you could almost hear that pressure cooker just being released a little bit.
[3333.18 - 3337.98] P:1538.53 E:0.099132 |  Now a boothers followed up with a double both with lovely moves across out wide for him to score
[3337.98 - 3343.02] P:1638.67 E:0.091113 |  Rhys Martin has converted two of the three so Rovers at the moment still on track for that
[3343.02 - 3347.02] P:1717.99 E:0.088271 |  league leader's shield they lead at half time Hull KR 16 Warrington 6.
[3347.82 - 3352.62] P:1922.93 E:0.097522 |  Meanwhile the other side of Hull are not in their playoff chances much good at the moment they're
[3352.62 - 3360.38] P:1938.95 E:0.081389 |  at half time as well and they are trailing Catalan by 14 points to 12 so Isaac Hayden is with us
[3360.38 - 3367.10] P:1940.18 E:0.092693 |  Dion Dublin is at St James's Park alongside John Murray and you'd agree with Dion would you Isaac that
[3367.10 - 3370.38] P:1852.24 E:0.095022 |  in a game of few chances Newcastle had the better ones?
[3371.34 - 3376.86] P:1881.85 E:0.106281 |  Yeah I'd agree with that I think Barcelona agree into the game sort of 10-15 minutes towards the
[3376.86 - 3382.22] P:1810.18 E:0.110715 |  end of the first half sustained pressure really well and obviously we knew they were going to
[3382.22 - 3386.54] P:1823.69 E:0.109162 |  probably have more possession in Newcastle but I think in transition like I said before the game
[3387.34 - 3392.46] P:1883.07 E:0.102732 |  was key and I thought a langer especially in the first 20-25 minutes was electric and
[3392.46 - 3396.14] P:1893.96 E:0.083080 |  caused all sorts of problems and another day Barnes could have finished that and it could
[3396.14 - 3401.74] P:1769.52 E:0.076377 |  be a different game. I was going to say to you would that be it's a bit simplistic I suppose but
[3401.74 - 3404.70] P:1803.51 E:0.098994 |  that would that be the halftime message to get the ball to a langer ball?
[3405.90 - 3410.62] P:1840.27 E:0.089204 |  Yeah I mean I think I think second half the substitutions would play a big part in the game
[3410.62 - 3415.34] P:1772.02 E:0.085492 |  I think with World of Marder possibly coming on I think Murphy as well who's again started this
[3415.34 - 3420.22] P:1725.35 E:0.087904 |  season almost as he finished last season in very good form I think that could make the difference
[3420.22 - 3427.18] P:1862.65 E:0.073947 |  today. It was a great move wasn't it Dion for for that best chance which a langer set up
[3427.74 - 3432.78] P:1913.62 E:0.094316 |  for Harvey Barnes, Antti Gordon tried to hold his run tried to hold his run was still off side
[3432.78 - 3435.66] P:1845.65 E:0.089634 |  and yet a langer running from deep got on to Trippier's ball.
[3435.74 - 3441.66] P:1878.82 E:0.080947 |  Yeah and I think that's what that's what they'll look to I mean I just feel that Antti
[3441.66 - 3446.70] P:2004.41 E:0.089761 |  Lange with the ball at his feet he's not trying to do anything special he just wants to get the
[3446.70 - 3452.06] P:1947.04 E:0.094143 |  ball into a dangerous area and then he'll deliver it to whoever's there he'll expect people to be
[3452.06 - 3456.94] P:1970.65 E:0.092120 |  there at the moment Barnes has been there and Gordon's been there Barnes should have scored
[3456.94 - 3462.22] P:1938.70 E:0.084249 |  yes it was a good save by the foot of the keeper but they should be one up and I said it before
[3462.22 - 3467.18] P:1943.63 E:0.088452 |  the game you cannot keep missing these chances against a football team like Barcelona and you
[3467.18 - 3473.74] P:1886.93 E:0.072602 |  can't do it you have to put the ball in the back of the net. Is it is it too simplistic again to say
[3474.54 - 3481.18] P:1865.57 E:0.073679 |  that an out and out strike would have finished it? No it's not it's fact it's fact and I do
[3481.18 - 3485.02] P:1893.77 E:0.105461 |  believe if they had a centre forward playing tonight he would have scored one of those goals
[3485.02 - 3490.78] P:1908.65 E:0.098068 |  what happens Shappers is the the the chance comes around and the mindset's very different
[3491.34 - 3496.78] P:1888.44 E:0.100987 |  if you're a centre forward you've done it thousands and thousands of times you know what kind of
[3496.78 - 3501.34] P:1839.41 E:0.102063 |  finish you have to use and you use it a lot of the time if you're not that kind of player
[3501.34 - 3506.30] P:1909.02 E:0.098948 |  you're choosing the finish as the ball's coming towards you so you're thinking about your finish
[3506.30 - 3509.58] P:1814.67 E:0.095085 |  when you shouldn't be thinking about your finish. What would you have done gone back and cross?
[3509.58 - 3511.34] P:1824.31 E:0.115564 |  I'd have been running back on my knees I'd have scored.
[3514.22 - 3518.70] P:1819.61 E:0.099601 |  That's but your finish would have gone back across the keeper presumably. Yeah my life
[3518.70 - 3522.70] P:1870.64 E:0.096305 |  yeah what I would have done what happens Shappers sometimes in those situations is you
[3522.70 - 3527.02] P:1848.16 E:0.104460 |  you can see the ball coming and then the last minute you take your eye off the ball
[3527.02 - 3531.50] P:1837.25 E:0.102592 |  and you look to see where the ball's going to go like a golf shot and therefore you don't connect
[3531.50 - 3536.14] P:1846.00 E:0.106227 |  with it how you should you don't even look at the goal you know where the goal is you use the white
[3536.14 - 3540.78] P:1883.02 E:0.097233 |  lines on the pitch to tell you where the goal is it's not going to move get good connection
[3540.78 - 3545.98] P:1882.03 E:0.087384 |  and then celebrate when you hear the ball rippin. I think because of the surfaces Dion I'm not sure
[3545.98 - 3551.42] P:1774.15 E:0.107903 |  knee slides were a thing when when you were scoring goals. I wouldn't be able to get up I wouldn't
[3551.42 - 3556.22] P:1777.21 E:0.102344 |  be able to get up at the floor after a knee slide. Just stay on your feet put your arms in the air
[3556.22 - 3559.90] P:1882.21 E:0.105571 |  and celebrate that's what you used to do back in the day. Should you have scored Isaac?
[3562.06 - 3566.94] P:1850.11 E:0.077752 |  Yeah it's one of those ones where he's said like Dion said it's kind of coming to him quite quickly
[3566.94 - 3571.50] P:1947.11 E:0.093568 |  he's taken his after ball ever so slightly and then as said he probably should be going back
[3571.50 - 3576.62] P:1968.29 E:0.083376 |  across the goal here but I think Gordon's chance the very first chance early on is I think he's
[3576.62 - 3580.86] P:1932.91 E:0.086876 |  gone with his wrong foot there I think if he goes with his left as it's coming across and just gets
[3580.86 - 3585.82] P:1828.48 E:0.090050 |  on target and uses the pace of the ball I think that was probably you know arguably even a better
[3585.82 - 3591.82] P:1893.00 E:0.083005 |  chance really. Isaac Dion for the time being thank you very much second half on the way then from

[3811.50 - 3817.98] P:1787.56 E:0.097554 |  The sixth day here in Tokyo, a wonderful evening session. We had wind and rain, but it didn't
[3817.98 - 3823.90] P:1700.31 E:0.092946 |  dampen the enthusiasm of the fans or the world-class performances. Plenty of Brits in action. We'll talk
[3823.90 - 3830.54] P:1776.28 E:0.095573 |  about them shortly, but we have to start with the women's 400 metre final. Sydney McLaughlin-Levrona,
[3830.54 - 3837.74] P:1759.01 E:0.088858 |  47.78 seconds, the second fastest athlete of all time. It was a final, Alison, where Amber
[3837.74 - 3843.26] P:1764.10 E:0.090990 |  Anning ran great. She finished fifth like she did at the Paris Olympics last year, but the top three
[3843.26 - 3851.18] P:1750.82 E:0.081903 |  were a different class today. Certainly the top one was. I mean, what we saw was phenomenal. 68,000
[3851.18 - 3856.54] P:1704.49 E:0.086103 |  full in the stadium, and I think the one person who couldn't believe it was Sydney McLaughlin-Levrona.
[3856.54 - 3862.22] P:1798.57 E:0.094336 |  She went down onto a haunches, shaking her head. I cannot believe that I've seen with my own eyes
[3862.22 - 3869.74] P:1832.66 E:0.079632 |  a woman go sub 48 seconds, jumping her from seventh on the all-time list to second. It was astounding.
[3869.74 - 3875.74] P:1677.42 E:0.096091 |  Not only has she changed the world of 400 hurdles for the better, that event moved it on, but now
[3875.74 - 3881.02] P:1800.44 E:0.089530 |  she's doing it with a flat four. Absolutely obliterated the world and Olympic champion in Paulino,
[3881.02 - 3885.58] P:1711.92 E:0.087880 |  the former world champion in NASA, but I think more impressively it was the clock. It was the time
[3885.58 - 3890.78] P:1875.49 E:0.093177 |  that she did, and quite understandably, she's only just starting to go through the mix zone now.
[3890.78 - 3894.78] P:1778.58 E:0.091027 |  She's going to be a long night for her. She's just off to our right, draped in the stars and
[3894.78 - 3899.98] P:1567.84 E:0.086784 |  stripes, and yeah, everyone is going to want a piece of that woman tonight. Yeah, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrona,
[3899.98 - 3905.66] P:1781.80 E:0.093718 |  now the second fastest ever, as was Maraligh de Paulino, with her national record in silver,
[3905.66 - 3912.06] P:1544.32 E:0.086202 |  running 47.98 going third all time. It was phenomenal. Let's drop down in distance though,
[3912.06 - 3916.86] P:1692.39 E:0.094310 |  Alison, the 200-metre semi-finals. Let's start with the British women, Amy Hunt,
[3916.86 - 3922.14] P:1740.50 E:0.098934 |  Deena Asher Smith. We're talking about going second all time in terms of Sydney McLaughlin-Levrona.
[3922.14 - 3929.74] P:1796.45 E:0.090392 |  Amy Hunt, second on the all-time British list, with her 22.08 clocking. And to be second Brit
[3929.74 - 3935.90] P:1625.61 E:0.086567 |  on the all-time list, you're surping the great Cathy Cook. I mean, running quicker than the Queen
[3935.90 - 3942.14] P:1740.31 E:0.089536 |  of Sprinting. Back in the 80s, this woman was able to do 100, 200, 400. And I think we've got our
[3942.14 - 3948.38] P:1807.84 E:0.086329 |  own now in Amy Hunt. The frustration of the 100, not making the 100 final clearly showed,
[3948.38 - 3953.42] P:1595.26 E:0.086285 |  but it was a very, very composed run. She had the Olympic bronze medalist in Brittany Brown on one
[3953.42 - 3958.14] P:1765.52 E:0.092002 |  side. She had the world champion from Jamaica, Sharika Jackson on the other side. She held her
[3958.14 - 3964.94] P:1745.27 E:0.087037 |  own. She held her head and ran a perfect race for a 22-0. And I tell you what, looking now at the
[3965.02 - 3970.30] P:1690.69 E:0.083350 |  qualifiers, both her and Deena Asher Smith, who qualified in the second semifinal, will be starting
[3970.30 - 3974.22] P:1388.75 E:0.084893 |  to have a bit of a sniff of a medal, because I think there's one there. Well, let's talk about a
[3974.22 - 3979.74] P:1581.08 E:0.096031 |  sniff of a medal and somebody else like Amy Hunt, who had fire in their belly, not making the 100
[3979.74 - 3986.38] P:1652.46 E:0.090667 |  metre final, Zanelle Hughes in the men's 200 metre semifinals, a sub-22 clocking, looking a lot more
[3986.38 - 3992.22] P:1667.26 E:0.086856 |  comfortable, looking a lot happier, a lot more comfortable. He had the inside lane compared
[3992.22 - 3998.62] P:1698.78 E:0.091587 |  to Noah Lyles. Noah Lyles ran an unbelievable bend. Zanelle held back. He really did have to hold
[3998.62 - 4002.86] P:1736.20 E:0.079817 |  that bend hard, but he left his running for the home straight, and that's where it mattered,
[4002.86 - 4007.98] P:1755.34 E:0.089021 |  qualified by right in second. Let's go to two laps of the track. The rain was coming down
[4008.54 - 4014.38] P:1804.79 E:0.087866 |  for the men's 800 metres semifinals. Welcome back to the Etihad, Manchester City nil,
[4015.02 - 4021.18] P:1819.77 E:0.083774 |  Napoli nil. The team's just making their way back out onto the pitch. The 10 men of Napoli,
[4021.18 - 4030.46] P:1905.51 E:0.063247 |  they lost their captain Giovanni Dillorenzo, a red car, as he took out Erling Halland as he was
[4030.46 - 4035.34] P:1962.47 E:0.089205 |  driving towards goal, denying a goal-scoring opportunity, and he saw red. That was in the
[4035.34 - 4041.66] P:1913.42 E:0.075338 |  20th minute, so Michael Brown, Napoli, they've navigated 25 minutes down to 10. It is going to be
[4041.66 - 4047.98] P:1934.34 E:0.065850 |  a big ask with the pressure that Manchester City had in that first half for them to see out another 45.
[4048.06 - 4053.50] P:1886.77 E:0.073814 |  That'll be some result if they manage to do it, but can they get forward as well? Can they create
[4053.50 - 4058.78] P:1922.14 E:0.076974 |  opportunities at the right time? That'll be something this manager will be asking, not just to stay in it,
[4059.58 - 4064.70] P:1898.41 E:0.080221 |  to try and contribute, to try and take the ball, to try and take the chances. He knows when to do it.
[4064.70 - 4068.54] P:1779.44 E:0.086609 |  He'll have already prepped for these scenarios. They'll be very organised as we know with the manager,
[4069.42 - 4073.26] P:1898.72 E:0.070512 |  but City also are going to have done their prep and they'll know where the weakens are.
[4073.98 - 4080.78] P:2001.57 E:0.083869 |  So we are back under the lights here at the Etihad, a very warm and balmy evening in Manchester.
[4081.50 - 4088.78] P:1925.24 E:0.055336 |  Tonight, a lot of short sleeves around the stadium, even myself, which is very rare for me,
[4088.78 - 4095.10] P:1868.04 E:0.056121 |  but it is a warm evening. I'm setting a coat, almost for going soft. I was putting it on,
[4095.10 - 4098.94] P:1828.80 E:0.067796 |  I just haven't had time to really think about taking it off. I might have to do that in a second,
[4098.94 - 4104.54] P:1941.69 E:0.069713 |  but hopefully this game is going to hoten up, get some more chances. Can we get a breakthrough from
[4104.54 - 4112.54] P:1918.95 E:0.060994 |  either side? Certainly if Napoli can find an answer, that will open things up and City will come strong,
[4112.54 - 4118.54] P:1882.05 E:0.059971 |  but City will be patient, they'll wait. Some people will say, can they go a little bit earlier,
[4118.54 - 4124.38] P:1833.97 E:0.062483 |  a little bit quicker? That would be the message for me, but Pep knows over time he will grind the
[4124.70 - 4129.58] P:1879.62 E:0.076401 |  sides down. Napoli have come out and they are already pressing higher than they did in the end
[4129.58 - 4134.06] P:1889.03 E:0.088540 |  of that first half. Hoylan trying to put pressure on and Gwissa joining him and LeBocca even getting
[4134.06 - 4141.42] P:1941.58 E:0.069071 |  forward. Donorima on the ball, but Napoli certainly playing higher up the pitch as Michael Brown takes
[4141.42 - 4145.90] P:1900.95 E:0.075808 |  his jacket off. You've even got long sleeves underneath the jacket. You've got in my head now,
[4145.90 - 4149.82] P:1735.22 E:0.084439 |  I'm just a player in a football match, no one could ever get inside my head, but you have done,
[4149.82 - 4153.50] P:1781.27 E:0.055205 |  you said, right, you're too warm, you've got to take it off. I think I must be making you hot with it on.
[4155.34 - 4158.78] P:1769.08 E:0.090168 |  I'm just used to a lot colder climates, I think north of the border.
[4158.78 - 4162.38] P:2015.72 E:0.075117 |  Enemy Manchester City coming forward. Your mind is 10 now, I think.
[4163.98 - 4168.38] P:1900.35 E:0.088842 |  Rodri on the ball, he's got Gavarriol to his left-hand side and now Manchester City coming
[4168.38 - 4173.50] P:2006.17 E:0.081588 |  forward with Dock, who left edge of the penalty area, driving towards Palletano, shuffling right,
[4173.50 - 4178.46] P:1940.69 E:0.086299 |  step over, gets the ball away, lovely ball in towards Reinders, but well cleared by Bungiorno
[4178.46 - 4184.86] P:1970.71 E:0.071226 |  only as far as Rodri, so now City come forward down the right-hand side with Bernardo Silva.
[4185.66 - 4192.78] P:1852.03 E:0.059932 |  Got support from Diaz, Gavarriol. Midway between the halfway line and the edge of the Napoli area.
[4193.66 - 4202.78] P:1756.25 E:0.049588 |  Diaz, Rodri, Manchester City again trying to draw this Napoli backline out. Dock, to the edge of
[4203.26 - 4207.18] P:1831.78 E:0.055937 |  the byline, tries to cut it back, but it is cut out.
[4209.42 - 4214.22] P:1814.44 E:0.072208 |  And now Manchester City pick up a loose ball, so let me run you through the teams. Manchester City
[4214.22 - 4220.70] P:1879.47 E:0.075513 |  as they were at the start against Man United, same starting 11, ball clipped in towards Foden,
[4220.70 - 4226.62] P:1961.65 E:0.062544 |  it's cleared by Bungiorno and now over the head of La Boca, but again it's fallen to City feet.
[4226.62 - 4234.62] P:2040.58 E:0.045767 |  So Donnaruma in goal, the shot from Nico Reilly blocked, falls to the feet of Dock,
[4234.62 - 4237.58] P:1923.88 E:0.073299 |  Dock driving towards the left edge of the penalty area, on to his right foot,
[4237.58 - 4241.74] P:2010.49 E:0.095425 |  touch inside to Reinders, shot away, he was crossing it for Halland, but it was cleared
[4242.70 - 4251.02] P:1960.85 E:0.069972 |  by Bekema, who is down holding his head, is out for a Manchester City corner,
[4251.02 - 4256.78] P:1968.95 E:0.063633 |  that was a dangerous ball across from Reinders. You call it the first one, do you know you
[4256.78 - 4261.02] P:1945.94 E:0.084874 |  blocked the first shot, you felt his knee possibly, he's got across blocked another,
[4261.58 - 4267.74] P:1977.16 E:0.075325 |  but he's got a little bit of discomfort, he's up now, good position, Dock you're doing well, Reinders,
[4267.74 - 4273.18] P:1996.52 E:0.075381 |  he arrives quickly, snapshot, tries to go far post and now City with another corner.
[4274.46 - 4277.50] P:1966.56 E:0.089954 |  Right hand to Phil Foden, Reis and it goes towards the area,
[4278.30 - 4281.98] P:1836.37 E:0.058302 |  headed clear, so let me try and run you through this City team, no let's not because here comes
[4281.98 - 4287.42] P:1976.84 E:0.061702 |  Bernardo Silva, he's got Dock who now on the right hand side, which is where one of his assists came
[4287.42 - 4295.58] P:1954.04 E:0.052767 |  from against Manchester United on that right foot, Reilly gets it back from Diaz, edge of the area,
[4295.58 - 4302.30] P:1855.44 E:0.065649 |  Silva spins, Foden left edge of the penalty area, back inside to Reinders, Reinders drops it back
[4302.30 - 4309.34] P:1933.42 E:0.058459 |  to Rodri, Rodri trying to find Dock who the sliding challenge comes in from Oliveira,
[4309.90 - 4316.70] P:1938.01 E:0.065174 |  but it falls to City feet, so City, Don Roman Gol, a back four of O'Reilly, Vardial, Diaz and Kasanov,
[4317.66 - 4326.78] P:1909.64 E:0.055032 |  Rodri Reinders in that midfield dual, Dock who Foden, Silva supporting Erling Halland up front
[4326.86 - 4331.26] P:1920.83 E:0.062405 |  and it is Reinders out to Dock who switched on to that right hand side,
[4332.54 - 4338.86] P:1815.59 E:0.069586 |  Rodri Reinders trying to flick it round the corner and spin but Buadurno is there to clear
[4338.86 - 4345.66] P:1884.61 E:0.058432 |  and it will go out for Manchester City throwing, so to the visitors, Malinkovic Savic who's had
[4345.66 - 4353.90] P:1855.36 E:0.060563 |  a fabulous game in goal, their back four now is Oliveira at left back, Buadurno, Buquema
[4354.54 - 4359.42] P:1967.07 E:0.087332 |  and Polatano who's dropped back as the ball goes across the face of goal from Foden, there's
[4359.42 - 4365.90] P:1974.12 E:0.078273 |  nobody at the back post to touch it in, he puts his hands over his face, that was an opportunity,
[4365.90 - 4370.30] P:1912.24 E:0.090014 |  I think he was looking for that far post Michael but there wasn't anybody there just to knock it in
[4370.30 - 4375.98] P:1935.07 E:0.079943 |  when it dragged wide, he's pulled it too far actually, great position, Dock who causing problems,
[4375.98 - 4382.22] P:2049.14 E:0.070533 |  he's got a good awareness, that square passes the pre-pull approach, those midfield runs,
[4382.22 - 4389.50] P:2022.49 E:0.066679 |  the heart of the track for any midfield player and strikes it left-footed just across the face,
[4390.06 - 4394.62] P:1928.09 E:0.078934 |  another chance gone away for City, they've got to find an answer, they've got to convert.
[4397.18 - 4403.02] P:1868.85 E:0.061026 |  As Napoli come forward, ball down the left, Hoyland, he's got two Manchester City players around him,
[4403.02 - 4406.86] P:1940.86 E:0.094119 |  he goes down under the pressure and Gwis has got his hands raised asking for the free kick,
[4406.86 - 4411.26] P:1944.10 E:0.088707 |  he's not going to get it so I will continue with that Napoli team, Malinkovic Savic in goal,
[4411.26 - 4416.62] P:2012.21 E:0.081303 |  it's a back four of Oliveira on the left, Bondurno-Bochema and it's Spinazzola at right back,
[4416.62 - 4423.50] P:1927.06 E:0.072707 |  Poletano in front of him and Guisa, Lobocca, McTominay and Rasmus Hoyland leading the line,
[4424.54 - 4431.90] P:1950.31 E:0.058139 |  down to 10 men with the red card shown to Dilarenzo early in the first half
[4433.42 - 4439.02] P:1911.05 E:0.071430 |  and Napoli coming forward through Anguisa, Pipp Guardiola not happy that the visitors are
[4439.10 - 4445.74] P:1883.63 E:0.062939 |  getting a little bit of joy further up the pitch. They've got to have a little bit of territory,
[4445.74 - 4450.14] P:1901.95 E:0.076987 |  this is literally a couple of passes, this is what happens when you don't score,
[4451.18 - 4457.10] P:1878.48 E:0.068913 |  Guardiola is waving his hands around, he's not looking happy at all,
[4458.06 - 4463.10] P:1823.73 E:0.074763 |  very frustrated figure at the moment as the ball into the area and Guisa turns,
[4463.10 - 4468.22] P:2002.76 E:0.090225 |  left edge, he pulls it back beautifully to the penalty spot, nobody there was just ahead of
[4468.22 - 4473.74] P:1950.82 E:0.086821 |  Spinazzola and D'Occu's able to clear and now he ghosts past Poletano who pulls him back,
[4473.74 - 4480.70] P:1894.34 E:0.063449 |  that would be a yellow card for the man now wearing the armband for Napoli,
[4481.42 - 4486.30] P:1920.46 E:0.077751 |  cynical foul as D'Occu tried to race clear. Well how do you stop him because he just dropped his
[4486.30 - 4492.62] P:1939.69 E:0.064655 |  shoulder, stepped inside, he literally left Poletano hasn't he pulled him back, thinking what
[4492.62 - 4496.78] P:1814.32 E:0.091164 |  else could I do, let him drive through the middle, he decides to take a foul but now you've not got
[4496.78 - 4504.70] P:1920.80 E:0.051515 |  any more. Certainly does not and that would make the evening go from bad to worse for Napoli
[4504.70 - 4510.54] P:1826.07 E:0.071343 |  should they get another red card but at the moment they are very much still in this game,
[4510.54 - 4518.46] P:1856.77 E:0.053436 |  still goalless at the Etihad despite being down to 10 the visitors since the 20th minute
[4519.42 - 4526.38] P:1885.86 E:0.050647 |  but Manchester City the team asking all the questions but that is a loose pass which
[4527.26 - 4532.70] P:1816.98 E:0.064503 |  Poletano allows to just cut across him before he gathers and drops it back to Spinazzola,
[4532.70 - 4538.86] P:1992.95 E:0.072765 |  poor clearance though from Spinazzola straight to Cavadial who does well under pressure from
[4538.86 - 4544.46] P:1772.91 E:0.068728 |  Hoyland and again Rodri looking to come forward, lovely turn from Foden into the area with Reinders,
[4544.46 - 4550.94] P:1892.66 E:0.064784 |  onto his right foot, drops it to Nico Reilly who tries to find Foden, it's dropped and fallen
[4550.94 - 4557.66] P:2020.79 E:0.069183 |  though for D'Occu, left foot cross, deep looking for Silva, beautiful touch from Silva on the far
[4557.66 - 4567.34] P:1924.42 E:0.045316 |  side, drops it back to Cavadial looking to pull the trigger, it was sort of a kind of a probing
[4567.34 - 4574.06] P:1799.47 E:0.067592 |  pass through the Napoli defence but straight into the arms of Malinkovic Savic and this is the big
[4574.14 - 4580.54] P:1877.94 E:0.066259 |  question for Pep Guardiola and for his Manchester City team how do they find the Christmas or play
[4581.82 - 4586.70] P:1778.19 E:0.069142 |  the killer pass to create that opening? I think they'll find it, I think it's a matter of time,
[4586.70 - 4591.66] P:1840.08 E:0.073843 |  you see they're going to attire there's Napoli side as we know but when Napoli get the ball
[4591.66 - 4595.02] P:1907.45 E:0.062491 |  they've had a couple of chances they've got to create an extra pass better now,
[4595.02 - 4601.66] P:1888.19 E:0.066376 |  Lobotka he's brave enough to do it to keep it to stay on the ball, he's given it away too many times
[4602.22 - 4610.46] P:1946.21 E:0.060962 |  Spinazzola looking long for Hoylan, cleared though by Guardiola and Napoli are going to make
[4610.46 - 4615.98] P:1862.20 E:0.067930 |  another change and it is going to be Paul Itano who's just picked up that yellow card
[4617.82 - 4621.82] P:1931.65 E:0.084839 |  who goes off, he passes the captain arm band to the man coming on Juan Jesus,
[4623.34 - 4630.22] P:1840.39 E:0.047527 |  a centre back, so a centre back for a right winger, it looks like we're going to get Antonio
[4630.78 - 4631.66] P:1873.41 E:0.044424 |  Conte back three.
[4634.86 - 4638.70] P:1839.36 E:0.097539 |  Let's see how that goes you're not because he obviously realises that he's on a yellow card
[4638.70 - 4645.18] P:1940.70 E:0.067879 |  can't take any more risk he's going to get exposed so decided to have a little shuffle,
[4645.18 - 4649.10] P:1911.91 E:0.089195 |  see how that changes how it affects it is that really a good idea?
[4650.78 - 4657.82] P:1916.49 E:0.072777 |  It was the tried and the tested and the very successful formation of last season as Napoli went on
[4657.82 - 4665.58] P:1816.40 E:0.046805 |  to win the Scudetta, he's changed it up this season, Mormid Fielder's brought into the club
[4666.46 - 4672.30] P:1885.92 E:0.066467 |  he had to find a way to get them all in notably Kevin De Bruyne in particular
[4673.58 - 4681.18] P:1884.38 E:0.053970 |  so he went to the back four, Scott McTominay starting out on the left hand side but drifting in
[4681.26 - 4684.78] P:1817.73 E:0.076437 |  allowed Kevin De Bruyne to just sit in between him and Anguisa
[4686.86 - 4689.98] P:1811.48 E:0.086968 |  but De Bruyne sacrificed in the first half after the red card
[4692.30 - 4696.94] P:1876.07 E:0.053695 |  and now Conte has gone to the back three once again
[4698.46 - 4703.50] P:1815.49 E:0.072524 |  does that set his intentions out would he be happy to leave here with the way things are?
[4703.50 - 4705.02] P:1971.84 E:0.079411 |  He's already said there's the answer
[4705.98 - 4708.30] P:2031.40 E:0.106772 |  Into Holland, gets ahead on it, there's the only goal
[4709.50 - 4717.50] P:2031.88 E:0.096682 |  one little ball into Erling Holland the one chance he needed, a flicked header which looped over
[4717.50 - 4725.50] P:2010.23 E:0.089544 |  the length of its savage and Erling Holland is the fastest man to 50 goals in the Champions League
[4725.50 - 4731.90] P:1996.12 E:0.097312 |  he's done it in his 49th appearance and it is the goal that breaks the deadlock
[4731.98 - 4738.70] P:1981.75 E:0.084410 |  it is the goal that puts Manchester City ahead, who else but Harland, Manchester City won Napoli Nill
[4739.42 - 4745.58] P:1931.86 E:0.098105 |  this guy he just waits for opportunity, Conte makes a decision, it's a great little flick from Forden
[4746.22 - 4751.18] P:1892.33 E:0.107728 |  as Harland steps forward central of the box he knows where the goal is, he doesn't try and
[4751.18 - 4756.46] P:1919.36 E:0.094479 |  head it too hard, he doesn't head it in the ground it's a wonderful ball, he has a little look just
[4756.46 - 4763.66] P:1965.77 E:0.082529 |  dinks it over the goalkeeper, so calm, collective, there he goes off running, Conte makes the change
[4763.66 - 4768.22] P:1850.82 E:0.080260 |  I said it was dangerous, it didn't last long probably a minute and then they were punished
[4769.50 - 4775.82] P:1936.62 E:0.076666 |  Erling Holland doing what Erling Holland does best and it gets a celebration from his manager
[4776.62 - 4783.02] P:1930.24 E:0.075919 |  and if you want to put in context how quickly Erling Holland has got to 50 Champions League goals
[4783.02 - 4791.66] P:1945.22 E:0.072028 |  well the record he's beaten was Rube Van Nisteroy of 62 games so he has done it with 12 games to spare
[4793.26 - 4804.06] P:1906.08 E:0.067239 |  he really is an incredible goal scorer that is his 130th Manchester City goals in all competitions
[4804.86 - 4815.74] P:1875.58 E:0.074801 |  in his 151st appearance and it just took that beautiful little flicked ball through the middle
[4815.74 - 4822.46] P:1944.53 E:0.058172 |  of that Napoli defence and Harland was onto it like an absolute flash with the deftest of finishes
[4824.30 - 4828.86] P:1862.41 E:0.077830 |  that's a different finish isn't it for him we've seen many we talked about that that lunge to the back
[4828.86 - 4835.18] P:2021.09 E:0.070334 |  force, black post we've seen the acrobatic ones we've seen strikes taking 1v1s and that's a nice
[4835.18 - 4840.86] P:1870.80 E:0.074529 |  little soft leaping header he's got the lot hasn't he whenever he's in front of goal understands what's
[4840.86 - 4847.90] P:1945.00 E:0.070580 |  needed, City now it's going to move it go a little bit quicker but they know they need a second one
[4848.94 - 4853.82] P:1986.60 E:0.081759 |  and Dokku trying to provide it into the area onto his right foot drops it for Foden inside looking
[4853.82 - 4859.18] P:1978.22 E:0.078409 |  for Harland eventually gets onto it the second attempt Harland and now with Dokku Harland peeling
[4859.18 - 4867.90] P:1934.95 E:0.051110 |  in behind but he goes to Foden back to goal leaves it for Guardiola just about every outfield player
[4867.90 - 4873.90] P:1844.75 E:0.069153 |  on the pitch camped around the edge of Napoli's penalty area but it's Spinatsola who comes away
[4873.90 - 4881.10] P:1806.98 E:0.082154 |  with it he's got only Hoiland ahead of him and the pass cut out by Guardiola, Harland into the path
[4881.10 - 4888.30] P:1879.08 E:0.058588 |  almost of Reinders and Guisa though stops him getting on the end of it but again he goes long
[4888.30 - 4894.30] P:2000.97 E:0.073783 |  again it falls to City feet and now it's all the way back with Donoramata's, Nico Gonzalez is getting
[4894.30 - 4900.30] P:1950.26 E:0.071348 |  ready below us to come on for Manchester City getting plenty of instruction from Pep Guardiola
[4900.30 - 4905.42] P:2011.70 E:0.072800 |  yeah he's got a decision hasn't he will he protect Rodgery would that be one Arsenal around the corner
[4906.38 - 4913.26] P:1876.70 E:0.061062 |  yes he'll want to win it but that's the difficulty of a manager at this level he understands
[4915.02 - 4922.30] P:1936.40 E:0.063800 |  what's needed but Conti makes the change he got that one wrong because they conceded so quickly
[4922.30 - 4926.94] P:1933.91 E:0.075122 |  it's cruel at times when you do that and you have the belief but let's see what the change will be
[4927.98 - 4932.22] P:1964.58 E:0.094622 |  well Manchester City making it now and it is indeed Rodgery who does come off
[4933.18 - 4940.70] P:2086.92 E:0.090891 |  the man who scored the only goal in the Champions League final is Manchester City
[4942.30 - 4948.78] P:2052.15 E:0.096027 |  for crowned winners that 1-0 victory over Inter so his night is over he will rest up

[4995.58 - 5001.82] P:1902.09 E:0.065797 |  later on this evening and also on BBC One as Dooku knocks it back to the edge of the area but
[5002.46 - 5007.58] P:1936.23 E:0.084134 |  a foot prevents it getting to Nico O'Reilly but it's fallen to Gavario and Gwisa goes down
[5008.62 - 5014.06] P:1855.26 E:0.072140 |  clutching his face the referee stops it says it's a head injury must have got a little
[5014.78 - 5022.86] P:1901.52 E:0.053359 |  knock as he tussled for the ball there and Gwisa he looks to be okay gives Pep Guardiola a chance
[5022.86 - 5029.26] P:1854.79 E:0.060031 |  to have a quick word with some of his players he's calling a few over but he'll be just an elbow
[5029.26 - 5034.30] P:1962.01 E:0.087025 |  just it's an elbow from Nico just into his face but it's one of those it's not a swing of an elbow
[5034.30 - 5039.90] P:1907.88 E:0.075202 |  it's when he just gets close as he's making himself big to make an action he's unfortunate he gets caught
[5040.86 - 5047.10] P:1872.11 E:0.064260 |  no wonder he's feeling that one yeah well we are over the hour mark here at the Etihad and Manchester
[5047.10 - 5053.98] P:1851.80 E:0.056824 |  City have found the breakthrough from who else but their number nine Erling Halland with his 50th

[5072.14 - 5076.46] P:1889.09 E:0.087247 |  Hoyland there but manages to squeeze it through to Guardiola it's a frustrating night for Rasmus
[5076.46 - 5081.50] P:1968.55 E:0.070216 |  Hoyland he would have loved to have come back to Manchester and put on a show but it's really
[5081.50 - 5088.22] P:1972.59 E:0.041997 |  he's been an isolated figure up there he has it's so tough but can he
[5089.50 - 5095.74] P:1892.43 E:0.066037 |  can you find a solution oh an answer when you he's so starved of the ball he's got to wait
[5095.74 - 5100.30] P:2029.94 E:0.081518 |  be patient Harlan does that exceptionally well yes there's more flow coming his way
[5100.30 - 5105.34] P:2023.73 E:0.092614 |  City on the overload into Dooku lovely pass from Nico Reilly but that is really well defended from
[5105.34 - 5111.02] P:2070.03 E:0.096286 |  LeBocca Dooku driving towards goal inside the area and LeBocca got back quickly got a toe in it
[5111.02 - 5117.74] P:1998.26 E:0.059509 |  will be a Manchester City corner but it looked to almost open up there for Dooku he's so quick
[5117.74 - 5122.30] P:1925.87 E:0.079916 |  off that left-hand side very quick LeBocca the hold in midfield player he's there to see
[5122.30 - 5129.26] P:1946.34 E:0.066698 |  off danger that little presence but he gets across quite aggressively now City looking forward and
[5129.26 - 5134.70] P:2002.77 E:0.073631 |  looking to go direct in the central area with his set piece left-fitted and it goes to head
[5135.42 - 5145.26] P:1934.80 E:0.044371 |  off it Nico but wide it goes it looked like a well worked move that just Nico Gonzalez's header
[5145.26 - 5153.90] P:1946.33 E:0.051243 |  wide off the target but nobody traced his run it's square wasn't it it's a flat ball always tough
[5153.90 - 5160.94] P:1992.52 E:0.068750 |  to try and just glance it on he catches it quite square well wide Napoli decide to push everyone
[5160.94 - 5167.10] P:1976.42 E:0.071599 |  forward try and get up the pitch try and get some sort of momentum in a forward area as we haven't
[5167.10 - 5172.30] P:2005.06 E:0.075172 |  seen much of them we did say which way you were going to look left or right it's been that first
[5172.30 - 5179.98] P:1921.75 E:0.065034 |  half it has been mostly left in the second half but now Napoli move it forward into the run of
[5179.98 - 5185.90] P:2017.45 E:0.076207 |  Spinat Solais got Nico Riley for company but he manages to flick it towards the penalty area but
[5185.90 - 5193.02] P:1938.40 E:0.052823 |  it's straight into the arms of Donoruma and there's been a few that have been quite quiet tonight
[5193.02 - 5199.58] P:1914.94 E:0.049921 |  for Napoli and one in particular Scott McTominay we haven't seen much of him such a good season
[5199.98 - 5204.54] P:1945.32 E:0.058718 |  he's covering so much ground he's on that left hand side he's a filling slot he probably will
[5204.54 - 5211.74] P:2021.84 E:0.063020 |  arguably be better in a more central role in this sort of setup but you can't always do that you
[5211.74 - 5217.50] P:1957.80 E:0.060008 |  haven't always got the players you've got to feel like what's the best outcome how can you argue with
[5217.50 - 5223.66] P:2018.53 E:0.073390 |  this manager down to our right hand side still pushing still demanding more as Pep just finds
[5223.74 - 5228.62] P:2057.30 E:0.062780 |  different answers can we see a twist can City get this second goal then
[5229.90 - 5235.50] P:1975.63 E:0.043852 |  you've got to do it quicker for me one thing you cannot say about Antonio Conte is that he's
[5235.50 - 5243.98] P:1914.62 E:0.051378 |  not passionate he is all passionate from the sidelines the Champions League winner as a player
[5244.30 - 5250.46] P:1857.81 E:0.036333 |  at Juventus beating Ajax in the final
[5254.22 - 5259.26] P:1982.84 E:0.107869 |  as Dooku comes forward and he's found the finish this time the ball through the middle Dooku
[5259.26 - 5265.10] P:2035.64 E:0.103067 |  onto his left foot he just managed to find the angle to squeeze it in right across the face of
[5265.10 - 5271.82] P:2046.38 E:0.095056 |  goal into that far corner and again in the blink of an eye City find the little bit of space a
[5271.82 - 5278.14] P:2015.55 E:0.094575 |  little way to get in behind this time is Jeremy Dooku who finds the finish and pet guardia
[5278.14 - 5285.02] P:2000.53 E:0.079956 |  all applause as the Manchester City players all engulfed the little Belgian winger Manchester
[5285.02 - 5293.66] P:1986.54 E:0.085809 |  City to Napoli nil magical from Dooku he sees spaces and then he just commits with pace that's
[5293.66 - 5298.94] P:1851.99 E:0.087248 |  what can hurt you and it looked like he was going to be going the other way away from goal he turns
[5298.94 - 5304.62] P:1899.93 E:0.083807 |  quickly and then that's where his feet comes drives into the space slots it under the oncoming
[5304.62 - 5311.34] P:1987.65 E:0.082970 |  Malenkovich Savage into the far corner goalkeeper couldn't get there because he's so quick just
[5311.34 - 5317.66] P:2019.29 E:0.088601 |  a little cheeky nutmeg the goalkeeper slams the floor defensively can't get near him because he
[5317.66 - 5323.58] P:1885.94 E:0.090540 |  takes everybody out with that pace and direction that's the difference when you do things like
[5323.58 - 5331.58] P:1890.73 E:0.071816 |  that talked about pace it talked about needing to be quicker what about that he just wriggled through
[5331.58 - 5338.54] P:1954.45 E:0.082811 |  a little tiny gap between two Napoli defenders and even one of his own players in there he just
[5338.54 - 5344.78] P:1946.67 E:0.077664 |  bundled his way through and then when it was him one-on-one with the goalkeeper the angle was tight
[5345.74 - 5350.94] P:1943.46 E:0.081232 |  but he found the finish between the legs of Malenkovich Savage and since Napoli have gone
[5350.94 - 5356.14] P:1998.83 E:0.063497 |  to this back three they've conceded twice and you have to say Michael it's got to be game over now
[5357.26 - 5363.58] P:1897.15 E:0.077758 |  yeah you certainly think so but I always find it hard to say that with a Manchester City side
[5363.58 - 5369.82] P:1932.15 E:0.071887 |  who made things very difficult at times here he goes Jeremy Dooku pushing back now he just checks
[5369.82 - 5378.62] P:1908.52 E:0.048084 |  and waits it allows a bit more patience ball in looking for Harlan doesn't get a little flick
[5378.62 - 5385.42] P:1907.68 E:0.068789 |  out to Dooku and Spinachsola is able to launch it clear and Anguisa will get on the end of it
[5386.06 - 5391.74] P:1941.76 E:0.076437 |  Gvardiol tried to clear it missed it completely now Anguisa driving towards the Manchester City
[5391.74 - 5397.42] P:1924.86 E:0.075900 |  area checks back LeBocca now back to Anguisa on this right hand side but his pass is really
[5397.42 - 5405.66] P:2026.65 E:0.053496 |  poor and Dooku just picks that up and says thank you very much Niz looks a tired figure Anguisa
[5405.66 - 5411.58] P:1922.53 E:0.082315 |  Pep's going crazy Yosco Vardio try to flick it inside missed it Anguisa just makes great runs
[5412.54 - 5417.74] P:1983.21 E:0.069963 |  but Pep's jumping out the technical area about the recovery runs of Manchester City
[5417.74 - 5423.74] P:1921.49 E:0.064401 |  then they could go quick Dooku gets it he just says wait let's set it up be patient
[5423.74 - 5427.50] P:1813.26 E:0.085293 |  let's not get counted let's not do anything daft because that was a little moment there
[5428.78 - 5435.42] P:2056.00 E:0.064920 |  City got square on this is an interesting substitution for Pep Guardiola he's just next to him now
[5435.42 - 5442.70] P:1944.85 E:0.055778 |  yep the Brazilian Savino is stripped and ready to come on just putting a little bit of tape around
[5442.70 - 5449.26] P:1919.17 E:0.064925 |  the bottom of his socks as Nico O'Reilly drives towards the penalty area inside to Foden Foden back
[5449.26 - 5455.26] P:2041.09 E:0.078252 |  to O'Reilly all just got the ball tangled under his feet a little bit as sort of looks to the sky
[5455.26 - 5461.10] P:1910.57 E:0.076919 |  that was nearly an opening for the young fullback that was a bit showboating from now a little bit
[5461.10 - 5467.34] P:1906.76 E:0.089187 |  more of a senior player from the Academy Phil Foden to another new recruit Nico O'Reilly driving
[5467.34 - 5473.26] P:1971.28 E:0.088498 |  from left back into positions little one two he's very clever that reverse pass almost gets in but
[5473.26 - 5479.66] P:1994.81 E:0.091488 |  just under his feet and what's the change going to be for the Pep Dooku done so well
[5480.70 - 5486.14] P:2011.09 E:0.098041 |  yep Dooku who's making weight so that goal from Jeremy Dooku to make it 2-0
[5486.94 - 5493.26] P:2015.62 E:0.095502 |  his last real piece of action and he gets a huge arm round the shoulder from his manager as he walks
[5493.26 - 5500.94] P:1977.81 E:0.075865 |  off and Savino takes his place on the left hand side 2-0 to Manchester City here it is now 2-0
[5500.94 - 5507.26] P:1923.29 E:0.061927 |  to Barcelona at St James's Park do you want to guess who scored Michael go on then Marcus Rashford
[5507.26 - 5513.18] P:1974.52 E:0.073456 |  it's second of the evening write him off when you you dare do it he just keeps coming back doesn't he
[5513.74 - 5519.98] P:1868.81 E:0.067369 |  this could be a really good move for him wonderful player let's see we hope he gets back to his best
[5520.86 - 5527.10] P:1916.84 E:0.057420 |  England could do with that but he's certainly having a nice return to English shores this evening
[5527.66 - 5534.22] P:1980.98 E:0.068291 |  at St James's Park as Savino gets his first chance to run and look inside for Foden gets it a second
[5534.22 - 5539.98] P:1973.87 E:0.080044 |  10 back to Savino lovely touch from Foden but he's pushed wind Savino across comes in from Silva
[5539.98 - 5546.06] P:1982.65 E:0.078179 |  and it is to play tonight for a corner that was lovely from Phil Foden yeah Phil Foden delighted
[5546.06 - 5553.90] P:1949.82 E:0.062013 |  his back playing getting minutes it's just an infectious player who had a difficult season
[5554.62 - 5560.46] P:2001.51 E:0.077411 |  now finding his way into the team that Manchester Derby goal setting that confidence back that
[5560.46 - 5567.18] P:2006.40 E:0.070410 |  Phil Foden we know he's contributing a big way tonight also little city putting pressure on
[5567.18 - 5573.66] P:1956.81 E:0.060891 |  corner is short to the edge of the area back to Foden in with the in-swinger but Malinkovic
[5573.66 - 5585.26] P:1899.93 E:0.042255 |  Savic able to claim it as we take into the final 20 minutes off this Champions League
[5586.06 - 5593.02] P:1914.97 E:0.059770 |  opener for these two teams Manchester City leading by two goals to nil that is also the
[5593.02 - 5598.62] P:1956.00 E:0.063599 |  score line at St James's Park but not for the home side it is Barcelona who lead there as
[5599.42 - 5610.38] P:1902.15 E:0.055363 |  Napoli prepared to make a trio of substitutions so Anguisa will make way for Elmas
[5613.50 - 5617.18] P:1904.54 E:0.034087 |  in the first off those changes also
[5618.06 - 5627.66] P:1810.79 E:0.056782 |  Rasmus Hoyland will make way David Nere's coming on for him there's the booze for the former well
[5628.54 - 5634.06] P:1950.76 E:0.068137 |  technically current Manchester United man on loan but with an option to buy at the end of the season
[5634.06 - 5642.30] P:1933.92 E:0.048996 |  for Napoli and also Billy Gilmore makes his way onto the field he replaces La Butka
[5643.02 - 5645.34] P:1974.35 E:0.048047 |  so a trio of changes
[5648.62 - 5649.98] P:1805.60 E:0.063755 |  for the visitors
[5654.46 - 5658.30] P:1884.04 E:0.050363 |  as they try to make something happen and first touch
[5660.62 - 5665.58] P:1855.68 E:0.071940 |  for Nerez finds Gilmore but it's ended up back at Malinkovic Savic

[5695.26 - 5700.30] P:1887.26 E:0.087240 |  player Billy Gilmore knowing him right throughout his junior career met him early on
[5701.58 - 5707.82] P:1781.12 E:0.074399 |  really tired he nice player obviously La Butka and Anguisa and De Bruyne are now keeping him
[5707.82 - 5713.18] P:1757.06 E:0.071124 |  out of the team he's a great backup for contact it's a shame he can't get a few more minutes
[5715.34 - 5722.22] P:1796.72 E:0.062852 |  yeah he has been a fabulous player 24 years old now Billy Gilmore but a mainstay of
[5722.70 - 5727.58] P:1915.95 E:0.080873 |  the Scotland national team and already a Champions League winner with Chelsea

[5798.30 - 5804.22] P:1989.24 E:0.064443 |  i should really do that that's the next game we do i want to not see an update on it yeah
[5807.90 - 5809.74] P:1948.97 E:0.032579 |  but yeah real
[5811.82 - 5812.78] P:1932.15 E:0.085111 |  excitement when
[5815.90 - 5823.42] P:1849.90 E:0.063094 |  the two Scottish boys went over to Napoli such an iconic club in football from the days of
[5823.42 - 5829.98] P:1968.28 E:0.071532 |  Diego Maradona but a number of Scottish players making their way over to Serie A in recent years
[5830.30 - 5837.42] P:1850.99 E:0.045346 |  two of them on the field of play here this evening now as Manchester City
[5838.78 - 5844.46] P:1808.43 E:0.060187 |  come forward again as we head towards the 75 minute mark Manchester City
[5846.78 - 5853.26] P:1850.82 E:0.072733 |  we'll be happy to see this game out now Michael but you always know that treacherous 2-0 score line
[5853.26 - 5859.26] P:1901.68 E:0.055683 |  should they have a little glimpse and come concentration and allow Napoli back in it
[5859.26 - 5862.38] P:1922.14 E:0.090483 |  could get a little bit nervy but at the moment you're just doing that chastity at the end you're
[5862.38 - 5867.42] P:1944.30 E:0.071945 |  doing that chase at the end no you want to just make sure you've got full control that's the
[5867.42 - 5873.26] P:1905.49 E:0.058116 |  message from Pep and it just ease yourself in towards the end of the game because you keep
[5873.26 - 5879.50] P:1829.75 E:0.061714 |  saying it that huge game at the weekend you can't be complacent and look too much into that but
[5880.38 - 5886.62] P:1902.37 E:0.049469 |  you've ever got a better way of just moving the ball it's flat just waiting
[5887.58 - 5891.10] P:1835.49 E:0.090883 |  Napoli also as well thinking right will also must take this we don't want to get
[5891.98 - 5895.58] P:1982.19 E:0.083568 |  a real batter in we've done so well at the start of this season
[5897.42 - 5901.82] P:1868.74 E:0.083790 |  it has been an excellent start to the season for Napoli in the defense of their
[5901.82 - 5911.42] P:1764.77 E:0.051184 |  Serie A title three wins from three albeit they needed a 90th minute goal to get past Calary
[5911.58 - 5920.38] P:1756.96 E:0.033060 |  but they found a way and they sit top once again off Serie A level on points with Juventus
[5920.38 - 5927.42] P:1759.92 E:0.053610 |  who also have three wins from three but it's going to be a different season to last season
[5927.42 - 5931.98] P:1771.13 E:0.080061 |  for Antonio Conte having to battle on a European front as well as a domestic front
[5934.06 - 5941.10] P:1754.16 E:0.050756 |  something that certainly aided him last season as he led Napoli to the title in his first
[5941.10 - 5946.22] P:1910.00 E:0.071895 |  season in charge. A commentator on that game against Calary he just felt they just kept pushing
[5946.22 - 5950.94] P:1843.60 E:0.080013 |  and pushing and Guise had just made it into the penalty area at the end of the celebration they
[5950.94 - 5955.26] P:1791.58 E:0.080090 |  felt the togetherness in the side we think we showed that in the first half of the defensive
[5955.26 - 5960.46] P:1905.01 E:0.068526 |  setup yes they didn't get out they didn't create much against the city side it was so tough when
[5960.46 - 5965.98] P:1853.06 E:0.064754 |  they're in the stride to do that but no they got to take something from it it was a decision that
[5965.98 - 5972.46] P:1920.46 E:0.058821 |  their captain made the Lorenzo which he was so close but he got caught out mistakes happen
[5973.34 - 5979.26] P:2030.74 E:0.045665 |  and that's what's given them no chance this evening. And now Bernardo Silva looks to try
[5979.26 - 5986.54] P:1963.58 E:0.064557 |  and make it worse for Napoli the ball in drops to Savino edge of the area onto his left foot cuts
[5986.54 - 5991.74] P:2040.19 E:0.068421 |  it across but it's cleared before it can reach the foot of Nico Reilly only as far though as Nico
[5991.74 - 5999.50] P:1940.04 E:0.050909 |  Gonzales drops it back for Diaz and now Savino gets another chance from this left-hand side again
[5999.50 - 6003.66] P:2003.66 E:0.092951 |  he tries to skip past Spinazzola he goes down under pressure the referee's having a look
[6004.22 - 6010.06] P:1948.30 E:0.063927 |  but he's pointed for the goal kick that was right on the edge of the penalty area Savino gave the
[6010.06 - 6015.58] P:1933.57 E:0.072673 |  referee a long look he's still giving him a long look we'll get another chance to have a see of it
[6015.58 - 6022.06] P:1928.29 E:0.052675 |  but Spinazzola challenging with Savino anything for you? Yeah there wasn't much in it I think the
[6022.06 - 6029.74] P:1896.84 E:0.068212 |  legs went below Savino defensively very very strong that it's difficult when a wide player pushes you
[6029.74 - 6036.46] P:1855.45 E:0.067554 |  right into that space but yeah referee had a look decided against it Citysville probing asking
[6037.26 - 6044.06] P:1948.03 E:0.050722 |  different questions from different angles here's the changes from Pep as we expected
[6044.06 - 6049.74] P:1999.09 E:0.052013 |  we'll be looking towards the weekend it's dangerous to do it we obviously feel it's
[6049.74 - 6053.74] P:1876.72 E:0.077806 |  confident I think the players he's got available on the bench he should have every faith that they
[6053.74 - 6061.10] P:1910.40 E:0.055590 |  can do the job yeah it's a trio of changes getting ready I thought it was just the two but it will be
[6061.10 - 6069.98] P:1848.81 E:0.042115 |  three with Rico Lewis also getting stripped down below us it's always great for the commentator
[6069.98 - 6073.34] P:1937.40 E:0.074596 |  when there's three substitutions at once you have to have a bit of a scamper around to
[6073.34 - 6079.42] P:1974.77 E:0.072401 |  oh stickers everywhere stickers everywhere yeah I'm watching but here's that Rico Lewis Nathan
[6079.42 - 6088.06] P:2013.43 E:0.048776 |  Ackie Oscar Bob I hope he achieves he had a bad injury last season and he's a wonderful talent
[6088.06 - 6093.42] P:2042.62 E:0.062553 |  he started the season and felt like he would have been in for some time he's now back on the bench
[6093.42 - 6102.38] P:1916.37 E:0.042206 |  he's he's very versatile yeah big opportunity for some of Manchester City's younger players the
[6102.38 - 6108.30] P:2026.72 E:0.069899 |  injury list is lengthier than I'm sure pet would like at the moment with my mousse Cherokee Kovacic
[6108.30 - 6113.66] P:1860.10 E:0.054319 |  eight noory all out Calvin Phillips not part of the Champions League squad
[6116.46 - 6120.78] P:2013.35 E:0.067314 |  so an opportunity for these young players to gain valuable minutes and it will be
[6121.58 - 6127.34] P:1993.92 E:0.066084 |  the uh Rinders coming off for Bob in the first of the three changes
[6129.82 - 6130.78] P:1995.45 E:0.103090 |  so Oscar Bob
[6133.42 - 6138.14] P:2018.27 E:0.086318 |  making his 37th appearance this evening for Manchester City
[6138.14 - 6148.62] P:1891.20 E:0.062961 |  Gavardio another coming off he will be replaced by Nathan Ackie and they are preserving their
[6148.62 - 6157.34] P:1908.05 E:0.064780 |  man up front Erlen Halland scorer of the opening goal here this evening he will make way he will
[6159.02 - 6166.46] P:1972.79 E:0.088643 |  refresh those legs because he will be required to go again that is for sure on Sunday in that huge game
[6168.94 - 6169.42] P:2010.89 E:0.110540 |  against
[6170.38 - 6180.54] P:1921.43 E:0.076960 |  I see Oscar Bob replaces Harland as a number nine I talked about being versatile a lot of people
[6180.54 - 6184.78] P:1705.17 E:0.094265 |  wouldn't have thought he'd go as a number nine subpoena left hand side Bernardo stays right
[6185.66 - 6191.82] P:1902.14 E:0.063682 |  Rico Lewis just drops into the middle of the pitch this support where Rinders was just heading
[6192.70 - 6195.66] P:1790.33 E:0.071931 |  okay obviously slotting in left-sided centre back
[6197.10 - 6205.90] P:1700.43 E:0.067467 |  for Yosco Vardio the experience now what he brings he's been a partnership many occasions hasn't it him and Ruben Diaz
[6210.30 - 6214.78] P:1882.39 E:0.079615 |  as Manchester City come forward stopped though by Scott McTominay who's now got
[6215.42 - 6223.18] P:1756.28 E:0.054739 |  Bob scrapping at his heels but he manages to knock it clear and now Gilmore with the ball
[6223.82 - 6233.98] P:1788.74 E:0.046497 |  out to that left hand side but cut out by Silva Ackie bright orange boots just gleaming in the floodlights
[6236.46 - 6239.50] P:1625.63 E:0.070636 |  at the Etihad clear warm night
[6240.46 - 6242.62] P:1808.16 E:0.035800 |  in Manchester
[6244.54 - 6251.66] P:1779.27 E:0.065544 |  we're into the final nine minutes Manchester City comfortable with our 2-0 lead against the 10 men of Napoli
[6255.42 - 6263.74] P:1778.11 E:0.051945 |  as they look for an opening the substitute's all coming on all wanting to impress it's a huge game
[6263.74 - 6270.62] P:1695.57 E:0.055225 |  at the weekend at the Emirates they will want to play a part in that Savino
[6272.14 - 6276.06] P:1895.22 E:0.055323 |  two to get past so he checks back drops it back to Diaz
[6280.38 - 6284.62] P:1854.13 E:0.077742 |  and Manchester City they have such a strong Champions League home record
[6285.42 - 6291.10] P:1982.46 E:0.089936 |  I'm beaten in the last 21 group stage matches here at home winning 18 of them
[6291.98 - 6294.30] P:1893.06 E:0.089056 |  they look certain to make that 22
[6297.50 - 6305.50] P:1759.98 E:0.059144 |  with the way things are sitting this evening at this stage just eight minutes plus at a time
[6307.90 - 6314.06] P:1618.48 E:0.042032 |  Savino inside to O'Reilly gets it back from Ackie
[6315.34 - 6320.38] P:1777.53 E:0.076943 |  City just moving the ball around Savino left hand side now tries to drive towards the penalty
[6320.46 - 6326.70] P:1884.89 E:0.070228 |  into the left edge goes towards the byline chops back no room for the cross now he looks for options
[6327.42 - 6331.10] P:1767.42 E:0.033698 |  get support from Ackie back to Savino
[6333.90 - 6341.50] P:1859.14 E:0.065972 |  plays a little one two with Oscar Bob and O'Reilly and now Bob is challenged fairly and strongly by
[6341.50 - 6347.02] P:1664.35 E:0.049836 |  Bukema Napoli win possession back but they are deep in their own half
[6347.98 - 6351.98] P:1953.66 E:0.049071 |  as Elmash tries to get clear he's dispossessed
[6355.98 - 6361.82] P:1773.65 E:0.058551 |  Picardiola still prowling around the edge of his technical area Savino cross blocked
[6361.82 - 6365.34] P:1913.53 E:0.062579 |  into the arms of Milinkovic Savic stops the corner
[6366.86 - 6373.58] P:1780.92 E:0.064770 |  Picardiola this is 17th Champions League campaign takes them level with Jose Mourinho
[6377.42 - 6383.26] P:1919.88 E:0.063292 |  he's got some record hasn't he just keeps ticking them off new challenges new chapters
[6384.54 - 6391.98] P:1854.91 E:0.053634 |  different ways of playing different personnel and this one as well new coaching staff come and
[6391.98 - 6396.62] P:1894.12 E:0.074358 |  test me out you know what he says that's the message not just the players I need to freshen
[6396.62 - 6403.42] P:1945.83 E:0.061433 |  things up it's been a good performance overall yes it's been made easy but with the 10 men but
[6403.98 - 6406.94] P:2059.55 E:0.078264 |  City earned it City put them under pressure to make that decision
[6408.38 - 6414.14] P:1928.62 E:0.053850 |  seem comfortable it's a nice start this last year the Champions League they felt like you could
[6414.14 - 6419.34] P:1935.83 E:0.077071 |  recover later on with the games in a different format important to get a win straight away
[6421.82 - 6428.70] P:1804.14 E:0.057824 |  it is and he spoke about that in the build-up to this game because last season they didn't win
[6428.70 - 6433.42] P:1972.15 E:0.080722 |  their opening game of Champions League they drew it also at home against the Italian champions
[6433.42 - 6443.02] P:1821.38 E:0.056052 |  Inter last season who went on to reach the final but Manchester City never really fully got going
[6443.02 - 6450.14] P:1739.16 E:0.064519 |  in the Champions League last season they lost five of last seven games which is as many as they'd
[6450.14 - 6457.10] P:1702.35 E:0.078524 |  lost in the previous 61 games in the competition combined had to go through the playoff stage where
[6457.10 - 6466.14] P:1847.64 E:0.054068 |  they met Real Madrid who'd also had a very average group stage run of games and it was the
[6467.18 - 6473.90] P:1792.24 E:0.050313 |  Spaniards who went through to the last 16 so Manchester City knocked out before the competition
[6473.90 - 6478.38] P:1774.52 E:0.078876 |  for them for somebody for a team of their caliber really got going I was doing a lot of the games
[6478.38 - 6482.70] P:1815.08 E:0.086219 |  you just felt okay there's two or three games at the end you'll just win those and qualify and
[6482.70 - 6489.02] P:1945.09 E:0.071678 |  that's what you felt in this situation but playing everybody wants is much harder the top teams don't
[6489.02 - 6492.62] P:1799.58 E:0.089517 |  get a look at them so much regarding right we know what happened last time we know how to go and
[6492.62 - 6499.26] P:1904.82 E:0.067725 |  punish them it's much more work for the analysts their preparation different people to come up against
[6499.26 - 6509.42] P:1863.05 E:0.045424 |  them it was interesting yeah certainly a format that a lot of people felt perhaps favoured the
[6510.38 - 6515.42] P:1887.01 E:0.070181 |  the clubs who maybe traditionally would have been finishing third or fourth in the smaller
[6515.42 - 6522.94] P:1866.24 E:0.052515 |  group stage multiple group stage format of the competition rather than those that were used to
[6524.46 - 6527.74] P:1907.94 E:0.076506 |  winning the first few games and ensuring the their progression was
[6529.90 - 6534.54] P:1991.92 E:0.080728 |  already secured before the last game or so off that group stage but it's all different now there's
[6534.54 - 6542.78] P:1878.38 E:0.052682 |  new format I enjoyed the new format last season I have to say I was enjoying it for a while then
[6544.78 - 6549.82] P:1856.42 E:0.065570 |  I thought I was looking forward to the later stages with a lot of Manchester City games but
[6550.54 - 6555.74] P:1826.38 E:0.069255 |  it's always good we want to mix we want new people coming to to cause problems all around
[6555.74 - 6564.14] P:1905.93 E:0.048833 |  Europe it's a wonderful competition Manchester City have started their new campaign off
[6564.70 - 6573.26] P:1898.61 E:0.055620 |  very very well clean sheet two goals so far as the ball just ricochets off Oscar Bob as he goes for it
[6573.26 - 6579.98] P:1768.57 E:0.056512 |  and there's an injury on the edge off the area I think it's Bondurno that's down the Napoli centre
[6579.98 - 6587.74] P:1915.70 E:0.056833 |  half as he just tried to challenge Bob for that ball it skimmed through to the grateful hands off
[6587.74 - 6592.54] P:2006.09 E:0.072809 |  Malinkovic Savage but he looks to be in a little bit of pain Bondurno he's getting helped his feet
[6592.54 - 6600.94] P:1765.44 E:0.054728 |  now by Foulden I think you look at the game now Manchester City saying job done we want to leave
[6600.94 - 6605.34] P:1747.87 E:0.079033 |  it I feel like the Napoli players are going well we've got 10 men we've give absolutely everything
[6605.34 - 6609.98] P:1821.50 E:0.065950 |  we know we're not going to win look at what's the weekend you know it's like
[6611.34 - 6616.54] P:1965.60 E:0.074427 |  it's just later stages of games that you know you can't control you know you can't change you can't
[6616.54 - 6621.10] P:1945.90 E:0.073393 |  do anything about it it's kind of a little bit flat a little bit dead as we've just got a little
[6621.18 - 6626.22] P:2027.00 E:0.076381 |  glance on the camera there of Kevin de Bruyne as those fans just give him a little bit of a
[6626.22 - 6632.06] P:1951.08 E:0.066418 |  sing song as they start to leave the stadium you might not get to see him here again
[6634.14 - 6641.26] P:1753.32 E:0.065636 |  yes and his return to the Etihad was cut short the player sacrificed by Antonio Conte after the
[6641.26 - 6649.10] P:1923.44 E:0.060443 |  red card to Dillarezzo he had to put on another defender Conte and it was Kevin de Bruyne on his
[6649.10 - 6655.82] P:1965.04 E:0.069206 |  return who was the man who who made way for that substitution but Neres picks up a loose ball
[6655.82 - 6660.22] P:1937.70 E:0.084906 |  now he's all in his own but he's driving forward he's now got support on the left hand side from
[6660.22 - 6669.50] P:1826.58 E:0.047940 |  Oliveira Napoli players trying to get forward to give some support Oliveira does well and now
[6670.30 - 6675.74] P:1860.58 E:0.067673 |  mcdomany to Gilmore Napoli keeping possession they've dropped it back though it's back with
[6676.30 - 6681.98] P:1854.29 E:0.060577 |  Bon Giorno now onto the halfway line with Bacchema and Spinach-Sola
[6684.94 - 6690.14] P:1943.18 E:0.060014 |  Napoli just I think happy perhaps just to have a little bit of the ball for a change

[6791.42 - 6796.46] P:1721.84 E:0.076322 |  why is that because of the threat that wasn't really there but you already play what's in front

[6807.98 - 6811.74] P:1818.58 E:0.061844 |  really ended in the correct manner with the run of fixtures coming forward
[6812.30 - 6817.42] P:1968.28 E:0.048905 |  there's a tough run of fixtures starting with that trip to the Emirates on Sunday

[6833.98 - 6840.54] P:1891.93 E:0.067257 |  rest going into this game it certainly take it and it is especially at this stage of the
[6841.50 - 6845.34] P:1782.34 E:0.092252 |  season when some of these players haven't played too many minutes to go right three games
[6846.78 - 6854.46] P:1873.21 E:0.064279 |  in a week to balance it correctly the extra time but it's been a nice as I say 30 minutes for City
[6854.46 - 6860.70] P:1852.87 E:0.072560 |  where they've not actually been sort of put underneath pressure and turned around and
[6861.26 - 6867.66] P:1915.18 E:0.062870 |  it's been calm and collected from me there will be live commentary on radio five live and BBC
[6867.66 - 6873.10] P:1914.05 E:0.080032 |  sounds off that really tasty clash at the Emirates between Arsenal and Manchester City have passed
[6873.10 - 6878.94] P:1898.51 E:0.065359 |  four on Sunday that one kicks off it follows commentary of Sunderland against Aston Villa which
[6878.94 - 6884.38] P:1916.78 E:0.067458 |  is an interesting one given that the two teams starts to the season Sunderland been very strong at
[6884.38 - 6894.30] P:2000.46 E:0.069381 |  home and there is the full-time whistle it draws to an end this opening match for Manchester City
[6894.30 - 6900.06] P:1946.76 E:0.087515 |  and Napoli in this season's Champions League and it is the home side the light blue of City who
[6900.06 - 6907.74] P:1901.99 E:0.070098 |  come out on top two goals on the night the first a delicate little header that flicked over the top
[6907.74 - 6914.06] P:2033.33 E:0.081396 |  of the diving Malinkovic Savits from Erling Haaland as he notched up 50 goals in the Champions League
[6915.74 - 6922.94] P:1876.83 E:0.068287 |  in just 49 appearances and then Jeremy Dockoo seeing the space that nobody else could see
[6923.66 - 6929.42] P:1878.63 E:0.071493 |  bundling his way through it and with a really tight fit really nice finish from a tight angle
[6929.42 - 6933.58] P:1816.96 E:0.080286 |  through the legs of Malinkovic Savits but the game turned really in the first half
[6934.22 - 6938.06] P:1777.70 E:0.081010 |  it became a bit of a mountain to climb for Napoli when they had their captain sent off
[6939.42 - 6943.66] P:1858.10 E:0.074383 |  as he pulled down Erling Haaland denying the obvious goal scoring opportunity
[6945.26 - 6951.18] P:1705.05 E:0.068266 |  nothing the referee could do but brandish the red card and that made it a difficult night
[6951.26 - 6957.50] P:1790.00 E:0.076688 |  infinitely more tricky for Napoli and eventually Manchester City found a way to punish them
[6957.50 - 6964.78] P:1821.56 E:0.064038 |  and we can see Kevin De Bruyne out on the pitch with his former teammates all around him he is such
[6964.78 - 6971.74] P:1797.88 E:0.058257 |  a favourite here but it's not ended in joy tonight for De Bruyne on his return a few
[6972.86 - 6978.94] P:1818.58 E:0.067132 |  glum faces in the dark shirts of Napoli but Manchester City well deserving of their victory
[6979.90 - 6984.78] P:1803.81 E:0.077776 |  yeah extremely well deserved they put pressure on the momentum if they're passing
[6984.78 - 6990.54] P:1939.29 E:0.074054 |  good possession Napoli just decided to retreat and give City the ball said come and break
[6990.54 - 6996.22] P:1920.08 E:0.065241 |  three of us and they were finding it tough. Mike of his Savits in goal and some good saves and
[6996.22 - 7001.50] P:1800.24 E:0.074773 |  looked to have a great presence but the one decision where it went long into Haaland that
[7001.50 - 7007.10] P:1856.27 E:0.077138 |  he spun it behind the Lorenzo thought he had it made a decision to tackle and at that point the
[7007.10 - 7014.78] P:1897.57 E:0.075030 |  red card was given and it was always going to be uphill City completely moved the ball and dominated
[7014.78 - 7020.14] P:1851.25 E:0.086407 |  the rest of the game and that was all about Phil Forden Haaland Haaland with that lovely little
[7020.14 - 7026.86] P:1842.36 E:0.084758 |  depth header Dockoo the brilliance of wide players with pace running at people to finally get that
[7026.86 - 7034.14] P:1856.07 E:0.076958 |  goal and it was very easy in the end for City. The Napoli players go over to applaud their supporters
[7034.22 - 7039.26] P:1904.25 E:0.077221 |  who have been absolutely brilliant throughout the night they've been loud they've supported their
[7039.26 - 7045.98] P:1840.02 E:0.080409 |  team there is real positivity around Napoli after winning that title last season the reinforcements
[7045.98 - 7051.18] P:1798.32 E:0.091754 |  and strengthening that Antonio Conte has been able to do in the summer in terms of his squad
[7052.38 - 7057.82] P:1830.51 E:0.078525 |  they've won three out of three to start their season but it's because that runners come unstuck
[7057.82 - 7065.26] P:1875.02 E:0.068778 |  here at the Etihad but down to 10 men for so long in this game they will feel like they have seen
[7065.26 - 7070.38] P:1780.49 E:0.086955 |  their players give everything this evening and it will be back to Serie A back to defending their title
[7071.66 - 7078.78] P:1886.21 E:0.077474 |  before their Champions League trail continues next up for them a home tie against sporting
[7079.10 - 7087.90] P:1953.89 E:0.061950 |  but it is now all eyes on Kevin De Bruyne he's wandering around all four stands just now
[7087.90 - 7092.94] P:1950.42 E:0.081465 |  he's gone to the Napoli supporters with his team and now he's being given the opportunity to lead
[7092.94 - 7099.90] P:1897.06 E:0.075643 |  the line amazing to lead the Manchester City players to applaud all the home fans that are left
[7099.90 - 7105.90] P:1873.45 E:0.085845 |  inside the stadium it's a beautiful sight it's like he's the captain leading Manchester City around
[7105.90 - 7110.38] P:1906.16 E:0.097420 |  on their lap of honour this is and now he's almost thinking i've got to leave them a little bit get
[7110.38 - 7117.26] P:1947.41 E:0.081772 |  forward because i might have done this too much but legends players of the game you've had mired
[7118.14 - 7122.38] P:1871.69 E:0.097407 |  it's a sad day now i thought i'd already said that once before i won't see him again
[7122.38 - 7128.30] P:1791.01 E:0.083399 |  here at the Etihad and it's going to get less and less that percentage of doing so well the smiles

[7154.38 - 7161.74] P:1889.41 E:0.078906 |  Antonio Conte no emotion in those sorts of decisions made by the Italian boss and now Kevin

[7166.86 - 7171.58] P:1736.39 E:0.087930 |  last time he has been able to do it one more time and he's now followed by all the Manchester
