[0.00 - 3.12] P:1781.82 E:0.031785 |  And commentary continues on Sports Extra.
[3.12 - 7.20] P:1938.60 E:0.092502 |  Our stall are in their red and white shirts and white shorts.
[7.20 - 11.08] P:1908.24 E:0.108603 |  Real Madrid are in their change outfit. They're in all grey.
[13.08 - 18.32] P:1961.44 E:0.102607 |  As our referee is Irfan Pioto from Bosnia.
[18.32 - 22.80] P:1928.37 E:0.101976 |  He's just checking with his fourth official that they're ready to go,
[22.80 - 25.44] P:1892.54 E:0.087847 |  but he's whistle and he's in his mouth.
[25.44 - 29.36] P:1989.71 E:0.106269 |  This is BBC Radio 5 Live and the BBC sounds up.
[29.48 - 35.12] P:1985.10 E:0.101037 |  And we are under way for the first of three nights of live European action.
[35.12 - 37.64] P:1909.29 E:0.085906 |  And what a cracker to get us under way.
[37.64 - 42.16] P:2023.87 E:0.086704 |  Arsenal against the European champions, Real Madrid.
[42.16 - 47.20] P:1980.28 E:0.089330 |  Arsenal who were unbeaten in the first leg of all of their seven
[47.20 - 50.92] P:1867.56 E:0.088710 |  previous Champions League quarterfinals
[50.92 - 56.44] P:1877.75 E:0.093274 |  against a Real Madrid side who have progressed in all seven
[56.44 - 59.84] P:1906.80 E:0.091913 |  Champions League quarterfinals against England.
[60.84 - 64.68] P:1941.73 E:0.101703 |  Might not necessarily give tonight, but it will in a week's time.
[64.68 - 69.44] P:1971.17 E:0.088916 |  As Mbappe shoots from distance in a central area right footed,
[69.44 - 72.68] P:1911.88 E:0.089191 |  bounced a couple of times before it reached David Raya.
[72.68 - 76.52] P:1871.15 E:0.090586 |  But there was an early warning sign from killing Mbappe,
[76.52 - 81.12] P:1960.07 E:0.095577 |  who incidentally has scored 10 goals in 16 Champions League games
[81.12 - 82.52] P:1880.91 E:0.102493 |  against English opposition.
[82.52 - 85.44] P:1920.51 E:0.104693 |  Unbelievable, isn't it? The numbers this guy puts up.
[85.44 - 89.92] P:1940.98 E:0.083869 |  But I just love coming and watching these Champions League games.
[89.92 - 93.76] P:1954.10 E:0.089428 |  We all think that it's about the football and the technical ability.
[93.76 - 96.04] P:1946.38 E:0.096491 |  I'll tell you what, the work rate, the physicality,
[96.04 - 98.32] P:1937.43 E:0.086007 |  the way this game started, it went back,
[98.32 - 101.84] P:1894.89 E:0.099133 |  Real Madrid launched it long into Alibaba at the left-back position,
[101.84 - 104.48] P:1790.35 E:0.105454 |  running forward to win the header, smashes it down.
[104.48 - 105.92] P:1795.84 E:0.099061 |  It's so physical.
[105.92 - 110.16] P:1886.40 E:0.099223 |  And it's about that ability to fight and scrap and through the ugly things.
[110.16 - 113.00] P:1897.96 E:0.110614 |  This Champions League football is very much about that this season
[113.04 - 115.00] P:1901.04 E:0.108851 |  and it really is shown here this evening.
[115.00 - 118.60] P:1997.91 E:0.100446 |  Erdogan against his former club runs forward towards Saka.
[118.60 - 121.20] P:1985.25 E:0.095148 |  What an ovation he got against Fulham a week ago.
[121.20 - 123.80] P:1976.16 E:0.094852 |  He actually said himself yesterday,
[123.80 - 126.84] P:1944.95 E:0.089334 |  you have to be inside the stadium to appreciate it.
[126.84 - 129.16] P:1858.67 E:0.112181 |  There was just so much love and warmth,
[129.16 - 133.72] P:1970.92 E:0.100046 |  as Lewis Skelly is fouled and Arsenal get a free kick forward
[133.72 - 137.44] P:1925.04 E:0.089919 |  of the centre-circle as they play from left to right,
[137.44 - 140.60] P:1949.08 E:0.094896 |  as we look here, on BBC Radio 5 Live.
[140.64 - 143.44] P:2003.74 E:0.101982 |  We'll also keep you in touch with five-live final score,
[144.88 - 146.36] P:1922.87 E:0.104297 |  which is available on the red button.
[146.36 - 148.88] P:1935.89 E:0.108471 |  The iPlayer and the BBC sport out with the goals
[148.88 - 150.32] P:1905.59 E:0.107413 |  as they've gone in around the country.
[150.32 - 153.84] P:1967.92 E:0.091779 |  Saka encouraged to run at Alibaba to Erdogan,
[153.84 - 157.32] P:1965.44 E:0.091998 |  lays it off towards Timber, rolls it back down the line to Erdogan.
[157.32 - 159.88] P:1982.74 E:0.100490 |  Timber goes as a decoy run on the overlap,
[159.88 - 162.96] P:1957.35 E:0.082759 |  then complains to Erdogan that he wasn't utilised.
[162.96 - 165.48] P:1976.08 E:0.101403 |  And then Erdogan tries to thread it through towards Saka
[165.48 - 167.24] P:1935.57 E:0.085841 |  on the edge of the penalty area.
[167.24 - 169.40] P:1936.30 E:0.116996 |  Moderates his clearance, goes straight to Erdogan,
[169.40 - 171.64] P:1892.86 E:0.085122 |  wasn't expecting it, and there is Bellingham.
[171.64 - 173.72] P:1907.96 E:0.107200 |  As the challenge comes in on Bellingham from Timber,
[173.72 - 175.24] P:1870.04 E:0.121209 |  and Arsenal win the ball there,
[175.24 - 178.96] P:1933.30 E:0.105024 |  and Moderates chops down Saka, right corner of the area,
[178.96 - 180.76] P:1994.29 E:0.093107 |  free kick to Arsenal.
[180.76 - 183.92] P:1964.38 E:0.112237 |  Middles for a 0-leads one, Blackburn 0, Sheffield Wednesday one,
[183.92 - 187.16] P:1885.18 E:0.105933 |  Chesterfield 0, Jillingham 1, Bolton 0, Rotherham 1,
[187.16 - 189.88] P:1906.48 E:0.115655 |  Mansfield lead late-nourished by Goulton and a lead 1.
[189.88 - 192.56] P:1912.56 E:0.106539 |  Well, that tackle from Timber on Bellingham
[192.56 - 194.04] P:1885.60 E:0.114119 |  really has got the crowd up.
[194.04 - 195.68] P:1941.19 E:0.080750 |  What a challenge it was.
[195.68 - 197.88] P:1955.00 E:0.102769 |  Bellingham didn't see him come, and he came along the side
[197.88 - 201.00] P:1957.72 E:0.081693 |  and just absolutely smashed into him, won the ball.
[201.00 - 203.40] P:1932.66 E:0.075614 |  Bellingham goes to ground, and then...
[203.40 - 206.52] P:1944.44 E:0.099312 |  I think it's Saka just drives with it and draws the foul,
[206.52 - 209.16] P:1915.54 E:0.090046 |  and they've got a free kick wide now.
[209.16 - 213.08] P:2006.57 E:0.086010 |  It's about five or six yards just wide of the corner
[213.08 - 216.88] P:1987.97 E:0.100686 |  of the 18-yard box, and Martin Odegaard standing over the ball
[216.88 - 219.92] P:2011.24 E:0.089190 |  with his left foot ready to whip this one in.
[219.92 - 223.60] P:1941.33 E:0.090902 |  First big challenge for Real Madrid in the set-piece department.
[223.60 - 227.84] P:1923.79 E:0.096210 |  Yes, an early chance for Arsenal now to test Real Madrid.
[227.88 - 230.00] P:1906.15 E:0.082239 |  They've got two in the wall.
[230.00 - 232.52] P:1978.20 E:0.085018 |  Courtoires poised.
[232.52 - 236.08] P:1891.29 E:0.105391 |  There are four Arsenal players who now make a run in from that far side.
[236.08 - 241.52] P:1962.04 E:0.083337 |  Odegaard hits it in low, but it was cleared up in the air.
[241.52 - 244.48] P:1949.45 E:0.105820 |  And now a break could be on here in the Spenicius Junior,
[244.48 - 246.92] P:1966.16 E:0.097158 |  and he's streaking forward and he's running into space,
[246.92 - 249.20] P:1984.99 E:0.100329 |  and he's carried the ball into the penalty area,
[249.20 - 252.16] P:1988.66 E:0.105821 |  and then he hit it with such pace with the outside of his right boot,
[252.16 - 254.44] P:1988.69 E:0.080613 |  took a big deflection off Saliba.
[254.44 - 256.64] P:1866.04 E:0.089907 |  Actually, that was a wicked deflection.
[256.64 - 259.08] P:1889.69 E:0.093898 |  In the end, Raya had to make sure he was well positioned.
[259.08 - 261.48] P:1936.74 E:0.099634 |  Yeah, he's just trying to feed it into the path of Mbappe,
[261.48 - 264.48] P:1940.61 E:0.084193 |  who had made a lightning fast break over the far side.
[264.48 - 266.36] P:1979.43 E:0.107994 |  Saliba actually does really well.
[266.36 - 269.04] P:1893.02 E:0.078869 |  It's a poor mistake from party to give the ball away,
[269.04 - 271.36] P:1898.35 E:0.085691 |  but he doesn't commit Saliba.
[271.36 - 273.76] P:1972.99 E:0.085751 |  He just forces the hand of Spenicius Junior
[273.76 - 275.56] P:1918.42 E:0.089839 |  to actually have to make a decision,
[275.56 - 278.40] P:1940.87 E:0.094809 |  holds his position and gets a good deflection on the ball.
[278.40 - 280.96] P:1905.05 E:0.102356 |  I mentioned that Leeds United had taken the lead at the riverside.
[280.96 - 282.20] P:1721.00 E:0.088488 |  News of it from Rob Law.
[282.20 - 283.76] P:2014.43 E:0.106897 |  Perfect start. Two minutes in,
[283.76 - 286.00] P:1995.77 E:0.109951 |  Manon Solomon with a low cross into the area,
[286.00 - 288.12] P:2069.74 E:0.101425 |  bundled in by Dan James.
[288.12 - 289.84] P:1770.54 E:0.091755 |  It's Middlesbrough, Neal Leeds-1.
[289.84 - 292.00] P:1775.30 E:0.106805 |  Birmingham City could be promoted tonight in League One.
[292.00 - 293.92] P:1837.88 E:0.092748 |  There's been a goal at London Road, Nathan Alvin.
[293.92 - 297.84] P:2067.80 E:0.100525 |  They're on their way in Birmingham with a one-goal lead here at Peterborough,
[297.84 - 301.52] P:1960.02 E:0.086798 |  across from the left, Alfie May heading in via the crossbar.
[301.52 - 303.00] P:1897.31 E:0.101870 |  Peterborough, Neal, Birmingham-1.
[303.00 - 306.68] P:1869.72 E:0.099864 |  And Preston Leeds-Cardiff by a goal to Neal in the championship.
[306.68 - 310.40] P:1856.15 E:0.089075 |  Cardiff, who was struggling, but Preston going very, very well at home.
[310.40 - 312.36] P:1810.61 E:0.099518 |  Arsenal, Neal-Neal here against Real Madrid.
[312.36 - 314.72] P:1870.11 E:0.096516 |  BBC Radio 5 live, and the BBC sounds out.
[314.72 - 316.32] P:1859.30 E:0.060319 |  We're in the fifth minute.
[316.32 - 320.84] P:1842.33 E:0.098034 |  And there's going to be a throw-in to Arsenal on that left-hand side,
[320.84 - 326.52] P:1887.15 E:0.086059 |  that Miles Lewis-Skelly will just eventually wander forward to take.
[327.52 - 330.52] P:1917.05 E:0.090232 |  There's been a couple of loose passes early in this game, hasn't there?
[330.52 - 333.04] P:1909.11 E:0.091202 |  A couple of little mistakes on the ball from both teams.
[333.04 - 334.24] P:2021.78 E:0.089060 |  In it goes.
[334.24 - 337.28] P:1934.78 E:0.101952 |  Cut out by Camarvinga, voled away by Camarvinga.
[337.28 - 340.00] P:1954.40 E:0.113335 |  Giviardo is closed down on Mbappe.
[340.00 - 342.24] P:1909.40 E:0.097145 |  Erdogan spreads it out towards Saka.
[342.24 - 344.04] P:1902.79 E:0.094377 |  Saka with a chance to run.
[344.04 - 346.04] P:1930.15 E:0.112472 |  Right side of the area, plays it in low.
[346.04 - 347.28] P:1929.74 E:0.111617 |  Nobody there!
[347.28 - 351.16] P:1918.24 E:0.110824 |  And in the end, it actually came off an outstretched leg of Rudiger.
[351.16 - 353.84] P:1937.28 E:0.110935 |  And it's skewed behind for a corner kick.
[353.84 - 356.12] P:1927.78 E:0.098050 |  Will quickly nip to Sheffield United. Tom Gale.
[359.44 - 361.76] P:1858.38 E:0.115841 |  Four up, eight yards out, turns and smashes.
[361.76 - 363.36] P:1639.24 E:0.108826 |  Their first attempt on goal.
[363.36 - 365.56] P:1838.94 E:0.109610 |  Sheffield United, Neal, Mill-1-1.
[365.56 - 369.52] P:1894.11 E:0.086116 |  Now, that is an upset for Sheffield United.
[369.52 - 372.64] P:1957.49 E:0.089604 |  They've only lost back-to-back games once all season.
[372.64 - 375.20] P:1874.43 E:0.078666 |  They were beaten at Oxford at the weekend.
[375.20 - 376.88] P:1855.01 E:0.089919 |  But here it's Neal Nill.
[378.20 - 381.56] P:1904.39 E:0.088133 |  And Saka waits to take the corner kick.
[382.92 - 384.44] P:1840.10 E:0.082257 |  Takes his time.
[384.44 - 386.16] P:1817.31 E:0.097758 |  Takes one.
[386.16 - 388.04] P:1921.53 E:0.088157 |  Deep breath.
[388.04 - 389.76] P:1944.83 E:0.084959 |  Shoulders now drop.
[389.76 - 391.88] P:1955.72 E:0.114872 |  In it goes. In swing, a court-to-art.
[391.88 - 393.64] P:1968.08 E:0.089370 |  Auckland won for it.
[393.64 - 395.36] P:1961.53 E:0.114749 |  Had to punch him behind for another corner.
[395.36 - 397.60] P:1934.05 E:0.097353 |  I'm looking at the position around Madrid
[397.60 - 399.84] P:1919.90 E:0.099860 |  and that doesn't look comfortable to me at all.
[399.84 - 403.32] P:1861.69 E:0.091305 |  I mean, they're very zonal, Arsenal players,
[403.32 - 407.44] P:1935.06 E:0.097772 |  party, Saliba, Timber all dropping
[407.44 - 409.64] P:1942.61 E:0.107056 |  beyond the back of the six-yard box line.
[409.64 - 412.48] P:1816.47 E:0.106158 |  And they make this lovely little kind of running unison.
[412.48 - 414.24] P:1766.93 E:0.100428 |  But they're on the move, attacking the ball,
[414.24 - 415.48] P:1913.13 E:0.082794 |  and there's a standing defender.
[415.48 - 417.56] P:1898.70 E:0.077055 |  You're a sitting duck in that situation.
[417.56 - 419.52] P:1948.29 E:0.091452 |  Again, settering run-up from Saka.
[419.52 - 422.24] P:1902.73 E:0.112620 |  Another left footed corner kick into Altenair post.
[422.24 - 423.36] P:1940.70 E:0.108983 |  Around the drift, get it away.
[423.36 - 425.72] P:1986.61 E:0.086312 |  But again, that was hearts and mouth time
[425.72 - 427.60] P:2006.01 E:0.087661 |  for the European champions.
[427.60 - 431.76] P:1948.23 E:0.086866 |  Now, Vinicius Jr. in field, helped on its way by Mbappe.
[431.76 - 434.00] P:1974.31 E:0.106481 |  Out towards Rodrigo over on that far side,
[434.00 - 436.12] P:1835.06 E:0.089744 |  the right playing from right to left.
[436.12 - 439.84] P:1984.14 E:0.104380 |  And the Arsenal supporters as Real Madrid go back with Camarvinga.
[439.84 - 443.04] P:1917.39 E:0.098057 |  Now towards Moderic, the Real Madrid captain.
[443.04 - 448.08] P:1952.20 E:0.102481 |  Out towards Aliba, they will try and slow it down as Moderic,
[448.08 - 449.76] P:2025.90 E:0.111902 |  just inside the Arsenal half.
[449.76 - 451.76] P:1918.48 E:0.090483 |  Another goal in Belgium, Flo Pollock.
[451.76 - 453.16] P:1887.98 E:0.115726 |  England have a goal back.
[453.16 - 454.96] P:1859.16 E:0.092475 |  Bethany from the penalty spot.
[454.96 - 456.96] P:1826.32 E:0.096414 |  Belgium three, England one.
[457.80 - 459.92] P:1887.77 E:0.109877 |  Coventry continues on sports extra.
[459.92 - 463.56] P:1919.61 E:0.105736 |  Vinicius Jr. still at a walking pace for Real Madrid.
[463.56 - 465.52] P:1805.15 E:0.104946 |  Gets the ball back there from...
[465.52 - 468.08] P:1851.32 E:0.117643 |  from Belgium, and then Moderic hits the ball over the top,
[468.08 - 469.00] P:1738.72 E:0.100926 |  and Ryder is coming.
[469.00 - 471.92] P:1910.80 E:0.102662 |  Gatryer gathers that ball before it can reach Mbappe.
[471.92 - 473.92] P:1835.25 E:0.112849 |  Another goal at London Road, Nathan Elbin.
[473.92 - 475.92] P:1952.65 E:0.101676 |  And it's an equaliser for Pita Burra.
[475.92 - 477.72] P:2012.44 E:0.098888 |  Pita Burra won, Birmingham won.
[477.72 - 480.44] P:1914.00 E:0.085721 |  Corner from the right, fell for Kwame Pocco.
[480.44 - 482.88] P:2024.26 E:0.089991 |  Edge of the penalty area, slammed it into the net.
[482.88 - 484.36] P:1941.12 E:0.093606 |  Pita Burra won, Birmingham won.
[484.36 - 485.76] P:1900.51 E:0.095586 |  Nil Nil in the Champions League.
[485.76 - 487.32] P:1764.85 E:0.099067 |  Tomorrow night we're live in Paris.
[487.36 - 489.24] P:1925.98 E:0.096771 |  Paris-Saint-Germain against Aston Villa.
[489.24 - 492.16] P:1886.06 E:0.102096 |  Lyon Manchester United in the Europa League quarter-finals.
[492.16 - 495.16] P:1924.38 E:0.097407 |  On Thursday night you'll hear here on five-live as Rice
[495.16 - 497.68] P:1923.93 E:0.089855 |  wanders across the walls that far side the left.
[497.68 - 499.40] P:1907.96 E:0.083957 |  Just in from the touch line.
[499.40 - 502.60] P:1822.32 E:0.095836 |  Real Madrid, even Mbappe coming back to help out now.
[502.60 - 506.72] P:1871.05 E:0.094787 |  Back it goes out towards Martinelli now, on the left-hand side.
[506.72 - 508.36] P:1927.00 E:0.112867 |  Luis Scali forward ball.
[508.36 - 513.44] P:1935.34 E:0.084388 |  Rice are knocked with a cutback off the body of Ascensio.
[513.44 - 516.36] P:1860.90 E:0.092293 |  And now Valberdi picks it up for Real Madrid.
[516.40 - 518.44] P:1878.80 E:0.101540 |  And Mbappe able to turn,
[518.44 - 521.08] P:1946.07 E:0.103423 |  skips over the challenge of Erdogan, and he's away.
[521.08 - 525.56] P:1919.48 E:0.087108 |  He's got Alibar and Vinicius Jr to this near side, the left.
[525.56 - 528.24] P:1962.55 E:0.099403 |  Alibar touches the ball to Vinicius Jr.
[528.24 - 532.08] P:1925.97 E:0.115355 |  Runs forward, delivers across, but in the end it goes over the angle
[532.08 - 534.48] P:1895.19 E:0.095599 |  of that near post, and out for a goal kick,
[534.48 - 536.52] P:1740.66 E:0.100412 |  and it remains 0-0, eight and a half minutes play.
[536.52 - 539.12] P:1705.04 E:0.099783 |  Yeah, he's never going to really wrap his foot around that one.
[539.12 - 541.68] P:1854.15 E:0.098293 |  Vinicius Jr. at full tilt on his left foot,
[541.68 - 545.28] P:1921.25 E:0.097643 |  trying to cross the ball, just strikes it very flat and clean,
[545.32 - 548.52] P:1868.66 E:0.094587 |  but always rising high and over to the back post.
[548.52 - 550.56] P:1896.29 E:0.087348 |  But Arsenal started well here.
[550.56 - 553.60] P:1875.86 E:0.088891 |  They're no really positive start from the home team,
[553.60 - 556.48] P:1838.06 E:0.083517 |  been aggressive, been first to the ball,
[556.48 - 559.92] P:1919.24 E:0.085391 |  and a couple of set pieces that really, looking at the replay,
[559.92 - 562.32] P:1912.28 E:0.103086 |  I think Thomas' party was unsighted on that last one.
[562.32 - 563.60] P:1835.64 E:0.094415 |  It was landing right on his head.
[563.60 - 565.96] P:1889.00 E:0.090733 |  Any kind of contact in the near post,
[565.96 - 567.28] P:1767.45 E:0.099672 |  the ball had been in the back of the net.
[567.28 - 570.72] P:1874.62 E:0.090159 |  That, for me, is their biggest threat in this game, Arsenal.
[570.72 - 574.08] P:1868.95 E:0.107146 |  Set pieces, they've already had a couple of corners,
[574.12 - 576.36] P:1836.12 E:0.112902 |  early doors as well, they've had a free kick,
[576.36 - 580.68] P:1793.39 E:0.101719 |  but it remains goalless as we take our way into the 10th minute.
[580.68 - 583.72] P:1856.18 E:0.108709 |  Luca Moderic, by the way, he first played Arsenal,
[583.72 - 587.04] P:1784.42 E:0.092225 |  for Dino Mosa Greb in 2006,
[587.04 - 589.80] P:1902.07 E:0.095934 |  34 days before Lewis Skelly was born.
[591.68 - 593.04] P:1770.60 E:0.086598 |  What a player.
[593.04 - 597.04] P:1844.85 E:0.089998 |  You know, you run out of kind of compliments, really, don't you,
[597.04 - 599.52] P:1790.05 E:0.097308 |  for how he plays the game, the shape he keeps himself in,
[599.52 - 602.80] P:1801.87 E:0.089975 |  and the ability to still maintain that at this level
[602.80 - 604.32] P:1857.89 E:0.083217 |  is just remarkable.
[604.32 - 608.12] P:1872.07 E:0.097406 |  Yeah, this is his 48th appearance of the season
[608.12 - 612.56] P:1902.01 E:0.101867 |  for somebody who is 39 and still as good as ever.
[612.56 - 618.24] P:1904.00 E:0.093654 |  Erdogan, who still remains the youngest ever player for Real Madrid
[618.24 - 622.32] P:1908.42 E:0.098579 |  during his time there, 16 years and 157 days
[622.32 - 625.76] P:1869.31 E:0.104655 |  when he made his debut against the Tafe in 2015,
[625.76 - 628.36] P:1901.47 E:0.098917 |  which incidentally was Carlo Ancelotti's final game,
[628.36 - 631.64] P:1921.67 E:0.096577 |  and his first spell in charge is Martin Ali sends over across,
[631.68 - 634.20] P:1897.60 E:0.093087 |  and Alibar is tucked in at left back.
[634.20 - 636.80] P:1969.10 E:0.110827 |  And Bapé tried to play it early to Vinicius Jr.
[636.80 - 639.56] P:1858.93 E:0.094117 |  That was an important block by Saliba,
[639.56 - 641.72] P:1956.69 E:0.121663 |  because otherwise Vinicius Jr. could have been away.
[641.72 - 644.20] P:1936.11 E:0.080820 |  That's always the danger. You can never switch off.
[644.20 - 645.76] P:1860.75 E:0.086739 |  Those two are just on it, Dino.
[645.76 - 648.56] P:1798.25 E:0.086631 |  I have to say, you know, that ball's bouncing.
[648.56 - 651.12] P:1956.66 E:0.098667 |  They've got a real understanding in it, and guess what?
[651.12 - 652.84] P:1940.96 E:0.071544 |  It's all about pace, isn't it?
[652.84 - 654.80] P:1944.77 E:0.100197 |  They know each other so well,
[654.80 - 657.12] P:1818.66 E:0.097879 |  they know how lightning-quick each player is,
[657.12 - 658.96] P:1772.68 E:0.093392 |  and whenever they've got a chance to get to the ball first,
[658.96 - 661.88] P:1795.89 E:0.101392 |  even if they're hooking it over the top, over the fullback,
[661.88 - 664.96] P:1794.16 E:0.091659 |  into the space, it's just big trouble for Arsenal at that point.
[664.96 - 668.48] P:1846.64 E:0.108459 |  Alibar back towards Rudiger, floats the ball forward,
[668.48 - 671.96] P:1910.17 E:0.091703 |  Timberlowe steps forward and gets there before Vinicius Jr.
[671.96 - 674.68] P:1858.57 E:0.118063 |  And will get a throw to Arsenal on this near side.
[676.24 - 678.12] P:1903.35 E:0.106723 |  The assistant referee, I thought for a minute
[678.12 - 681.64] P:1803.83 E:0.097069 |  was waiting to see what the referee was going to tell him to do,
[681.64 - 683.64] P:1935.96 E:0.093203 |  but he was having a good old ponder,
[683.64 - 686.00] P:1844.87 E:0.110507 |  and in the end he raised his right arm,
[686.00 - 687.84] P:1787.56 E:0.105737 |  and the flag went up for an Arsenal throw,
[687.84 - 689.84] P:1774.19 E:0.093092 |  as they played from left to right,
[689.84 - 693.28] P:1836.06 E:0.095346 |  11 minutes into this game in the Champions League.
[693.28 - 695.04] P:1932.46 E:0.111895 |  You can see the Real Madrid supporters
[695.04 - 697.64] P:1882.11 E:0.090038 |  celebrating on the far side, you just can't hear them.
[697.64 - 700.16] P:1882.89 E:0.102634 |  They filled that bottom quadrant with their white shirts.
[700.16 - 702.68] P:1885.27 E:0.101923 |  Timber stumbles, but then goes to down.
[702.68 - 703.92] P:1913.10 E:0.099768 |  Canovinga. That's a dive.
[703.92 - 707.48] P:1785.03 E:0.099770 |  There was no foul, and the referee had a good view of that.
[707.48 - 709.08] P:1816.34 E:0.080552 |  It was a dive. Got it.
[709.08 - 710.56] P:1916.93 E:0.077451 |  It looked a dive, didn't it?
[710.56 - 713.92] P:1725.52 E:0.083547 |  Timber trying to buy the foul, very direct.
[713.92 - 715.88] P:1866.98 E:0.089345 |  He started the game, he's going at players,
[715.92 - 717.92] P:1687.07 E:0.083194 |  he's running at people with the ball,
[717.92 - 720.40] P:1852.02 E:0.094560 |  which I don't mind, it's a little bit clumsy at times,
[720.40 - 723.72] P:1896.02 E:0.096381 |  but I don't mind it because it actually really does cause problems
[723.72 - 727.72] P:1897.26 E:0.092375 |  for defenders, and Canovinga does put his arms around Timber,
[727.72 - 729.72] P:1836.23 E:0.098350 |  but then he just collapses to the floor in a heap
[729.72 - 731.88] P:1876.85 E:0.070096 |  under very little pressure.
[731.88 - 733.24] P:1913.40 E:0.105953 |  What was it, Carl-I'm-short?
[733.24 - 737.24] P:1976.45 E:0.089872 |  Camshawas said yesterday, he said knowledge and experience
[737.24 - 740.24] P:1886.61 E:0.094259 |  means that we're not afraid to play these type of games,
[740.24 - 745.12] P:1863.04 E:0.082025 |  and their record would bear fruit when it comes to...
[746.24 - 749.00] P:1910.37 E:0.102100 |  This sort of stage of the Champions League campaign.
[749.00 - 752.00] P:1871.27 E:0.091719 |  You know, they might have finished 11th in the league phase,
[752.00 - 754.20] P:1837.02 E:0.092104 |  but they've got the know-how, the expertise,
[754.20 - 757.20] P:1903.02 E:0.097951 |  haven't they, to see themselves through when it comes to the knockout stage?
[757.20 - 759.88] P:1843.14 E:0.087368 |  It's just like they start the competition in like, OK.
[759.88 - 761.60] P:1870.84 E:0.087016 |  Yeah. All right.
[761.60 - 764.88] P:1872.34 E:0.112896 |  You know, in that kind of mode, then by the time you get to the quarterfinals,
[764.88 - 767.44] P:1918.07 E:0.114504 |  you know, they really do turn it on.
[767.44 - 770.40] P:1888.22 E:0.110068 |  Lewis Skelly drops his shoulder away from Rodrigo.
[770.40 - 772.40] P:1894.44 E:0.103706 |  Rice helps it out towards Martinelli,
[772.40 - 775.80] P:1841.87 E:0.102139 |  Martinelli attacking down towards the buy line, plays it back in.
[775.84 - 777.00] P:1798.85 E:0.111382 |  Marina pulls it back.
[777.00 - 777.88] P:1818.14 E:0.111100 |  Party!
[777.88 - 779.36] P:1817.69 E:0.108697 |  Spilled by Courtois!
[780.64 - 782.24] P:1908.72 E:0.128060 |  He hits it low right, 14.
[782.24 - 784.96] P:1877.55 E:0.113566 |  It was straight out before the Chelsea goalkeeper.
[784.96 - 787.48] P:1870.03 E:0.112208 |  But again, promising signs for Arsenal,
[787.48 - 789.64] P:1971.58 E:0.104824 |  and the Arsenal fans respond to it as well.
[789.64 - 791.64] P:1859.64 E:0.089010 |  Well, it may have been straight out, Courtois,
[791.64 - 794.40] P:1825.45 E:0.104627 |  but I'll tell you what, that went through a lot of bodies to get there.
[794.40 - 798.28] P:1746.19 E:0.097212 |  That could have took a ricochet or a little nick of anyone's foot or ankle.
[798.28 - 801.24] P:1869.18 E:0.120063 |  Luckily for Courtois, it was right along the line of the ball,
[801.24 - 803.72] P:1905.73 E:0.092676 |  but really good play from Arsenal.
[803.72 - 808.08] P:1738.77 E:0.095986 |  Very direct, very positive, Martinelli running out Valverde,
[808.08 - 811.28] P:1875.85 E:0.080097 |  who you feel you will have, you know, the beating for Pace
[811.28 - 813.00] P:1774.94 E:0.091619 |  if he gets the right side of him.
[814.00 - 816.08] P:1871.91 E:0.111501 |  13 appearances against Real Madrid
[816.08 - 819.28] P:1822.05 E:0.096977 |  for the former Atletico Madrid player, Thomas Pate.
[819.28 - 822.80] P:1821.35 E:0.093908 |  Only had two successes during that time.
[822.80 - 827.24] P:1823.24 E:0.095119 |  You certainly got the impression that if it was either side,
[827.24 - 831.48] P:1811.73 E:0.099000 |  and hold on, there is a potential penalty check for a VAR at the moment,
[831.52 - 837.56] P:1802.43 E:0.099726 |  so the corner kick that Modric waits to take away towards our left-hand side,
[837.56 - 838.84] P:1754.78 E:0.096677 |  there is a delay.
[841.08 - 842.32] P:1837.23 E:0.114752 |  Would that be...
[842.32 - 846.40] P:1857.97 E:0.092918 |  Is it the other end? A potential handball against Asensio.
[846.40 - 849.20] P:1863.91 E:0.089432 |  That's ridiculous, what I've just seen on there.
[849.20 - 852.96] P:1803.80 E:0.103280 |  I mean, that's unbelievable, seeing him being looked at, to be honest.
[852.96 - 856.40] P:1898.66 E:0.102477 |  I mean, Asensio is in a position, yes, the ball strikes his arm,
[856.40 - 859.84] P:1917.19 E:0.091489 |  but it's not even a yard away from him,
[859.84 - 862.60] P:1931.65 E:0.091631 |  and his arm is down by his side, I mean...
[864.00 - 866.44] P:1870.97 E:0.117191 |  Bastion-Danckers is the VAR official,
[866.44 - 870.40] P:1915.65 E:0.101921 |  so we've got a Bosnian referee, but a German VAR official.
[870.40 - 873.40] P:1941.43 E:0.089401 |  Yes, it's Crossford-Martinelli.
[873.40 - 875.48] P:1949.85 E:0.105217 |  Rice gets their first side-foot to the ball,
[875.48 - 879.48] P:1925.33 E:0.092756 |  but Asensio is a yard away with his arm down by his side,
[879.48 - 882.76] P:1886.03 E:0.088121 |  and the ball does hit it, but he's just blocking the ball.
[882.76 - 885.40] P:1822.94 E:0.111731 |  But also, what is he, a yard away from him?
[885.40 - 887.12] P:1838.70 E:0.089552 |  Not even that, I don't even think it's a yard.
[887.12 - 888.16] P:1864.48 E:0.085552 |  They must have dismissed it,
[888.16 - 891.24] P:1854.05 E:0.103401 |  because there's a referee's whistle for Real Madrid corner kick at the other end.
[891.24 - 892.24] P:1874.91 E:0.101049 |  Crazy.
[892.24 - 893.72] P:2011.04 E:0.094880 |  Although there's some pushing and shoving.
[893.72 - 897.92] P:1877.04 E:0.086399 |  I should just warn you, though, that this referee, Erpán Pioto from Bosnia,
[897.92 - 902.60] P:1861.57 E:0.094381 |  no referee has awarded more penalties in the Champions League this season than him.
[902.60 - 906.08] P:1887.92 E:0.091576 |  They've got to sort the handball out in this competition, I have to say.
[906.08 - 911.40] P:1893.66 E:0.092808 |  It's hard, the Premier League's miles ahead of UEFA rules when it comes to handball.
[911.40 - 915.32] P:1887.50 E:0.105928 |  Moderates for the corner kick for Real Madrid, punched away by David Ryer.
[915.44 - 920.40] P:1857.08 E:0.097936 |  Miquel Arteza says, get those red and white shirts out, as Camo Vinga puts his left foot on the ball,
[920.40 - 922.24] P:1917.23 E:0.107694 |  just outside the centre-circle.
[922.24 - 926.64] P:1855.05 E:0.091147 |  Almost showed Valverde short there as Martinelli was prepared to nip in.
[926.64 - 929.84] P:1793.59 E:0.091303 |  And Bapé now comes in off that right search line.
[929.84 - 934.24] P:1839.00 E:0.100335 |  And Bapé reaches the right corner of the area, out towards Rodrigo.
[934.24 - 937.48] P:1885.90 E:0.099202 |  Little flick there by Bapé, went behind Bellingham,
[937.48 - 940.96] P:1841.44 E:0.086219 |  forced Bellingham a little bit further wide, right, that he maybe would have liked.
[940.96 - 944.88] P:1725.61 E:0.107954 |  Valverde, who's filling in, because Carvajal, as well as Militá,
[944.92 - 947.12] P:1817.21 E:0.097565 |  they're both out with ACLs.
[947.12 - 951.68] P:1727.46 E:0.103186 |  Something that's really blighted Real Madrid in the last couple of years.
[951.68 - 953.68] P:1712.70 E:0.089771 |  15 minutes played, 0-0.
[955.04 - 960.20] P:1785.40 E:0.103680 |  BBC Radio 5 Live with exclusive live radio commentary here in the Emirates.
[960.20 - 964.40] P:1790.91 E:0.084707 |  Camo Vinga to Moderich, for the Tottenham player.
[964.40 - 967.08] P:1814.73 E:0.104363 |  Camo Vinga back out towards Valverde.
[967.08 - 971.12] P:1892.59 E:0.096975 |  Rodrigo waits inside the centre-circle.
[971.12 - 975.28] P:1858.11 E:0.113709 |  And Arsenal once again have just pushed Real Madrid a little bit further out.
[975.28 - 977.88] P:1815.69 E:0.094947 |  But by doing so, and they've squeezed up the pitch,
[977.88 - 982.76] P:1733.92 E:0.107397 |  you then leave that vast expanse of area for somebody like a Venetius Junior
[982.76 - 984.92] P:1671.34 E:0.076769 |  or a Bapé to run into.
[984.92 - 988.24] P:1849.39 E:0.097155 |  It's almost as if they are maybe trying to draw Arsenal out a little bit more.
[988.24 - 991.72] P:1695.48 E:0.094927 |  Yeah, I think that's the purpose of this controlled possession.
[991.72 - 996.48] P:1858.09 E:0.095488 |  I think it's just a matter of getting the balance right, to be honest.
[996.48 - 999.60] P:1910.11 E:0.093511 |  And Arsenal, getting after the ball, but not leaving too much space in.
[999.60 - 1001.92] P:1929.78 E:0.084900 |  You're going to rely a lot on your midfield players.
[1001.92 - 1005.72] P:1848.52 E:0.093626 |  If they can get pressure on the ball, get the players head down as a defender.
[1005.72 - 1009.68] P:1856.17 E:0.095714 |  It just gives you much more time and power to get your position right.
[1009.68 - 1012.84] P:1780.90 E:0.107961 |  So you cannot be too high or not be too deep.
[1012.84 - 1016.32] P:1882.81 E:0.113057 |  Rodrigo, noticed that his left leg is actually heavily strapped
[1016.32 - 1021.32] P:1880.24 E:0.101264 |  underneath those grey shorts of his, played all the ball back to Courtois.
[1021.32 - 1024.40] P:1829.85 E:0.094383 |  He's actually missed the last three games with a muscle injury.
[1024.40 - 1028.04] P:1920.53 E:0.105263 |  His last match was against his compatriot Lunin in the opposite goal
[1028.04 - 1032.64] P:1874.98 E:0.099987 |  when Spain played Ukraine, sorry, when Belgium played Ukraine,
[1032.64 - 1035.40] P:1898.71 E:0.089454 |  as Rudiger helps it out towards this to Alaba.
[1035.40 - 1038.88] P:1949.62 E:0.106570 |  Himself has only made a 12th appearance of the season
[1038.88 - 1040.64] P:1895.59 E:0.101276 |  after coming back from an ACL injury
[1040.64 - 1043.84] P:1857.81 E:0.100459 |  and Saka couldn't keep the ball in play on this near side of the right.
[1043.84 - 1045.88] P:1884.59 E:0.100385 |  So they do have defensive frailties, I think.
[1045.88 - 1047.68] P:1824.97 E:0.092680 |  You know, they have fitness concerns in defence.
[1047.68 - 1048.44] P:1921.39 E:0.090090 |  Absolutely.
[1048.44 - 1055.44] P:1898.47 E:0.078568 |  I mean, there's two, like you say, big white strappings on Rudiger and Alaba's knee.
[1055.44 - 1060.12] P:1885.62 E:0.096354 |  And you look at that and think, well, if Arsenal can push them hard physically,
[1060.12 - 1062.60] P:1898.87 E:0.095752 |  get amongst them, which they are doing in the start of this game,
[1062.60 - 1066.24] P:1896.94 E:0.086383 |  I mean, the thought of Arsenal dropping off and being cagey hasn't happened.
[1066.24 - 1070.68] P:1908.60 E:0.108163 |  They really have tried to squeeze and win the ball and put Real Madrid under pressure.
[1070.68 - 1072.68] P:1930.37 E:0.105235 |  They've done it really well.
[1074.20 - 1076.72] P:1802.94 E:0.108793 |  No other goals to tell you about on an important night,
[1076.72 - 1079.56] P:1835.68 E:0.093263 |  particularly in the championship, but Burnley, the leaders,
[1079.56 - 1082.48] P:1788.85 E:0.111759 |  still drawing 0-0 away at Derby County,
[1082.52 - 1085.00] P:1898.91 E:0.105373 |  Sheppard United, Nill, Nill-Wall-1.
[1085.00 - 1089.16] P:1872.42 E:0.088384 |  The third-place lead United are leading at Middlesbrough by a goal to Nill.
[1089.16 - 1092.08] P:1822.50 E:0.086612 |  Alaba from left back, infield two and Baphe.
[1092.08 - 1094.88] P:1973.18 E:0.112729 |  Laced off and it goes a long way back to Moderich,
[1094.88 - 1097.64] P:1922.62 E:0.104078 |  who was a judge to have been fouled by Erdogan.
[1097.64 - 1099.36] P:1944.74 E:0.100240 |  The two captains coming together,
[1099.36 - 1101.68] P:1892.95 E:0.097157 |  Erdogan complains to the Bosnian referee,
[1101.68 - 1103.04] P:1864.23 E:0.096959 |  free-kick to Real Madrid.
[1103.04 - 1105.20] P:1880.75 E:0.081119 |  That's better than the other goals.
[1105.20 - 1107.20] P:1900.74 E:0.098289 |  Halftime Belgium three, England one,
[1107.20 - 1110.96] P:1844.23 E:0.090796 |  a shocking result so far from England, conceded three goals.
[1110.96 - 1113.40] P:1854.67 E:0.081002 |  They've got to go back through Beth Mead from the penalties,
[1113.40 - 1115.56] P:1788.94 E:0.077610 |  but halftime, Belgium three, England one.
[1115.56 - 1118.88] P:1856.99 E:0.083668 |  Thank you, Flo. Commentary that is on sports extra.
[1118.88 - 1121.36] P:1904.22 E:0.098215 |  No, it's much better from Odegaard.
[1121.36 - 1124.04] P:1938.23 E:0.088584 |  The pressure that he put on there onto Moderich
[1124.04 - 1126.12] P:1922.23 E:0.112917 |  is going to have to really do that quickly.
[1126.12 - 1128.12] P:1996.30 E:0.113124 |  When he does squeeze the ball, it's great.
[1128.12 - 1130.12] P:1978.11 E:0.102375 |  Lewis Scali looks for the run of Martin Elling.
[1130.12 - 1133.64] P:1947.22 E:0.111825 |  Asensio comes across, makes good ground, slides in,
[1133.64 - 1136.32] P:1958.38 E:0.096300 |  well-timed challenge inside the penalty area.
[1136.32 - 1138.32] P:1949.69 E:0.107774 |  Out it goes, 4-8, throw.
[1139.32 - 1141.32] P:1846.51 E:0.088417 |  And then from that throw, pulled back.
[1141.32 - 1144.32] P:1908.68 E:0.093735 |  Thomas Pate runs down the left side of the penalty area.
[1144.32 - 1146.32] P:1861.96 E:0.095056 |  Moderich can run it clear.
[1146.32 - 1148.32] P:1966.64 E:0.111631 |  Challenge comes in from Declan Rice.
[1148.32 - 1150.32] P:2011.33 E:0.102762 |  The Arsenal supporters are up for it.
[1150.32 - 1152.32] P:1913.06 E:0.092565 |  They are creating a frenzied atmosphere.
[1152.32 - 1154.32] P:1902.67 E:0.086470 |  Yeah, it feels like that, doesn't it?
[1154.32 - 1156.32] P:1918.68 E:0.101630 |  I mean, it's good to see Raul Asensio
[1156.32 - 1159.32] P:1795.99 E:0.100088 |  centre-back for Real Madrid in the flesh for the first time.
[1159.32 - 1162.32] P:1855.65 E:0.099742 |  Got a talk around him as a top-young centre-back,
[1162.32 - 1165.32] P:1810.29 E:0.100621 |  top player in the Real Madrid team, looking very good,
[1165.32 - 1167.32] P:1832.96 E:0.098751 |  very much a defender.
[1167.32 - 1169.32] P:1849.42 E:0.094588 |  A couple of times he's dealt with the ball.
[1169.32 - 1172.32] P:1849.20 E:0.101913 |  It's no nonsense. Gets there, puts it in the third tier of the stand,
[1172.32 - 1174.32] P:1799.01 E:0.107565 |  or goes to ground and wins the ball.
[1174.32 - 1176.32] P:1869.88 E:0.096428 |  He's very much an out-and-out defender.
[1177.32 - 1179.32] P:1885.22 E:0.111453 |  Shrewsbury, bottom of league one.
[1179.32 - 1182.32] P:1826.41 E:0.097041 |  Without a win, an 11 have fallen behind to play off chasing Redding.
[1182.32 - 1184.32] P:1870.48 E:0.097442 |  Shrewsbury, no Redding, one as the latest score.
[1184.32 - 1187.32] P:1846.58 E:0.108299 |  Courtois has the ball at his feet inside his six-yard area.
[1188.32 - 1190.32] P:1872.74 E:0.103884 |  He plays the ball to Asensio.
[1190.32 - 1192.32] P:1889.44 E:0.096018 |  He's only 22 years of age.
[1192.32 - 1195.32] P:1857.58 E:0.099697 |  It's his breakthrough season in the Real Madrid first team.
[1195.32 - 1198.32] P:1912.53 E:0.104736 |  And indeed he was on the bench for Spain
[1198.32 - 1200.32] P:1860.45 E:0.110860 |  in their recent game against Inevalence.
[1200.32 - 1202.32] P:1869.15 E:0.102595 |  Back it goes to Courtois.
[1202.32 - 1205.32] P:1918.24 E:0.103138 |  Arsenal looking to try and close down high.
[1205.32 - 1209.32] P:1864.57 E:0.090153 |  Erdogan looking to press now against Ruriga.
[1209.32 - 1211.32] P:1986.14 E:0.106786 |  Back it goes to Courtois.
[1211.32 - 1213.32] P:1983.46 E:0.099216 |  Arsenal capture will run towards Courtois,
[1213.32 - 1215.32] P:1898.38 E:0.089934 |  who clears it long downfield.
[1215.32 - 1218.32] P:1989.42 E:0.097797 |  Kibir, chest of all into the path of Lewis Skellig.
[1218.32 - 1221.32] P:1944.33 E:0.099016 |  Think about the rise of Miles Lewis Skellig
[1221.32 - 1223.32] P:1952.13 E:0.078970 |  in the last 12 months.
[1223.32 - 1225.32] P:1943.44 E:0.069314 |  We watched him wembley, didn't we?
[1225.32 - 1227.32] P:1821.83 E:0.102864 |  Play for England in that time.
[1227.32 - 1229.32] P:1949.52 E:0.114062 |  His forward ball, Rice lays it off.
[1229.32 - 1232.32] P:1950.50 E:0.113159 |  Camervinga was the refounder on the Reno nose.
[1232.32 - 1237.32] P:1865.12 E:0.107056 |  Camervinga now threads it through, cut out by Pate.
[1237.32 - 1239.32] P:1906.81 E:0.112747 |  Erdogan picks it up.
[1239.32 - 1241.32] P:1807.76 E:0.096353 |  Now Wattipal this time.
[1241.32 - 1243.32] P:1868.31 E:0.119086 |  Oh, I thought that one was by Camervinga.
[1243.32 - 1244.32] P:1856.83 E:0.105168 |  Ruriga now brings it away.
[1244.32 - 1246.32] P:1844.20 E:0.120162 |  The referee is letting a lot go there.
[1246.32 - 1248.32] P:1876.91 E:0.102157 |  That did look like a foul.
[1248.32 - 1250.32] P:1903.90 E:0.101775 |  Should have been a free kick to Arsenal.
[1250.32 - 1251.32] P:1862.43 E:0.092163 |  Out towards Rodrigo.
[1251.32 - 1253.32] P:1884.17 E:0.117380 |  Killing it off the right touchline.
[1253.32 - 1254.32] P:1957.90 E:0.080108 |  Into the area.
[1254.32 - 1256.32] P:1882.01 E:0.101446 |  Mbappe, onto his left boot.
[1256.32 - 1257.32] P:1937.28 E:0.090871 |  Hits it now to Vinicius Jr.
[1257.32 - 1258.32] P:1874.96 E:0.090507 |  Inside the penalty area.
[1258.32 - 1260.32] P:1880.57 E:0.112404 |  Goes for the curler, right foot in wide.
[1260.32 - 1262.32] P:1716.07 E:0.105831 |  Arteta complains for the fourth official.
[1262.32 - 1264.32] P:1751.61 E:0.120100 |  I think he's got good reason.
[1264.32 - 1265.32] P:1861.01 E:0.104090 |  I agree.
[1265.32 - 1268.32] P:1913.95 E:0.105003 |  If that had gone in, that would not have been well received
[1268.32 - 1269.32] P:1896.94 E:0.094822 |  around this ground at all.
[1269.32 - 1270.32] P:1885.13 E:0.107301 |  Vinicius Jr.
[1270.32 - 1272.32] P:1947.47 E:0.095280 |  Tries a cheeky little early effort
[1272.32 - 1274.32] P:1873.32 E:0.102150 |  with his right foot this time coming inside,
[1274.32 - 1277.32] P:1847.04 E:0.098814 |  just to try and bend it into the far post.
[1277.32 - 1279.32] P:1884.91 E:0.103242 |  But for me, it looked a foul from Camervinga
[1279.32 - 1281.32] P:1806.42 E:0.099765 |  on that odour guard.
[1281.32 - 1282.32] P:1936.10 E:0.085932 |  He'd got the wrong side of him.
[1282.32 - 1283.32] P:1958.22 E:0.107025 |  He was running alongside him.
[1283.32 - 1286.32] P:1913.72 E:0.094066 |  He clipped his heels or just tricked him in some way.
[1286.32 - 1287.32] P:1791.73 E:0.085703 |  Referee was in a great position.
[1287.32 - 1289.32] P:1854.96 E:0.097151 |  Just didn't fancy it as a foul.
[1289.32 - 1292.32] P:1926.42 E:0.068750 |  But certainly looked like that from here.
[1292.32 - 1295.32] P:1840.18 E:0.088607 |  Saliva back with Timber.
[1295.32 - 1298.32] P:1867.11 E:0.095538 |  Goes square once again then for Saliva,
[1298.32 - 1301.32] P:1800.20 E:0.116230 |  who edges his way towards the centre circle.
[1301.32 - 1304.32] P:1827.73 E:0.106879 |  BBC Radio 5 Live and it's still 0-0.
[1304.32 - 1305.32] P:1808.63 E:0.117265 |  Another goal on London Road.
[1305.32 - 1306.32] P:1866.11 E:0.104090 |  Nathan Albans.
[1306.32 - 1307.32] P:1838.12 E:0.101101 |  Birmingham back in front.
[1307.32 - 1309.32] P:1799.50 E:0.101114 |  Peterborough 1, Birmingham 2.
[1309.32 - 1311.32] P:2097.66 E:0.081528 |  Taylor Gardner-Hickman squeezing it in
[1311.32 - 1313.32] P:1950.04 E:0.092370 |  at the near post under Belokapitch.
[1313.32 - 1315.32] P:1891.08 E:0.096574 |  Peterborough 1, Birmingham 2.
[1315.32 - 1317.32] P:1865.70 E:0.100946 |  That would mean promotion to the championship
[1317.32 - 1319.32] P:1939.26 E:0.098243 |  for Birmingham City as Urda guard towards Saka.
[1319.32 - 1323.32] P:1835.04 E:0.095220 |  Saka into Marino.
[1323.32 - 1326.32] P:1902.80 E:0.098154 |  And there was Asensio who will just cover
[1326.32 - 1328.32] P:1827.55 E:0.095894 |  and clear it down the line to Bellingham.
[1328.32 - 1330.32] P:1839.63 E:0.093180 |  And Bellingham in field to Ruriga
[1330.32 - 1332.32] P:1907.91 E:0.086097 |  on the edge of his own penalty area.
[1332.32 - 1335.32] P:1934.98 E:0.114660 |  But his forward ball and Saliva will let it run out of play
[1335.32 - 1338.32] P:1975.51 E:0.092241 |  before a throw that our tether will actually just toss
[1338.32 - 1340.32] P:1882.70 E:0.088026 |  quickly into the hands of Saliva.
[1340.32 - 1344.32] P:1885.88 E:0.083927 |  And Arsenal take that throw quickly on this near side, the right.
[1344.32 - 1347.32] P:1923.50 E:0.089109 |  But the quality of the two teams,
[1347.32 - 1350.32] P:1841.43 E:0.090207 |  every time they pick it up in and around
[1350.32 - 1353.32] P:1901.72 E:0.089861 |  the opposing penalty area, you think something could happen.
[1353.32 - 1356.32] P:1868.73 E:0.084532 |  Yeah, I mean, it's just fantastic quality that there,
[1356.32 - 1359.32] P:1867.24 E:0.093210 |  how slick Arsenal were from Urda guard into Saka on the move
[1359.32 - 1362.32] P:1840.75 E:0.090046 |  and on the turn as well.
[1362.32 - 1364.32] P:1876.36 E:0.085870 |  So he's kind of took it on the swivel, on his back foot,
[1364.32 - 1367.32] P:1876.01 E:0.084817 |  while he's rotating forwards and then nearly slipping the ball
[1367.32 - 1369.32] P:1562.72 E:0.101618 |  into Marino.
[1369.32 - 1372.32] P:1723.97 E:0.087276 |  You just feel with Arsenal, when it gets in that central area
[1372.32 - 1374.32] P:1817.25 E:0.095583 |  though, it's not quite got that cutting edge.
[1374.32 - 1378.32] P:1842.39 E:0.093757 |  I mean, I know around it has some real quality in terms of finishing,
[1378.32 - 1382.32] P:1865.18 E:0.091520 |  but it's just lacking that real potent feel that Real Madrid have.
[1382.32 - 1384.32] P:1821.25 E:0.107506 |  It's like when we heard from Manuel, the Spanish journalist
[1384.32 - 1386.32] P:1868.06 E:0.107966 |  who joined us before when he was speaking to Kelly,
[1386.32 - 1393.32] P:1841.93 E:0.085968 |  you know how Marino will do in that area as a makeshift striker.
[1393.32 - 1396.32] P:1982.74 E:0.100686 |  Somebody who of course has indeed himself to Spain.
[1396.32 - 1401.32] P:1940.14 E:0.081532 |  I remember the goal that he scored against Germany in Europe.
[1401.32 - 1404.32] P:1886.73 E:0.079199 |  Yes, it was.
[1404.32 - 1406.32] P:1842.24 E:0.105060 |  And you see him do that for Arsenal, don't you?
[1406.32 - 1408.32] P:1857.83 E:0.081756 |  That is a big tick in the box.
[1408.32 - 1410.32] P:1716.14 E:0.102519 |  That wide in the air, I'll back him all the days.
[1410.32 - 1413.32] P:1842.00 E:0.091655 |  It's that little strikery poacher
[1413.32 - 1415.32] P:1802.24 E:0.087163 |  stuffing in and around the box on the floor
[1415.32 - 1419.32] P:1866.66 E:0.088535 |  that, you know, top strikers really do benefit from.
[1419.32 - 1421.32] P:1897.39 E:0.107737 |  Here is Mbappe.
[1421.32 - 1423.32] P:1873.42 E:0.114744 |  Mbappe in the penalty area and he shoots
[1423.32 - 1425.32] P:1894.96 E:0.103472 |  now over the top of the crossbar.
[1425.32 - 1427.32] P:1875.00 E:0.087774 |  Blake Flag wouldn't have counted anyway.
[1427.32 - 1430.32] P:1862.34 E:0.102180 |  Flag is now raised over on that far side,
[1430.32 - 1432.32] P:1824.22 E:0.089989 |  and indeed that goal we're talking about,
[1432.32 - 1434.32] P:1893.62 E:0.093050 |  that was a quarter-final in Stuttgart.
[1434.32 - 1437.32] P:1911.31 E:0.073358 |  It was a big goal, and it was a big head-up.
[1437.32 - 1440.32] P:1886.66 E:0.089359 |  And that there to me looked a big offside.
[1440.32 - 1442.32] P:1787.59 E:0.066684 |  I mean, the flag goes up late.
[1442.32 - 1444.32] P:1777.48 E:0.081892 |  It's a mistake from Arsenal with the ball,
[1444.32 - 1447.32] P:1917.71 E:0.073663 |  but it's comfortably offside from Mbappe,
[1447.32 - 1449.32] P:1908.51 E:0.088681 |  but the assistant kept his flag down,
[1449.32 - 1451.32] P:1931.46 E:0.074518 |  and it's a good thing to go over the crossbar.
[1451.32 - 1454.32] P:1890.17 E:0.091949 |  Timber wasn't to know that, and Timber kept on running.
[1454.32 - 1457.32] P:1858.39 E:0.090449 |  And after the shot, Mbappe collides into Timber,
[1457.32 - 1461.32] P:1850.87 E:0.086823 |  and Timber has actually stayed down inside the penalty area.
[1461.32 - 1465.32] P:1880.14 E:0.093451 |  So there is a stoppage in play, treatment to the Arsenal right back.
[1465.32 - 1469.32] P:1837.04 E:0.090979 |  It remains Arsenal 0, Real Madrid 0, 24 minutes played.
[1469.32 - 1472.32] P:1763.61 E:0.088973 |  What about tonight's other quarter-final, Masferu?
[1472.32 - 1475.32] P:1326.30 E:0.107850 |  Goalists in Munich, Ian, but decent opportunities for both sides.
[1475.32 - 1478.32] P:1170.75 E:0.105596 |  Inter's Hakkan Canahal Nolo with a strike blocked at one end
[1478.32 - 1480.32] P:1425.81 E:0.095860 |  before the Elise Sey, we had a shot deflected.
[1480.32 - 1482.32] P:1247.33 E:0.094793 |  Just wired at the left hand post at the other end.
[1482.32 - 1485.32] P:1468.21 E:0.103547 |  He set up Harry Kane as well with the England captain
[1485.32 - 1487.32] P:1350.37 E:0.110637 |  headed straight at the Interkeeper.
[1487.32 - 1490.32] P:1097.44 E:0.108395 |  We have played 24 minutes in Munich, it is no no.
[1490.32 - 1493.32] P:1838.72 E:0.103894 |  Sheffield Wednesday, got a second goal at Ewood Park in the championship.
[1493.32 - 1496.32] P:1900.86 E:0.096166 |  Blackburn, Neal Sheffield Wednesday 2, Mansfield Town 1,
[1496.32 - 1498.32] P:1856.70 E:0.107933 |  Lake Norrient 1 is the latest scoring League 1.
[1498.32 - 1501.32] P:1897.58 E:0.091229 |  Timber is on his feet, but doesn't know that way he's going to continue.
[1501.32 - 1503.32] P:1771.44 E:0.101433 |  Let's get a look at it from the Riverside Rob Law.
[1503.32 - 1505.32] P:1900.17 E:0.105471 |  And it's still Middlesbrough, Neal leads 1.
[1505.32 - 1508.32] P:1881.73 E:0.103219 |  Borough did have the ball in the back of the net through Tommy Conway,
[1508.32 - 1511.32] P:1910.38 E:0.103237 |  but he was offside still Middlesbrough, Neal leads 1.
[1511.32 - 1513.32] P:1844.63 E:0.092341 |  So, leads third, 82 points.
[1513.32 - 1518.32] P:1891.88 E:0.097765 |  Second place Sheffield United in 83, behind against Millwall by a goal to Neal.
[1518.32 - 1523.32] P:1909.93 E:0.089154 |  Burnley top 84, this is before today, still drawing Neal Nill at Derby.
[1523.32 - 1527.32] P:1896.69 E:0.083457 |  This is frustrating me looking at Timber, it really is because
[1527.32 - 1530.32] P:1833.76 E:0.078807 |  it just didn't need to be in that situation.
[1530.32 - 1533.32] P:1875.35 E:0.093165 |  To me, that was an obvious offside.
[1533.32 - 1537.32] P:1888.49 E:0.084577 |  Get your flag up and then players don't sprint and hurtle towards the ball
[1537.32 - 1539.32] P:1779.72 E:0.091062 |  and put challenges in like that one, they don't need to.
[1539.32 - 1543.32] P:1905.12 E:0.075163 |  It's so frustrating to now see him, I think he's struggling.
[1543.32 - 1547.32] P:1834.12 E:0.100839 |  Well, he's not running freely as he comes down the touch line,
[1547.32 - 1549.32] P:1796.20 E:0.087809 |  he's still not back on the field of play.
[1549.32 - 1553.32] P:1867.83 E:0.089384 |  Fourth official is telling him he's got to wait because of the treatment that he's had.
[1553.32 - 1556.32] P:1830.69 E:0.105247 |  So temporarily Arsenal are down to 10.
[1556.32 - 1562.32] P:1925.25 E:0.094348 |  Lewis Scali pops up right side of the centre circle,
[1562.32 - 1565.32] P:1905.17 E:0.094297 |  the Arsenal left back and then makes a diagonal run
[1565.32 - 1567.32] P:1862.27 E:0.083365 |  and Timber now is back on the field of play.
[1567.32 - 1571.32] P:1950.74 E:0.102363 |  As Arsenal get it out towards Saka this near right hand side, still goalless.
[1571.32 - 1574.32] P:1916.28 E:0.073509 |  Saka waits, goes on the outside, then on the inside
[1574.32 - 1578.32] P:1916.60 E:0.082947 |  and his cross comes off the knee of Canovinga and he's picked up by Courtois.
[1578.32 - 1581.32] P:1883.02 E:0.102096 |  I think Alibar does quite well with his distance there.
[1581.32 - 1584.32] P:1936.90 E:0.075962 |  He's measured that quite nicely so far against Saka,
[1584.32 - 1587.32] P:1953.69 E:0.080899 |  he's close enough but not getting too close
[1587.32 - 1590.32] P:1890.29 E:0.100535 |  and he looks like he can match his movement quite well.
[1590.32 - 1594.32] P:1888.06 E:0.079420 |  And Bapé picks the ball up in the centre circle, out towards Rodrigo,
[1594.32 - 1598.32] P:1939.12 E:0.107978 |  drives forward with Saliva and then they lose the ball.
[1598.32 - 1602.32] P:1866.80 E:0.086996 |  That was Rodrigo winning it back for Real Madrid over on that far side.
[1602.32 - 1606.32] P:1836.01 E:0.097930 |  Here is Mbappe, Mbappe to the edge of the area,
[1606.32 - 1609.32] P:1871.79 E:0.098664 |  Pate's having an effective game for Arsenal in the midfield,
[1609.32 - 1612.32] P:1935.80 E:0.091786 |  he helps snuff him out then, loose ball goes back towards Modrich,
[1612.32 - 1615.32] P:1845.92 E:0.091814 |  Modrich along the ground and Bapé lays it off,
[1615.32 - 1618.32] P:1868.52 E:0.107822 |  out towards Rodrigo, far side the right, still 0-0 here on five-live.
[1618.32 - 1622.32] P:1789.08 E:0.108487 |  30 yards out from goal, Real Madrid seeing a lot of the ball at this stage.
[1622.32 - 1625.32] P:1813.64 E:0.103698 |  Peligam gets the touch, Canovinga,
[1625.32 - 1629.32] P:1780.05 E:0.098635 |  in fact every outfield player now is in the Arsenal half away towards our left.
[1629.32 - 1636.32] P:1871.77 E:0.087819 |  And here is Venetius Jr, they slow it down, Alibar left back towards Rudiger.
[1636.32 - 1641.32] P:1949.08 E:0.092200 |  The Urda Guard runs towards him, he switches it out towards Valverde on the right,
[1641.32 - 1643.32] P:1806.96 E:0.094163 |  his diagonal ball in field.
[1643.32 - 1646.32] P:1877.19 E:0.084061 |  Rodrigo will get a touch and Modrich,
[1646.32 - 1649.32] P:1981.48 E:0.096286 |  this is where he wants to walk as straight things,
[1649.32 - 1651.32] P:1903.59 E:0.098010 |  does Luca Modrich, the 39-year-old,
[1651.32 - 1656.32] P:1898.74 E:0.092731 |  captains an incredible 186 times by Croatia.
[1656.32 - 1660.32] P:1889.37 E:0.087482 |  Ben White in Kittirnia warming up, the ball is played forward
[1660.32 - 1662.32] P:1917.38 E:0.095059 |  and Saliba nicks it away from Bellingham,
[1662.32 - 1665.32] P:1878.18 E:0.104373 |  Timber running a little bit more clean, now finds Urda Guard,
[1665.32 - 1668.32] P:1854.98 E:0.094392 |  Saka's just ahead of him, Canovinga though with the interception,
[1668.32 - 1670.32] P:1884.40 E:0.106817 |  Real Madrid are back in possession.
[1670.32 - 1672.32] P:1786.34 E:0.108622 |  Yeah, it weren't quite quick enough releasing the ball there, Urda Guard,
[1672.32 - 1675.32] P:1929.52 E:0.082447 |  Saka made the move inside, Canovinga read it really well,
[1675.32 - 1679.32] P:1932.43 E:0.092788 |  but I have to say Arsenal did a nice job of being very solid through the midfield,
[1679.32 - 1685.32] P:1893.10 E:0.092953 |  they're pressing well as a group, and then Thomas Parties just screening the centre-backs really well.
[1687.32 - 1690.32] P:1842.52 E:0.117725 |  Ball was played by Valverde at right back, looking for the run of Mbappe,
[1690.32 - 1696.32] P:1876.31 E:0.080639 |  Raya Regain was alert to it, Rice knocks it now to Lewis Scali,
[1696.32 - 1700.32] P:1919.41 E:0.093042 |  Partie left with a centre-circle and now to Timber on this near side,
[1700.32 - 1704.32] P:1854.09 E:0.082113 |  inside the Real Madrid half, and he goes back from Bellingham,
[1704.32 - 1710.32] P:1936.11 E:0.085726 |  Saliba, his forward ball, Marina comes short just outside the centre-circle,
[1710.32 - 1716.32] P:1956.80 E:0.091474 |  holds on to the ball and does well, and then Partie strokes it out towards Saka on this near side,
[1716.32 - 1720.32] P:1874.77 E:0.083060 |  the right, he's encouraged by the supporters around us, there was a couple of go-on,
[1720.32 - 1722.32] P:1843.64 E:0.089567 |  but he didn't, he didn't go on the outside of him,
[1722.32 - 1725.32] P:1893.53 E:0.095278 |  but he gets the ball back now, and he's level with the penalty area,
[1725.32 - 1728.32] P:1899.77 E:0.102180 |  and to Urda Guard, nice roll away from Canovinga,
[1728.32 - 1732.32] P:1911.33 E:0.112509 |  but Canovinga just got a foot into the challenge, back to Bayern Inter, Maseruci.
[1732.32 - 1736.32] P:1737.63 E:0.104775 |  Raya Regain has hit the right post, Bayern so close to the opening goal,
[1736.32 - 1741.32] P:1645.28 E:0.107502 |  Alisa doing wonderfully once again in the build-up, but it is still Bayern Inter now.
[1741.32 - 1746.32] P:1846.44 E:0.100152 |  Tesserers just told the crowd, just keep going, want them to keep up the atmosphere as well,
[1746.32 - 1752.32] P:1922.22 E:0.086404 |  they're going to need the supporters tonight here at Arsenal, this is a test against the European champions,
[1752.32 - 1755.32] P:1889.16 E:0.087143 |  regardless what Optus Supercomputer might tell you.
[1755.32 - 1760.32] P:1809.27 E:0.081850 |  The Deno Supercomputer, which I was more important than the Optus one, it's more knowledgeable.
[1760.32 - 1764.32] P:1911.59 E:0.093470 |  I'm not going to talk about that, here is Kibir, this is Saliba.
[1764.32 - 1768.32] P:1878.70 E:0.092412 |  Canovinga's had a good game so far, and the question that was raised,
[1768.32 - 1772.32] P:1881.76 E:0.082587 |  certainly with Manuel before and Andros about, you know,
[1772.32 - 1774.32] P:1831.30 E:0.115023 |  Modric's ability to physically get around the pitch,
[1774.32 - 1780.32] P:1961.40 E:0.107867 |  well, Canovinga is doing the work of two men at times,
[1780.32 - 1785.32] P:1940.57 E:0.103704 |  he really is stopping and breaking up a lot of play, it's very hard to get past 1B1,
[1785.32 - 1788.32] P:1835.85 E:0.078973 |  I think Urda Guard's finding that really difficult.
[1788.32 - 1791.32] P:1915.26 E:0.106335 |  He's filled in at Lefak on a few occasions this season too,
[1791.32 - 1797.32] P:1925.37 E:0.093679 |  at the French international now in his fourth season at Real Madrid, showing his versatility.
[1797.32 - 1802.32] P:1944.02 E:0.098340 |  But as we approach the half hour on BBC Radio 5 Live, it remains 0-0,
[1802.32 - 1805.32] P:1942.18 E:0.094623 |  and Declan Rice unable to keep the ball in play.
[1805.32 - 1809.32] P:1889.78 E:0.097373 |  You know there's a fascinating back story between Saliba and Mbappe,
[1809.32 - 1815.32] P:1876.67 E:0.079941 |  they were both raised in the same suburb in north-eastern Paris,
[1815.32 - 1820.32] P:1851.93 E:0.093028 |  and Mbappe's father Wilfred actually coached Saliba for a time.
[1820.32 - 1823.32] P:1887.69 E:0.103934 |  So when they're coming up against each other head to head,
[1823.32 - 1826.32] P:1864.34 E:0.090342 |  they actually played back in the playground.
[1826.32 - 1830.32] P:1878.44 E:0.094404 |  They were kicked around with each other, put the jumpers down,
[1830.32 - 1833.32] P:1817.97 E:0.088820 |  did Rush goalkeeper, never done dazed dinner.
[1833.32 - 1838.32] P:1851.86 E:0.093338 |  Yeah, I wouldn't have minded Mbappe being my Rush goalkeeper.
[1838.32 - 1844.32] P:1889.64 E:0.078010 |  Here is Alaba, to Vinicius just inside the Real Madrid half.
[1844.32 - 1846.32] P:1911.20 E:0.118922 |  This pass goes to Mbappe, goes astray.
[1846.32 - 1849.32] P:1841.58 E:0.096618 |  Saliba was there or thereabouts just to break it up.
[1849.32 - 1852.32] P:1855.47 E:0.099706 |  Timbert loses out to Bellingham, snaps away at the heels of Bellingham,
[1852.32 - 1855.32] P:1831.04 E:0.100606 |  but he wriggles free, and now he looks for that ball in round the back.
[1855.32 - 1857.32] P:1856.31 E:0.107995 |  And here is Mbappe, Mbappe's in the penalty area,
[1857.32 - 1861.32] P:1904.37 E:0.110583 |  Ryder makes the save, brilliant goalkeeping by David Ryder,
[1861.32 - 1864.32] P:1901.31 E:0.113470 |  and the Arsenal supporters in front of his rise to their feet,
[1864.32 - 1866.32] P:1915.53 E:0.104437 |  and now he throws it out towards Rice.
[1866.32 - 1868.32] P:1974.25 E:0.100937 |  These two sides still slugging it out,
[1868.32 - 1872.32] P:1956.82 E:0.103493 |  Martin Ellingham runs forward at pace, far side to left, still goalless.
[1872.32 - 1875.32] P:1952.06 E:0.110601 |  Level the penalty area, inches his way towards the area,
[1875.32 - 1877.32] P:1927.52 E:0.112299 |  goes on the outside of Belverde, with the cross,
[1877.32 - 1880.32] P:1884.34 E:0.098776 |  running ahead of the ball up, Courtois catches it.
[1880.32 - 1885.32] P:1883.61 E:0.105615 |  Wow, two really good pieces of attacking play from either team.
[1885.32 - 1888.32] P:1913.86 E:0.101798 |  It's like you have a pop at us and we'll have a pop at you.
[1888.32 - 1890.32] P:1944.31 E:0.093694 |  And the Arsenal for the first time just got exposed there,
[1890.32 - 1892.32] P:1932.81 E:0.094166 |  Bellingham with a lovely pass,
[1892.32 - 1894.32] P:1774.63 E:0.107558 |  but the run from Mbappe was unbelievable,
[1894.32 - 1897.32] P:1947.81 E:0.098735 |  the time in and the speed of it.
[1897.32 - 1900.32] P:1885.44 E:0.098773 |  Desperately fending by Timbert, comes to Mbappe,
[1900.32 - 1904.32] P:1890.39 E:0.093896 |  shown on the inside, right footed, passes the ball short.
[1904.32 - 1908.32] P:1901.53 E:0.097742 |  Rodrigo in the penalty area, his cross takes an infection.
[1908.32 - 1912.32] P:1917.12 E:0.106350 |  No word of a lie, you cannot take your eye on this game for a moment.
[1912.32 - 1916.32] P:1837.79 E:0.089667 |  No, it's very open at the moment, and I think it will be like that.
[1916.32 - 1919.32] P:1836.34 E:0.096213 |  It kind of has lulls, doesn't it, where, OK, we'll keep it possession,
[1919.32 - 1922.32] P:1875.04 E:0.099189 |  it'll go slow, it'll go slow, and then bang's quick.
[1922.32 - 1926.32] P:1869.52 E:0.093746 |  And certainly with Real Madrid, with the way they play,
[1926.32 - 1929.32] P:1863.35 E:0.089780 |  the runs that Mbappe makes, he got him behind that one time,
[1929.32 - 1932.32] P:1893.98 E:0.100608 |  Kivio struggled to stay with him, really good save from Rea,
[1932.32 - 1935.32] P:1896.66 E:0.091646 |  but what I loved about Arsenal's reaction was he picked the ball up,
[1935.32 - 1939.32] P:1829.19 E:0.095311 |  got his head up Rea and thought, right, how can we hurt Real Madrid quickly?
[1939.32 - 1942.32] P:1858.23 E:0.094515 |  Because they're high up the pitch, pings it out to Marta and Ellie,
[1942.32 - 1945.32] P:1931.98 E:0.095412 |  then he's having a go, and I think that just stretches the game
[1945.32 - 1947.32] P:1888.61 E:0.089222 |  and really makes it much more entertaining.
[1947.32 - 1951.32] P:1925.14 E:0.098364 |  Interesting there is Real Madrid have got this corner kick on the right-hand side,
[1951.32 - 1954.32] P:1925.42 E:0.088433 |  Erdogan was desperate to get the attention of the set-piece coach of Arsenal,
[1954.32 - 1957.32] P:1887.47 E:0.095808 |  Nicholas Jova, just to see who he should be picking up.
[1957.32 - 1960.32] P:1867.67 E:0.096787 |  He's gone with Rodrigo, in comes the corner,
[1960.32 - 1965.32] P:1913.09 E:0.100205 |  it's a disappointing one from that far side, it was volleyed away by Saka,
[1965.32 - 1970.32] P:1836.89 E:0.088734 |  and Viquel Arteza still in the animated way of his patrols,
[1970.32 - 1975.32] P:1813.41 E:0.090183 |  that technical area with his black shoes, his black trousers,
[1975.32 - 1978.32] P:1815.36 E:0.084820 |  his black jacket matching that of his hair,
[1979.32 - 1983.32] P:1940.32 E:0.104901 |  as we have 13 minutes to go to half-time.
[1983.32 - 1986.32] P:1885.35 E:0.099564 |  Meanwhile, Carlo Ancelotti,
[1988.32 - 1990.32] P:1927.47 E:0.102359 |  not pacing as much,
[1990.32 - 1996.32] P:1878.44 E:0.071964 |  but he is chewing that gum ferociously as ever as Pate,
[1996.32 - 1999.32] P:1856.74 E:0.105461 |  loses out to Bellingham, the two number fives, Bellingham goes square,
[1999.32 - 2002.32] P:1851.01 E:0.098150 |  and Bapé drives forward out towards Venetius Junior,
[2002.32 - 2006.32] P:1976.87 E:0.101394 |  penalty area left-hand side, Venetius Junior with a cross,
[2006.32 - 2009.32] P:1795.03 E:0.109301 |  headed away by Saliba, and Bapé there wins the ball back,
[2009.32 - 2011.32] P:1799.28 E:0.108190 |  takes it away from Erdogan, drops his shoulder,
[2011.32 - 2016.32] P:1850.76 E:0.100561 |  but then dispossessed by Marino, and there was a foul there by Bapé.
[2016.32 - 2019.32] P:1930.77 E:0.107779 |  Ooh, now did him just kick out?
[2019.32 - 2021.32] P:1824.82 E:0.096770 |  Or did he look to go and kick out?
[2021.32 - 2024.32] P:1832.57 E:0.092766 |  Yeah, it looked like he threatened it, and then it actually didn't follow through.
[2024.32 - 2028.32] P:1924.15 E:0.093233 |  Marino was in it laying on the floor, it's out of frustration,
[2028.32 - 2030.32] P:1813.93 E:0.092987 |  he really does look up for it, I have to say, Bapé,
[2030.32 - 2032.32] P:1829.15 E:0.101874 |  he's all over this game at the moment.
[2032.32 - 2034.32] P:1728.00 E:0.081088 |  Yeah, it was just a bit of frustration,
[2034.32 - 2036.32] P:1842.85 E:0.109459 |  the referee's just had a word in his ear.
[2036.32 - 2038.32] P:1856.33 E:0.102341 |  Bramble Lane, Sheffield United-Millwall, Tom Gale.
[2038.32 - 2041.32] P:1822.03 E:0.109849 |  Half-time, Sheffield United-Nil, Millwall won,
[2041.32 - 2044.32] P:1907.29 E:0.093095 |  as it stands, host dropping out of the automatic places,
[2044.32 - 2047.32] P:1934.28 E:0.101971 |  Coburn thumping home, Millwall's only effort on target.
[2047.32 - 2050.32] P:1950.37 E:0.105513 |  Half-time, Sheffield United-Millwall won.
[2050.32 - 2054.32] P:1878.08 E:0.103415 |  Here is Erdogan, Erdogan out towards Saka on this near side, the right.
[2054.32 - 2057.32] P:1906.44 E:0.093503 |  They've doubled up on Saka, infield towards Erdogan.
[2057.32 - 2060.32] P:1889.82 E:0.090876 |  Erdogan looked to try and deliver the cross, left footed,
[2060.32 - 2062.32] P:1892.56 E:0.086051 |  can't, passes the ball back towards Saka.
[2062.32 - 2065.32] P:1968.13 E:0.092756 |  Can Saka deliver the ball? No, he plays it short,
[2065.32 - 2068.32] P:1865.13 E:0.093506 |  then back towards Saka, the two still combining.
[2068.32 - 2072.32] P:1885.38 E:0.099171 |  Saka under pressure, Pate, 30 yards out from goal,
[2072.32 - 2075.32] P:1910.05 E:0.114359 |  retain possession, they had to go away from the penalty area though.
[2075.32 - 2077.32] P:1882.27 E:0.094543 |  Timber midway through the Real Madrid half,
[2077.32 - 2080.32] P:1932.54 E:0.093244 |  triangle of passing patterns from Arsenal.
[2080.32 - 2083.32] P:1871.02 E:0.102739 |  Now Arsenal have every outfield player in the Real Madrid half,
[2083.32 - 2085.32] P:1817.88 E:0.111166 |  and we've got just over 10 minutes to go to the break,
[2085.32 - 2088.32] P:1897.12 E:0.095249 |  as Martinelli tries to come forward.
[2088.32 - 2090.32] P:1990.15 E:0.101910 |  Half-time at Derby, Lee Blakeman.
[2090.32 - 2092.32] P:1982.71 E:0.101654 |  Derby-Nil, Burnley-Nil, Derby ending the half strongest,
[2092.32 - 2094.32] P:1799.11 E:0.095190 |  but Burnley with the game's best chance,
[2094.32 - 2097.32] P:1813.17 E:0.095066 |  Fleming 12 yards out, great take, powerful shot,
[2097.32 - 2101.32] P:1769.43 E:0.088564 |  brilliant save, Zetterstrom to keep it at Derby-Nil, Burnley-Nil.
[2101.32 - 2104.32] P:1839.57 E:0.104371 |  And with Leeds United, which is an eight o'clock kickoff at Middlesbrough,
[2104.32 - 2107.32] P:1881.88 E:0.100708 |  leading by a goal to know it means that Leeds United will go top
[2107.32 - 2109.32] P:1867.79 E:0.088247 |  on goal difference over Burnley.
[2109.32 - 2114.32] P:1892.11 E:0.085020 |  They'll both be two points clear of Sheffield United as it currently stands.
[2114.32 - 2119.32] P:1883.57 E:0.087655 |  Here is Detlin Rice on that far side, he tries to deliver the cross,
[2119.32 - 2122.32] P:1825.48 E:0.092560 |  kept him play, Martinelli now has it down by the corner flag,
[2122.32 - 2127.32] P:1953.99 E:0.092193 |  still they beaver away, but Rodrigo dispossesses him,
[2127.32 - 2130.32] P:1906.76 E:0.100280 |  Rodrigo with a little nonchalant flick to his right and Valverde,
[2130.32 - 2134.32] P:1927.24 E:0.093359 |  hoisted away downfield, nice touch there by Vinicius Jr.
[2134.32 - 2136.32] P:1889.08 E:0.125996 |  He uses his strength to hold off Timber.
[2136.32 - 2138.32] P:1861.00 E:0.119914 |  Ooh, a game.
[2138.32 - 2140.32] P:1759.14 E:0.115310 |  I didn't think that Timber did much wrong there.
[2140.32 - 2144.32] P:1796.91 E:0.108021 |  Vinicius Jr. quick to go to ground and he gets a free kick, fortunate.
[2144.32 - 2148.32] P:1769.46 E:0.093519 |  Yeah, I think the referee is not endearing himself
[2148.32 - 2151.32] P:1764.05 E:0.097238 |  to the Emirates faithful as a couple of decisions he's made,
[2151.32 - 2153.32] P:1724.63 E:0.092931 |  haven't gone Arsenal's way.
[2153.32 - 2156.32] P:1823.94 E:0.093540 |  The foul on Ode to Kamovinka, that for me was a definite one,
[2156.32 - 2158.32] P:1803.06 E:0.094591 |  and that there, he barely touches in there Timber.
[2158.32 - 2161.32] P:1924.16 E:0.090570 |  He gets nice and tight, he bumps him, he does all the things that you think,
[2161.32 - 2165.32] P:1855.24 E:0.090818 |  the contact that's acceptable in the game, and then Vinicius falls to the floor,
[2165.32 - 2168.32] P:1870.98 E:0.088296 |  bang, the whistle gets blown in, wins a free kick,
[2168.32 - 2171.32] P:1875.83 E:0.088998 |  but what a pass from Valverde and the touch from Vinicius to make that happen,
[2171.32 - 2173.32] P:1856.74 E:0.082158 |  it was lovely, wasn't it?
[2173.32 - 2175.32] P:1995.83 E:0.105963 |  The other half-time scores in the championship,
[2175.32 - 2178.32] P:1868.58 E:0.106450 |  no goals at Bristol City against West Brom, Norwich Sundland,
[2178.32 - 2182.32] P:1826.94 E:0.111202 |  Stoke against Luton, Watford Holt or Derby Burnley as we know,
[2182.32 - 2184.32] P:1830.71 E:0.099151 |  Blackburn Nilscheffel Wednesday 2, Preston Leed Cardiff by a goal to Nilscheffel Wednesday 2,
[2184.32 - 2186.32] P:1832.87 E:0.103953 |  Preston Leed Cardiff by a goal to Nilscheffel Wednesday 2,
[2186.32 - 2187.32] P:1805.64 E:0.075067 |  Preston Leed Cardiff by a goal to Nilscheffel Wednesday 2,
[2187.32 - 2191.32] P:1832.31 E:0.080256 |  and that gives you the half-time picture in the championship.
[2191.32 - 2196.32] P:1777.98 E:0.088762 |  Real Madrid on that far side the right, we've got nine minutes to go to half-time,
[2196.32 - 2201.32] P:1888.86 E:0.090622 |  been a captivating game, really has, 36 minutes played there,
[2201.32 - 2204.32] P:1838.88 E:0.094834 |  Moderic gets the ball back, lifts his right arm a lot,
[2204.32 - 2207.32] P:1714.68 E:0.090184 |  the Real Madrid captain inside the centre-circle,
[2207.32 - 2210.32] P:1824.84 E:0.106509 |  and at the minute they're playing in front of Arsenal as Kamovinka
[2211.32 - 2215.32] P:1856.34 E:0.090094 |  almost dispossessed by Marino, Rudiger,
[2215.32 - 2218.32] P:1914.35 E:0.109864 |  sprays the ball out towards that far side,
[2218.32 - 2220.32] P:1849.32 E:0.094274 |  been excellently defending by Lewis Skelly,
[2220.32 - 2224.32] P:1869.90 E:0.099938 |  Pate links up with Martinelli, Martinelli to Marino,
[2224.32 - 2226.32] P:1864.98 E:0.123541 |  passes the ball out now to Declan Rice,
[2226.32 - 2229.32] P:1859.61 E:0.103541 |  Arsenal working it nicely down the pitch,
[2229.32 - 2231.32] P:1944.91 E:0.114953 |  Martinelli had made a run in behind Valverde,
[2231.32 - 2235.32] P:1883.95 E:0.104656 |  but Rice opts to play the ball out to this near side, the right,
[2235.32 - 2238.32] P:1889.49 E:0.111652 |  and now Erdogan runs forward, Sackers on the touch-line,
[2238.32 - 2240.32] P:1818.35 E:0.094831 |  the left-levelled with the penalty area,
[2240.32 - 2242.32] P:1823.50 E:0.091360 |  Rice had made a run into the penalty area,
[2242.32 - 2245.32] P:1918.19 E:0.115405 |  Sackers holds on to the ball, Sackers plays it in the row,
[2245.32 - 2250.32] P:1860.68 E:0.108712 |  nobody got the touch, nobody gambled, Valverde should clear,
[2252.32 - 2254.32] P:1836.80 E:0.114508 |  that was such a wicked ball in.
[2255.32 - 2259.32] P:1802.03 E:0.115893 |  Yes, the moment isn't it, that is the moment for Arsenal in this first half,
[2259.32 - 2262.32] P:1917.78 E:0.108625 |  the tap one in at the back post at this stage
[2262.32 - 2265.32] P:1860.60 E:0.096967 |  would have been absolutely magnificent for the home crowd,
[2265.32 - 2269.32] P:1866.35 E:0.108958 |  I mean, Sackers, the first time in this game really does get the better of his opponent,
[2269.32 - 2272.32] P:1770.44 E:0.110718 |  I think it was Bellingham, it ended up with him 1v1,
[2272.32 - 2275.32] P:1742.43 E:0.104750 |  goes on the outside with his right foot and fizzes it,
[2275.32 - 2278.32] P:1798.46 E:0.090694 |  all the way across the face of the goal,
[2278.32 - 2283.32] P:1867.68 E:0.086789 |  that is where you centre-forward, who picks up an instinctive position, scores,
[2283.32 - 2286.32] P:1806.88 E:0.095605 |  that is the moment where a centre-forward in that position
[2286.32 - 2290.32] P:1893.52 E:0.092597 |  will know that back post area and they'll just tap that in at the back post.
[2290.32 - 2293.32] P:1915.78 E:0.096294 |  Martinelli, left-hand side, tries to get away from Valverde,
[2293.32 - 2295.32] P:1906.15 E:0.110059 |  he snaps into the challenge and wins the ball,
[2295.32 - 2300.32] P:1942.12 E:0.093682 |  Rodrigo picks it up but he's still deep inside his own half, back towards Modric,
[2300.32 - 2302.32] P:1837.03 E:0.097321 |  when you say that is the moment Matt,
[2302.32 - 2305.32] P:1879.97 E:0.095884 |  when you're at this stage of the competition, we're talking fine margins.
[2305.32 - 2310.32] P:1921.07 E:0.093303 |  Absolutely, it's those moments that define your future in the competition.
[2311.32 - 2314.32] P:1822.45 E:0.101083 |  0-0 here, but there has been a goal in Munich, Masferuki.
[2314.32 - 2317.32] P:1803.30 E:0.102333 |  Well how about this, against the run of Clavine,
[2317.32 - 2320.32] P:1703.23 E:0.105307 |  they've had the better chances but they trail into a head,
[2320.32 - 2325.32] P:1727.06 E:0.103980 |  La Tero Martinez powering the Serie A side in front, by a nil into one.
[2325.32 - 2330.32] P:1825.93 E:0.088646 |  They've only conceded two goals throughout the Champions League campaign,
[2330.32 - 2333.32] P:1748.42 E:0.082567 |  that is by far the most impressive,
[2333.32 - 2338.32] P:1847.22 E:0.095236 |  Arsenal have only conceded six but Inter arcs a serious, serious side
[2338.32 - 2341.32] P:1774.76 E:0.103471 |  and the winners of that will play the winners of Barcelona, Borussia Dortmund,
[2341.32 - 2343.32] P:1867.70 E:0.104070 |  Peter Burmingham in League One, Nathan Elvin.
[2343.32 - 2345.32] P:1805.99 E:0.086533 |  Burmingham on course for promotion tonight,
[2345.32 - 2349.32] P:1994.05 E:0.098579 |  two-one they lead here at Peter Burr, Alphimea and Gardner Hickman,
[2349.32 - 2353.32] P:1842.59 E:0.098169 |  either side of a Pocco level, Champagne on ice, half-time, Peter Burr won,
[2353.32 - 2354.32] P:1813.67 E:0.092447 |  Burmingham two.
[2354.32 - 2358.32] P:1772.29 E:0.092750 |  Bellingham out to Alvar on this near side,
[2358.32 - 2364.32] P:1838.23 E:0.080588 |  Vinicius Tune goes to Rodrigo and Real Madrid again,
[2364.32 - 2366.32] P:1842.59 E:0.083248 |  pass the ball into the centre circle.
[2366.32 - 2368.32] P:1822.07 E:0.103520 |  The other important game in League One involves Wickham, there are Huddersfield,
[2368.32 - 2369.32] P:1858.27 E:0.089956 |  Nikesh Ragani.
[2370.32 - 2373.32] P:1794.91 E:0.109940 |  Whereas Huddersfield nil, Wickham nil, two sides pushing for promotion,
[2373.32 - 2375.32] P:1870.54 E:0.095732 |  both had a couple of decent chances early on,
[2375.32 - 2378.32] P:1828.77 E:0.106214 |  Ben Wilds missing an absolute sitter for the home side
[2378.32 - 2380.32] P:1709.02 E:0.099383 |  but there's been a real lack of quality so far,
[2380.32 - 2382.32] P:1809.41 E:0.091575 |  it's Huddersfield nil, Wickham nil.
[2382.32 - 2385.32] P:1814.28 E:0.099259 |  And in fact, it's Wickham's game in hand on Wrexham
[2385.32 - 2390.32] P:1902.73 E:0.104782 |  who they trailed six points ahead of the game in West Yorkshire.
[2390.32 - 2394.32] P:1902.20 E:0.100915 |  Nil Nill remains here in the Champions League quarter-final, first leg,
[2394.32 - 2397.32] P:1855.72 E:0.094100 |  Courtois clears long, Bellingham is underneath it,
[2397.32 - 2402.32] P:1899.16 E:0.108624 |  Timber though beats him in the air, that bouncing ball laid off by a leaping
[2402.32 - 2407.32] P:1863.37 E:0.111870 |  right to Pate, now Sacher on the right side, over the half-way line,
[2407.32 - 2410.32] P:1839.99 E:0.099362 |  Alaba backpedals, he's wanting some support here,
[2410.32 - 2413.32] P:1913.77 E:0.104722 |  he's actually asking Camarvinha to come and double up on Sacher,
[2413.32 - 2417.32] P:1870.61 E:0.114380 |  they now work the ball behind Alaba, Sacher is there and he's called it behind
[2417.32 - 2420.32] P:1754.88 E:0.116034 |  Martinelli who was making a run in the far post,
[2421.32 - 2425.32] P:1842.32 E:0.112903 |  not for the first time, Arsenal will be known the lack of a natural centre forward.
[2425.32 - 2428.32] P:1821.15 E:0.101550 |  Well it's just great play, great understanding,
[2428.32 - 2431.32] P:1727.18 E:0.115696 |  I thought Sacher was going to go it alone but he lends the ball
[2431.32 - 2434.32] P:1781.19 E:0.095326 |  inside the pitch to OdaGuard, looks disinterested,
[2434.32 - 2437.32] P:1797.82 E:0.106670 |  then makes a darting little run in behind Alaba,
[2437.32 - 2441.32] P:1849.17 E:0.094924 |  typical Martin OdaGuard feeds the ball perfect way of passing,
[2441.32 - 2446.32] P:1846.08 E:0.091661 |  just nobody on the end of it coming in at the back post, Martinelli just too far ahead of the ball.
[2446.32 - 2449.32] P:1810.38 E:0.091930 |  Here is Timber, edge of the area, just loses it,
[2449.32 - 2454.32] P:1818.20 E:0.113137 |  Camarvinha passes the ball forward, Kibir was quickly into the challenge
[2454.32 - 2457.32] P:1847.08 E:0.107333 |  against Mbappe who went to ground,
[2457.32 - 2463.32] P:1894.90 E:0.101485 |  Boston referee who's yet to show a yellow card will just call the Polish defender towards him,
[2463.32 - 2466.32] P:1768.46 E:0.098546 |  maybe a little bit too tight on Mbappe,
[2466.32 - 2471.32] P:1804.12 E:0.083109 |  but with four minutes to go and a half time, get the ball to Sacher.
[2472.32 - 2477.32] P:1731.01 E:0.089729 |  I don't think he touches Mbappe, I think Kibir just goes in tight,
[2477.32 - 2480.32] P:1845.43 E:0.079767 |  I've just had a look at the slow motion replay, doesn't touch him,
[2480.32 - 2485.32] P:1831.22 E:0.084017 |  and I mean, yeah, nothing in it at all,
[2485.32 - 2487.32] P:1763.87 E:0.089841 |  it's been a bit hard done by with the decisions Arsenal,
[2487.32 - 2489.32] P:1767.75 E:0.094029 |  he's right on top of that as well, the referee.
[2489.32 - 2494.32] P:1859.25 E:0.086012 |  Yes, here is Rodrigo running back inside his own half and accelerating,
[2494.32 - 2497.32] P:1850.62 E:0.118623 |  when he passes the ball left, put it over the top, looking for the run of Mbappe,
[2497.32 - 2499.32] P:1834.21 E:0.107155 |  but Mbappe wasn't chasing that.
[2499.32 - 2501.32] P:1788.19 E:0.099614 |  You don't know the referee at all do you?
[2501.32 - 2502.32] P:1846.26 E:0.084742 |  No, I don't know.
[2502.32 - 2506.32] P:1815.67 E:0.088148 |  I don't know how you like to branch out sometimes and get to know the official.
[2506.32 - 2509.32] P:1861.08 E:0.086450 |  Haven't branched out to Bosnia just yet.
[2511.32 - 2514.32] P:1784.71 E:0.109463 |  Here is Arsenal in possession with the risk, there is time.
[2516.32 - 2518.32] P:1800.41 E:0.114583 |  We've got three and a half minutes to go and a half time.
[2519.32 - 2524.32] P:1717.48 E:0.105107 |  Here is Timber, is the one last chance for Sacher to test Alibar.
[2525.32 - 2530.32] P:1786.80 E:0.090587 |  As Arsenal go back, Saliba right to the centre circle,
[2530.32 - 2536.32] P:1817.55 E:0.091245 |  Erdogan now has Bellingham close by, Erdogan back towards Timber.
[2537.32 - 2540.32] P:1795.50 E:0.101499 |  You can certainly see the respect though that Real Madrid have for Arsenal.
[2540.32 - 2544.32] P:1867.51 E:0.104152 |  I think Arsenal, edging his first half, you know, Madrid have had a couple of moments,
[2545.32 - 2548.32] P:1768.66 E:0.101986 |  but Arsenal on the whole have been really impressive,
[2548.32 - 2550.32] P:1913.07 E:0.103756 |  really good first half showing so far.
[2551.32 - 2553.32] P:1830.80 E:0.103460 |  First time we can hear Spanish voices.
[2553.32 - 2557.32] P:1817.17 E:0.102835 |  As Real Madrid will try and break with Vanessa's junior,
[2557.32 - 2560.32] P:1787.99 E:0.117544 |  Cartier again though, his game management, his awareness.
[2561.32 - 2566.32] P:1839.36 E:0.110849 |  He has been very effective in that midfield, he sensed the danger.
[2566.32 - 2569.32] P:1860.55 E:0.090709 |  Yeah, two or three, maybe even four good interceptions
[2570.32 - 2572.32] P:1732.68 E:0.096251 |  and just sniffing things out when they go wild.
[2572.32 - 2575.32] P:1910.04 E:0.081984 |  I think he gives full backs such good protection,
[2575.32 - 2578.32] P:1836.12 E:0.099527 |  he sees it developing certainly against a player like Vanessa's,
[2578.32 - 2581.32] P:1843.05 E:0.088886 |  he thinks, oh, I'll just drop in that hole because he's not the pacest,
[2581.32 - 2584.32] P:1825.08 E:0.092859 |  is he, if it gets into a foot race, he's in trouble against Vanessa's,
[2584.32 - 2587.32] P:1736.64 E:0.099683 |  but he's reading it again, you know, there's a couple of steps ahead
[2587.32 - 2589.32] P:1673.46 E:0.108821 |  and he just makes it look easy.
[2590.32 - 2596.32] P:1701.30 E:0.105367 |  188 appearances he played for, Atletico Madrid, the Ghanaian,
[2597.32 - 2603.32] P:1709.28 E:0.106904 |  it's Timber to Saka, near side the right, playing from left to right as we look.
[2603.32 - 2609.32] P:1802.83 E:0.078443 |  Timber will go short and square, Parte side on, Camarvingo approaches him,
[2609.32 - 2615.32] P:1759.82 E:0.090179 |  Saliba, Kivio along the ground, Declan Rice backpedals, 30 yards out from goal,
[2615.32 - 2619.32] P:1888.67 E:0.077710 |  short, Luis Skelly back towards Rice,
[2619.32 - 2621.32] P:1863.45 E:0.098964 |  Martinali's gone infield on the edge of the area.
[2622.32 - 2625.32] P:1766.80 E:0.101396 |  Again, the red and white shirts of Arsenal are in the heart,
[2625.32 - 2628.32] P:1783.70 E:0.091020 |  on the right-hand side as we look with 90 seconds remaining,
[2628.32 - 2631.32] P:1831.98 E:0.081538 |  Saliba now just comes forward,
[2632.32 - 2639.32] P:1728.16 E:0.086143 |  every grey shirt back behind the ball, Kivio just trying to wait for that one opening,
[2639.32 - 2643.32] P:1729.47 E:0.096359 |  having to be patient, Arasno, Thomas Parte, Urda Gar,
[2643.32 - 2648.32] P:1799.12 E:0.091602 |  just can't wander away from Camarvingo, but they do get it out towards Saka,
[2648.32 - 2653.32] P:1873.80 E:0.099598 |  and here he's belting him helping out Alibar infield to Parte, he goes square,
[2653.32 - 2657.32] P:1899.96 E:0.096877 |  Luis Skelly comes into a central area, battling for the ball, breaks back,
[2657.32 - 2661.32] P:1828.65 E:0.105474 |  Marina, he goes short, Parte helps it on towards Timber, promising,
[2661.32 - 2666.32] P:1818.99 E:0.111474 |  in comes the cross, and the ender, saved by Kouta, Martinali, Kouta again,
[2666.32 - 2670.32] P:1922.87 E:0.109470 |  back to his feet, he stood tall in his near post, double save from Kouta,
[2670.32 - 2675.32] P:1919.81 E:0.105351 |  now here's the danger at the other end, and Bapé, but Kivio was equal to it,
[2675.32 - 2680.32] P:1934.36 E:0.114419 |  and helps it all the way back towards Raya, it will not go in, Kouta with a double save.
[2680.32 - 2685.32] P:1783.50 E:0.108150 |  Great attack in play, really good defensive play from Kivio, David Raya there,
[2685.32 - 2689.32] P:1772.21 E:0.108987 |  difficult situation to mop up that losing ball with them, Bapé breathing down your neck,
[2689.32 - 2694.32] P:1806.87 E:0.103132 |  but they make it look easy, Arsenal creating a great chance, moving the ball,
[2694.32 - 2700.32] P:1860.79 E:0.105820 |  so swiftly, Luis Skelly, Parte, Rice with the header, two really good reaction saves from Kouta,
[2700.32 - 2703.32] P:1856.22 E:0.109247 |  Ramadrin under big pressure at the end of this first half.
[2703.32 - 2707.32] P:1939.02 E:0.103033 |  Here is Urda Gar, to Saka once again, good spell this for Arsenal,
[2707.32 - 2710.32] P:1984.92 E:0.094382 |  can they finish the half with a goal, Saka swings over the cross,
[2710.32 - 2714.32] P:1875.99 E:0.110858 |  Martinali tries to get on the end of it, but it goes all the way out of play,
[2714.32 - 2720.32] P:1870.42 E:0.095749 |  and out for a goal kick, but certainly there has been a lot to offer Miquel Arteta,
[2720.32 - 2722.32] P:1853.34 E:0.104810 |  and to encourage the Arsenal manager.
[2722.32 - 2728.32] P:1805.46 E:0.095259 |  Huge amount, really good attacking play, it's an early cross into the box from Tim,
[2728.32 - 2731.32] P:1715.75 E:0.099125 |  but what I like about Arsenal is, they're having to be more creative,
[2731.32 - 2735.32] P:1727.10 E:0.090670 |  they have to find a different way of being attacking, you know, they haven't got
[2735.32 - 2739.32] P:1811.89 E:0.095219 |  their first, second choice centre forward available, so they've got to find different options,
[2739.32 - 2743.32] P:1810.09 E:0.093853 |  and they're doing that with midfield players arriving, Rice it was that time,
[2743.32 - 2747.32] P:1850.52 E:0.083875 |  with the header, really sharp save from Kouta, made that look quite simple,
[2747.32 - 2753.32] P:1733.98 E:0.078097 |  and then the follow up from Martinali, some good attacking play from Arsenal.
[2753.32 - 2757.32] P:1764.21 E:0.087918 |  I think that answers the questions regarding the fitness of Kouta,
[2757.32 - 2762.32] P:1815.38 E:0.099464 |  with that muscle injury, how quickly he sprang back to his feet to make the second save.
[2762.32 - 2766.32] P:1795.69 E:0.097965 |  Top keeper, big bonus for Ramadrid that he's fitting available.
[2766.32 - 2770.32] P:1909.16 E:0.097280 |  Very much so, because otherwise they would have had problems,
[2770.32 - 2777.32] P:1846.88 E:0.093095 |  because Lunin, the number two, is out injured as well, he was an FA cup runner-up with Chelsea,
[2777.32 - 2786.32] P:1810.07 E:0.080403 |  losing to Arsenal in the final in 2017, but you look at his record against Arsenal
[2786.32 - 2791.32] P:1861.68 E:0.088863 |  during his time with Chelsea, 11 games, conceded 10, kept four clean sheets,
[2791.32 - 2797.32] P:1801.38 E:0.088066 |  three drew three, lost three, but very important saves that he's made there on the stroke of half-time.
[2797.32 - 2801.32] P:1817.09 E:0.104276 |  Two minutes have added on time, which we're now into, Camarvinga comes forward,
[2801.32 - 2807.32] P:1736.83 E:0.096813 |  Camarvinga goes behind Rodrigo, and behind Valverde, Rodrigo actually retrieves it himself,
[2807.32 - 2812.32] P:1743.06 E:0.089008 |  midway through the Arsenal half, now Arsenal have everybody back behind the ball.
[2812.32 - 2817.32] P:1861.56 E:0.104572 |  Here is Rudiger, to Modric, Modric forward, Bellingham with his back to goal,
[2817.32 - 2824.32] P:1781.07 E:0.091211 |  lays it back towards Camarvinga, threads it out towards Valverde, at the back of Martinelli.
[2824.32 - 2828.32] P:1792.41 E:0.107379 |  Valverde comes forward, right corner of the area, plays it back, Camarvinga to shoot from distance,
[2828.32 - 2832.32] P:1855.77 E:0.101384 |  left foot is always going away, off target, goal kick, nil-nil.
[2832.32 - 2839.32] P:1813.74 E:0.084653 |  Arsenal be delighted with that, they'll take shots from that kind of range, 25-30 yard efforts on goal all day,
[2839.32 - 2842.32] P:1772.79 E:0.087727 |  really good pressure, looked like Valverde was going to cross the ball,
[2842.32 - 2848.32] P:1869.07 E:0.081951 |  but was reluctant to stick it in the box, maybe such as Arsenal's ability to defend crosses,
[2848.32 - 2851.32] P:1821.78 E:0.108710 |  doesn't really encourage Madrid to put it in there.
[2851.32 - 2856.32] P:1852.67 E:0.107865 |  Well there is the half-time whistle, and at the break it's Arsenal nil, Real Madrid nil.
[2856.32 - 2861.32] P:1917.69 E:0.113479 |  We had Thomas Party shooting straight at Port Roy, he's made that double save from a right header
[2861.32 - 2866.32] P:1908.55 E:0.095848 |  and then Martinelli, and at the other end, Vinicius Jr. curled one wide,
[2866.32 - 2871.32] P:1881.09 E:0.088933 |  and Abapé had a shot that was saved by Raya. Your thoughts, Martinelli?
[2871.32 - 2873.32] P:1922.43 E:0.076962 |  Martinelli, definitely.
[2873.32 - 2880.32] P:2008.81 E:0.087060 |  I thought it was excellent, Dano, to be honest, I thought that Arsenal were superb in the first half.
[2880.32 - 2885.32] P:1956.57 E:0.085137 |  I don't think they could have had a much better first half performance than what they've just delivered.
[2885.32 - 2890.32] P:1880.25 E:0.090908 |  Real Madrid had their moments, the pace in the attack and the counter-attack,
[2890.32 - 2895.32] P:2016.09 E:0.097157 |  but Arsenal on the whole really got after them, created some good opportunities with the ball,
[2895.32 - 2900.32] P:1957.23 E:0.094303 |  great intensity, defensively looked pretty good, Kivviorz really managed the game well,
[2900.32 - 2904.32] P:1979.43 E:0.099599 |  and Lewis Skelly, the area that you think would be a little bit of a dubious area,
[2904.32 - 2910.32] P:1879.52 E:0.080431 |  has actually looked okay, and looking good for the second half has been a brilliant game to watch, I have to say.
[2910.32 - 2915.32] P:1902.92 E:0.086260 |  A high quality game, just lacking a goal, but at the break, Arsenal nil, Real Madrid nil.
[2915.32 - 2919.32] P:1831.66 E:0.111742 |  Ian Denison, Matthew Upton at the Emirates Forest this evening,
[2919.32 - 2925.32] P:1951.00 E:0.103259 |  it has been a really entertaining first half, but I don't want to sound like a broken record,
[2925.32 - 2931.32] P:1970.36 E:0.096079 |  but if Arsenal had an out-and-out number nine in there, this could be a very different scoreline.
[2931.32 - 2934.32] P:1992.03 E:0.081098 |  Yeah, we're all thinking it, aren't we?
[2934.32 - 2940.32] P:2048.81 E:0.082656 |  And yeah, there isn't too much to add to it, Kelly, that is the case.
[2940.32 - 2944.32] P:2059.07 E:0.095283 |  And while you can have all the quality, I think the full-backs have been good,
[2944.32 - 2949.32] P:2028.67 E:0.090555 |  Saka's been good, Marten Ali, Odegaard looks a bit brighter, is linking up well with Saka,
[2949.32 - 2954.32] P:2005.95 E:0.090466 |  but when that ball's rolling across, five yards out, all the way across the goal,
[2954.32 - 2958.32] P:2052.77 E:0.081743 |  and you haven't got that one instinctive player that just picks up the position,
[2958.32 - 2964.32] P:2072.88 E:0.096775 |  it's like a knack or a know-how. It's something that you kind of develop over time and instinct.
[2964.32 - 2969.32] P:2095.55 E:0.092808 |  It's hard to coach almost, it's just there, and that's their role, and that's their job.
[2969.32 - 2975.32] P:2100.16 E:0.092798 |  They just don't have that on the pitch, and whether or not that will define them in this tie,
[2975.32 - 2978.32] P:2091.59 E:0.092360 |  we'll have to wait and see, but it's certainly affected the first half,
[2978.32 - 2980.32] P:2070.44 E:0.098664 |  because I feel Arsenal could well be one nil up.
[2980.32 - 2984.32] P:1930.05 E:0.099369 |  And that's the concern, isn't it? As well as they've done in creating all these chances,
[2984.32 - 2990.32] P:1927.33 E:0.103656 |  by not converting them and then looking at the quality that Raoul Madrid have at the other end of the pitch,
[2990.32 - 2994.32] P:1935.96 E:0.099252 |  and some of the opportunities that they've created and not taken,
[2994.32 - 2998.32] P:1962.17 E:0.098944 |  you just feel there's a... We knew this before the game, there's a real threat there.
[2998.32 - 3002.32] P:2051.72 E:0.091873 |  Yeah, absolutely. It's got all the hallmarks, hasn't it, of one of those games where
[3002.32 - 3008.32] P:1967.47 E:0.087928 |  it's going to be a really good performance for Arsenal, but you end up coming away marginally losing the game.
[3008.32 - 3013.32] P:1977.50 E:0.095402 |  It's got that feel to it, because you know Raoul Madrid, they'll have that one good opportunity in the second half,
[3013.32 - 3017.32] P:1940.19 E:0.090051 |  and will one of their two centre forwards take that opportunity?
[3017.32 - 3021.32] P:2063.18 E:0.093043 |  I think you can bank more that they're going to be clinical, and they're going to make it count,
[3021.32 - 3024.32] P:1887.63 E:0.075969 |  and that's why they've got the record in this competition that they have.
[3024.32 - 3027.32] P:2031.61 E:0.107396 |  Matthew Ubson, Nia Dennis, thank you very much for now.
[3027.32 - 3032.32] P:1973.21 E:0.083600 |  We'll be back with both of them for the second half from the Emirates with the score at line at Arsenal nil.
[3032.32 - 3036.32] P:2048.86 E:0.090919 |  Raoul Madrid nil in this Champions League quarter-final, first leg.
[3036.32 - 3041.32] P:2196.92 E:0.099796 |  The other game taking place in the Champions League this evening by Munich against Inter Milan, Masferuci is watching.
[3041.32 - 3047.32] P:1748.28 E:0.078075 |  Well, Vincent company Kelly will be hugely frustrated because his buy-in side had the better of the first half chances in Munich,
[3047.32 - 3053.32] P:1427.35 E:0.102306 |  but they trail by a goal to nil, Inter's nine, Turaam setting up their 10 Martinez for the goal just before half-time,
[3053.32 - 3059.32] P:1632.33 E:0.086425 |  before that Kane had hit the right post with a swirling effort for Bayern after he's set up by Alise,
[3059.32 - 3062.32] P:1694.67 E:0.081084 |  who I have to say has been sparkling in this game so far tonight,
[3062.32 - 3066.32] P:1632.53 E:0.102564 |  but buying trail at half-time in the first leg by nil into one.
[3066.32 - 3070.32] P:1879.94 E:0.100925 |  And there's lots going on in the championship this evening.
[3070.32 - 3077.32] P:1763.93 E:0.104949 |  Rob Law is at Middlesbrough against Leeds and potentially Leeds could be top of the championship tonight Rob.
[3077.32 - 3083.32] P:2015.18 E:0.098240 |  They could indeed. Middlesbrough, nil, Leeds one at half-time Kelly, knowing a win could lift them back into the top two.
[3083.32 - 3088.32] P:1933.57 E:0.105026 |  Daniel Farkaside got off to an ideal start, Manusolomon with a low firm cross,
[3088.32 - 3092.32] P:2016.22 E:0.097052 |  and Dan James was on hand to fumble the ball home after just two minutes,
[3092.32 - 3096.32] P:2000.23 E:0.096878 |  Borah settled into the game well and thought that equalised through Tommy Conway,
[3096.32 - 3101.32] P:1968.65 E:0.101556 |  but the striker was offside and then it was Leeds turn, but they will feel really hard done by Kelly.
[3101.32 - 3106.32] P:2014.46 E:0.104051 |  They should be two nil up Tanaka tapped in following a deep cross from Suleiman once again,
[3106.32 - 3112.32] P:2049.87 E:0.105901 |  but the Japanese international was judged to be offside only for the replays to show that he was easily onside,
[3112.32 - 3115.32] P:1940.45 E:0.106573 |  of course, no VAR in the championship.
[3115.32 - 3119.32] P:1985.55 E:0.092553 |  Despite that, as things stand, Leeds sit top of the table.
[3119.32 - 3122.32] P:1922.96 E:0.097532 |  Middlesbrough one, sorry, Middlesbrough nil, Leeds one at the break.
[3122.32 - 3129.32] P:1980.42 E:0.087613 |  And as Rob said, that's because Sheffield United are trailing at home to Millwall and Burnley are goalless at Derby.

[3282.32 - 3287.32] P:2047.94 E:0.092662 |  Arsenal goal-less against Real Madrid at half-time at the Emirates in their Champions League quarter-final first leg.
[3287.32 - 3296.32] P:2105.56 E:0.088060 |  It's also, we'll keep you up to date with the game between Belgium and England in their Nations League match where Belgium lead by three goals to one.
[3296.32 - 3305.32] P:2056.32 E:0.086747 |  In League One this evening it's currently Bolton-Nil, Rotherham-1, Exeter-Nil, Wigan-1, Cottesfield-Nil, Wickham-Nil, Mansfield-1, Leighton-Orient-1,
[3305.32 - 3313.32] P:2081.54 E:0.086233 |  Peterborough-1, Birmingham-2. If it stays like that, three points mean that Birmingham will be promoted back to the championship at the first time of asking.

[3323.32 - 3328.32] P:2129.93 E:0.090612 |  Let's head to Augusta as we continue our build-up to the starter this week's first major of the men's season.

[3336.32 - 3343.32] P:2125.83 E:0.092209 |  Allie, first of all, Ian was telling us it feels very different this year and looks very different this year.
[3343.32 - 3350.32] P:2025.56 E:0.077344 |  Yeah, I've had my first proper walk-out on the golf course this afternoon actually, Kelly, because arrived yesterday drove through some horrendous rain.
[3350.32 - 3353.32] P:2114.04 E:0.088533 |  The worst I've ever seen in all the time I've ever come over here.
[3353.32 - 3360.32] P:2078.31 E:0.083094 |  So by the time we got here yesterday, the course was closed. Classic, beautiful spring, Georgia afternoon today though.
[3360.32 - 3368.32] P:2099.57 E:0.081299 |  And just going out onto the golf course just reminded me again year after year when you come here, it looks like everything is in high definition.
[3368.32 - 3376.32] P:2105.20 E:0.080170 |  The colours are so vivid and so perfect and the green of the grass is so sort of lush and verdant and the pale blue of the sky.
[3376.32 - 3385.32] P:2109.99 E:0.083193 |  And we always go by the old adage, Kelly, on the five-live golf team. The first golfer you see in the flesh during the week on the golf course could be the winner of the Masters this week.
[3385.32 - 3391.32] P:2079.09 E:0.077798 |  You're never going to believe who I saw on the Putting Green first up. World number one, Scotty Scheffler.
[3391.32 - 3396.32] P:1948.93 E:0.080363 |  The next person I see coming up the 18th fairway, world number two, Rory McElroy.
[3396.32 - 3399.32] P:2047.21 E:0.076155 |  And so many people are setting this up this week as Scheffler against McElroy.
[3399.32 - 3403.32] P:1960.97 E:0.079690 |  And the support actually, Kelly, is McElroy came off the back of the 18th green.
[3403.32 - 3408.32] P:1930.23 E:0.077668 |  Sort of the fans lined either side of the tunnel they'd made for him to walk back to the clubhouse.
[3408.32 - 3413.32] P:2005.35 E:0.071389 |  The groundswell of support for McElroy was really noticeable actually.
[3413.32 - 3421.32] P:2112.66 E:0.095848 |  He's tried so many times, hasn't he, to win this final major. Tricia, I know you arrived today. We heard from Rory McElroy a bit earlier.
[3421.32 - 3425.32] P:1898.16 E:0.087969 |  He sounded very calm. Could this be the year?
[3425.32 - 3430.32] P:1775.46 E:0.092855 |  Well, we all hope so, Kelly, don't we? I mean, we're all longing for the McElroy win at the Masters
[3430.32 - 3434.32] P:1911.61 E:0.076388 |  ever since the sort of capitulation, I suppose, in 2011.
[3434.32 - 3441.32] P:1946.96 E:0.087680 |  But I must say, I think this is the first time I can honestly think that he is the form horse going into this tournament.
[3441.32 - 3447.32] P:1840.22 E:0.089177 |  Obviously, he's won twice already this year. And he had a sixth place the last time he played in Houston.
[3447.32 - 3452.32] P:1893.01 E:0.089868 |  Pretty poor first round, but tremendous last sort of three rounds to get back into contention,
[3452.32 - 3456.32] P:1992.32 E:0.096170 |  which I think is all he really wanted. He just wanted to keep playing and didn't want to play last week.
[3456.32 - 3460.32] P:1977.57 E:0.091936 |  He knew the course wouldn't suit the sort of golf that he wanted to play this week.
[3460.32 - 3466.32] P:1930.85 E:0.093700 |  And I think he's in mentally and physically as good a form as I can ever remember going into a Masters.
[3466.32 - 3473.32] P:1951.82 E:0.082996 |  And for the first time, Sheffler, who obviously played very, very well himself at Houston,
[3473.32 - 3478.32] P:1834.97 E:0.085120 |  finishing in a tie for second place, but he's had one good tournament so far.
[3478.32 - 3485.32] P:1967.55 E:0.095058 |  So I think that just it's a little bit of sort of a difference to the previous years where Sheffler has been fantastic form coming into this week.
[3485.32 - 3492.32] P:1911.22 E:0.079394 |  It is McElroy that is the form horse, and hopefully that will give him the confidence to, and I think this is really important.
[3492.32 - 3498.32] P:1874.15 E:0.086446 |  I think he needs to go out and shoot a low number first round just to back up the confidence that we know he has.
[3498.32 - 3505.32] P:1999.25 E:0.090006 |  But he's always seems to be chasing here. And I think if you can get that really low round, you know, 65, 66, sort of first round,
[3505.32 - 3511.32] P:1937.29 E:0.080239 |  which is what he's been doing in his previous events that he's won, then we could be in for a very, very special week.
[3511.32 - 3515.32] P:1920.34 E:0.085967 |  Yeah, it could be fascinating this one. Ali, you were in Scottish Sheffler's press conference.
[3515.32 - 3522.32] P:2014.18 E:0.092075 |  I mean, apart from saying that it's been raining pollen, which sounds desperately unpleasant for him, how was he otherwise?
[3522.32 - 3530.32] P:2049.65 E:0.080628 |  Yeah, I mean, he's never dynamite in press conferences, Kelly, but his golf, you know, his golf is dynamite and has been at the Masters.
[3530.32 - 3537.32] P:2009.51 E:0.081035 |  I mean, it's funny you mentioned, you know, the pollen. A couple of questions he was asked was, you are sounding quite bunged up and how are you feeling?
[3537.32 - 3543.32] P:2104.64 E:0.080024 |  And I think the top line I picked out of it, and I'm saying this very much tongue-in-cheek, the sniffles aren't going to stop me this week,
[3543.32 - 3547.32] P:2014.11 E:0.088300 |  says Scotty Sheffler, ahead of Masters' defence. But no, that's not going to stop him.
[3547.32 - 3553.32] P:2072.42 E:0.081395 |  I think the other ominous thing that I picked out there, Kelly, just that he said, you know, and Trish was talking about his sort of,
[3553.32 - 3560.32] P:2052.10 E:0.075711 |  compared to last year, you know, when he won a couple of big tournaments coming into the Masters, he's not quite been in the same form this year,
[3560.32 - 3567.32] P:1903.39 E:0.071814 |  but he said in that press conference there, I feel very prepared for this tournament. I'm the most prepared I've been all season.
[3567.32 - 3574.32] P:2075.19 E:0.078000 |  So I think he feels his game is in good shape coming into this week. And that is ominous if you're any other player in this field.
[3574.32 - 3578.32] P:2099.71 E:0.085168 |  Thank you, Ali. Thank you, Trish. Make sure you're taking your anti-histamines.
[3578.32 - 3583.32] P:2073.52 E:0.088471 |  That was Alistair Bristol and Trish Johnson, part of our huge team that's over at the Masters.
[3583.32 - 3591.32] P:2054.07 E:0.078363 |  And there's full coverage of what could be a really special tournament, the 89th Masters from Thursday night on Five Sports Extra and BBC Sounds.
[3591.32 - 3600.32] P:2057.72 E:0.081627 |  Tomorrow night on Five Life, we're going to switch our focus from Arsenal at the Emirates to Paris for PSG against Aston Villa in their Champions League quarter-final first leg.
[3600.32 - 3607.32] P:2166.84 E:0.084645 |  Unai Emery would love for the tie still to be in the balance when they return to the Midlands next week in the City of Love for us tonight.
[3607.32 - 3609.32] P:2266.69 E:0.102045 |  It is John Murray. Good evening, John.
[3609.32 - 3618.32] P:1925.86 E:0.078059 |  Good evening, Kelly. Yes, I can take Ali and Trish's Augusta and I can give you Paris in the springtime where the weather has been glorious today.
[3618.32 - 3624.32] P:2024.60 E:0.073694 |  Sunshine and I'm in a little bistro here with red and white checked tablecloths.
[3624.32 - 3629.32] P:2009.10 E:0.078882 |  And I'm just waiting for something, some delicious French cuisine to be brought to me.
[3629.32 - 3636.32] P:1946.35 E:0.083532 |  And I'm very much looking forward also to what might be a delicious match between Paris Saint-Germain and Aston Villa.
[3636.32 - 3645.32] P:1934.43 E:0.084634 |  And what I would say is this has got, you know, how long we've been doing these things, these Champions League ties in the latter stages of this competition.
[3645.32 - 3656.32] P:2039.83 E:0.079525 |  And very often, of course, we are with the big English clubs, but this feels to be here with Aston Villa for a match like this just makes it feel completely different.
[3656.32 - 3669.32] P:1908.38 E:0.081951 |  As you know, they're in this competition for the first time for 42 years this season and they're in the quarter-finals and they've got a real match over the course of tomorrow night and next week at Villa Park, I think.
[3669.32 - 3678.32] P:2016.58 E:0.089462 |  Yeah, it's going to be fascinating to see how that one unfolds. It may be the City of Love, John, but it looks like Amy Martinez didn't quite get the memo. No love lost.
[3678.32 - 3685.32] P:1926.21 E:0.086173 |  No, and you know, this is going to be, it's probably all over the media right now. It will be in the morning as well.
[3685.32 - 3694.32] P:1920.34 E:0.079838 |  Amy Martinez, who's got his own personal history with France, as we know, beat them in the World Cup final and, you know, that is spilled over.
[3694.32 - 3702.32] P:1772.13 E:0.092596 |  Remember as well, the European tie against Lille last season, which went to that extraordinary penalty shootout where he was, you know, public enemy number one.
[3702.32 - 3720.32] P:1916.01 E:0.073963 |  Well, what did he do today? When they left for France, Amy Martinez came out into the sunshine wearing a baseball cap, which had on it a French cockerel, but also a badge with an Argentina flag that featured the trophies that have been won by Argentina with him in the team.
[3720.32 - 3726.32] P:1934.97 E:0.074391 |  You know, inflammatory is what I would call that. Is it wise? I'm not sure.
[3726.32 - 3730.32] P:2119.36 E:0.087271 |  But also, is it funny? And the answer is yes, it is funny.
[3730.32 - 3735.32] P:1948.05 E:0.093187 |  It's funny, but I'm not sure our French hosts will be laughing their heads off tonight.
[3735.32 - 3743.32] P:2081.53 E:0.085904 |  No, maybe not, maybe not. John Murray, thank you very much for joining us. Really looking forward to that one. PSG against Aston Villa in the Champions League quarterfinal.
[3743.32 - 3747.32] P:1980.31 E:0.098345 |  Let's get the very latest on Northern Ireland's game, Nicola McCarthy.
[3747.32 - 3752.32] P:1737.37 E:0.100265 |  Yes, all over in Belfast, Kelly, where I have to say the weather has been pretty decent today as well.
[3752.32 - 3757.32] P:1678.86 E:0.106618 |  It's finished 1-0 to Northern Ireland against Romania. That's Northern Ireland's second win of this Nations League campaign.
[3757.32 - 3762.32] P:1789.04 E:0.101690 |  A memorable first half goal for international 21-year-old Kasey Weir.
[3762.32 - 3766.32] P:1733.52 E:0.097024 |  Her first international goal, her strike, the difference between the two sides tonight.
[3766.32 - 3768.32] P:1339.31 E:0.105294 |  Full time in Belfast, Northern Ireland won Romania a-nil.
[3768.32 - 3772.32] P:1721.55 E:0.097117 |  Nicola, thank you very much all to play for at the Emirates.
[3772.32 - 3781.32] P:1869.86 E:0.096376 |  Where is Arsenal nil, Real Madrid nil, as we're about to head into the second half of their Champions League quarterfinal first leg with Matthew Upson and Ian Dennis.
[3781.32 - 3791.32] P:1996.06 E:0.108403 |  I don't notice the reference to City of Love in Paris. Well, here we are in London Town, waiting for the second half for Arsenal against Real Madrid.
[3791.32 - 3795.32] P:2059.45 E:0.110251 |  The Arsenal players are already out. Neither... They've not made a change.
[3795.32 - 3805.32] P:2100.96 E:0.110367 |  I can give you the Arsenal team. Ryering goal. Timbers to leave, Akivio and Luis Skelly, Erdogan, Rice and Pate, Saka, Marino and Martinelli.
[3805.32 - 3813.32] P:2085.50 E:0.108511 |  And then we wait for Real Madrid to appear as Carlo Ancelotti is... Here comes the referee.
[3813.32 - 3821.32] P:2100.02 E:0.109738 |  He's out and down in his dugout already. Whether to see whether he will make a change for the European champion.
[3822.32 - 3829.32] P:2110.05 E:0.108962 |  2009, by the way, that the last time that Arsenal reached the semi-final, when they were beaten by Manchester United,
[3829.32 - 3836.32] P:2083.09 E:0.105457 |  since then, Real Madrid have reached 12 semi-finals and they've won the competition six times.
[3836.32 - 3841.32] P:2080.20 E:0.107191 |  Yeah, they know what they're doing at this level. You wonder if they know what they're doing here.
[3841.32 - 3846.32] P:2094.33 E:0.100466 |  Just stalling, coming out, Arsenal out very early, Ancelotti out looking.
[3846.32 - 3850.32] P:2096.83 E:0.098327 |  I mean, he never looks face, does he? He doesn't look like he's...
[3850.32 - 3859.32] P:2159.61 E:0.102433 |  You know, there's any kind of rascal situation or pressure on him at all, but Madrid now out on the pitch, all together.
[3859.32 - 3865.32] P:2085.07 E:0.107426 |  Let's see what they can produce in this second half, whether or not they can take the game a little bit more to Arsenal
[3865.32 - 3869.32] P:2154.70 E:0.103278 |  or whether Arsenal can continue this good performance in this fixture.
[3869.32 - 3875.32] P:2012.82 E:0.103669 |  And they've made no alterations. So, Cortuari is in goal. Valverde, Rudiger, Asensio and Alaba
[3875.32 - 3878.32] P:1862.11 E:0.108055 |  and as Arsenal get the game restarted, that's the defence.
[3878.32 - 3882.32] P:1810.45 E:0.101036 |  Bellingham, Moderic and Camarvinger in the midfield, Rodrigo and Bapé in Vinicius Jr.
[3882.32 - 3888.32] P:1778.41 E:0.095425 |  They are all in grey and Real Madrid are playing from left to right as we look in this second half
[3888.32 - 3892.32] P:1835.10 E:0.097785 |  as the supporters file past us from our commentary position.
[3892.32 - 3897.32] P:1652.36 E:0.104234 |  Low down here tonight at the back of the press box, 0-0.
[3897.32 - 3902.32] P:1802.24 E:0.092279 |  Remember, Bayern 0-1 is a latest score in the other quarter-final
[3902.32 - 3908.32] P:1747.73 E:0.084872 |  and you've just heard from John Murray at half-time tomorrow night live for that game.
[3908.32 - 3912.32] P:1782.34 E:0.090216 |  Paris Saint-Germain against Aston Villa and we will stay in France for Thursday night.
[3912.32 - 3917.32] P:1795.02 E:0.105837 |  Lyon against Manchester United in the Europa League quarter-final first leg.
[3917.32 - 3924.32] P:1808.84 E:0.098236 |  Rice runs forward, left-hand side of the penalty area onto his right foot, the cross hits the head of Marino.
[3924.32 - 3929.32] P:1822.94 E:0.094808 |  Camarvingo lifted in the air, Saca then controls it back in possession for Arsenal.
[3929.32 - 3935.32] P:1853.92 E:0.096451 |  Pate hits it early, hits it hard, hits it low and it goes through to Courtois.
[3935.32 - 3942.32] P:1856.57 E:0.089176 |  And don't forget the US Masters begins on Thursday 2, day one, coverage from 8 o'clock on Sports Extra.
[3942.32 - 3947.32] P:1800.42 E:0.098370 |  And then we can look forward to five lives coverage from 8.30 to 10 on Five Live
[3947.32 - 3953.32] P:1830.75 E:0.085374 |  but full coverage on Sports Extra and then rounds three and four on Five Live on Saturday
[3953.32 - 3956.32] P:1807.49 E:0.090905 |  and Sunday night live from Augusta.
[3956.32 - 3961.32] P:1926.48 E:0.098962 |  Tonight, Five Live final score is available, the iPlayer, the red button, the BBC Sport website and app.
[3961.32 - 3965.32] P:1899.99 E:0.082698 |  And there's been a goal at Huddersfield in League One, Nikesh Raghane.
[3965.32 - 3969.32] P:1812.74 E:0.113627 |  And he's gone to the visitors, Wicca Mandeir, it's been coming for a little while now.
[3969.32 - 3973.32] P:1873.59 E:0.112499 |  Richard Kone with a smart ball to the left of the area to Daniel Udo,
[3973.32 - 3978.32] P:1829.39 E:0.093834 |  who struck first time with his left foot into the far corner, it's Huddersfield, Niel Wiccan 1.
[3978.32 - 3983.32] P:1940.55 E:0.102647 |  Other latest scores in that division, Shrewsby 1, Reading 2, Exeter Niel Wiccan 1.
[3983.32 - 3988.32] P:1865.24 E:0.095552 |  Preston 1, Cardiff 1 is the latest score in the championship, Blackburn have got a goal back,
[3988.32 - 3993.32] P:1905.51 E:0.097939 |  Blackburn 1, Sheffield Wednesday 2, Bristol City 1, West Bromwich Albion 1 is now a latest score
[3993.32 - 3999.32] P:1905.71 E:0.097786 |  because West Brom have got an equaliser and Leight Norien is leading 2-1 at Field Mill against Mansfield in League One.
[3999.32 - 4004.32] P:1876.43 E:0.094324 |  Timber on defensive duties, the Arsenal right back, back it goes to David Ryder,
[4004.32 - 4009.32] P:1871.52 E:0.088864 |  two minutes into the second half and I think more or less everybody now has taken to their seats around it.
[4009.32 - 4015.32] P:1841.32 E:0.094790 |  Thankfully, because it's a bit tricky actually seeing the pitches in it when the walkways are filled up with people
[4015.32 - 4021.32] P:1810.51 E:0.106353 |  coming back and forth and getting to their seat, but not too much happened in the start of the second half.
[4021.32 - 4026.32] P:1759.19 E:0.108739 |  I mean, Arsenal put the ball in very early with the Merino and when you have him in the box,
[4026.32 - 4031.32] P:1772.83 E:0.104116 |  you may as well stick it in there because for me his biggest attribute as a centre forward is his head inability.
[4031.32 - 4036.32] P:1817.22 E:0.107717 |  I think he gets up really well, punches the ball, gets good accuracy on his headers
[4036.32 - 4043.32] P:1817.65 E:0.106156 |  so if he can put a delivery in and get him to challenge either Rudiger or Asensio in the air,
[4043.32 - 4045.32] P:1785.52 E:0.093641 |  I think that's going to really test them.
[4045.32 - 4054.32] P:1796.17 E:0.100203 |  Here is Kevior, back it goes to Saliba, crossed the back line to that far side, the right, Timber.
[4054.32 - 4057.32] P:1875.56 E:0.120034 |  Arsenal supporters are trying to do their bit as well.
[4057.32 - 4060.32] P:1854.32 E:0.119811 |  Here come the red and white scarves being swelled around their head,
[4060.32 - 4063.32] P:1783.42 E:0.105733 |  some of the supporters rise to their feet as well.
[4063.32 - 4068.32] P:1696.59 E:0.103624 |  There's Timber on the halfway line, plays it back to Saliba.
[4068.32 - 4070.32] P:1797.68 E:0.083711 |  Another goal in Belgium, Flo Pollock.
[4070.32 - 4076.32] P:1872.43 E:0.094258 |  England have another goal back, Michelle Agimand on her first ever game for England,
[4076.32 - 4081.32] P:1748.13 E:0.091603 |  her first ever goal, Belgium 3 England, 2 England, trying to get back in this.
[4081.32 - 4085.32] P:1909.88 E:0.106680 |  Commentary continues on Sports Extra, Nil Nil here in the Champions League quarter final.
[4085.32 - 4090.32] P:1883.72 E:0.095824 |  Merino out towards Martinelli, on his toes, runs forward left-hand side of the area,
[4090.32 - 4095.32] P:1874.33 E:0.086398 |  left-footed grass, it's deep and it curls out of play and didn't get a touch on its way through.
[4095.32 - 4101.32] P:1904.13 E:0.093366 |  It will be a goal kick. Mansfield Town are now back level as well, Mansfield too, late in Orient too.
[4101.32 - 4105.32] P:1843.77 E:0.093983 |  But remember Birmingham City, the leaders are two and up at Peterbury United
[4105.32 - 4111.32] P:1864.05 E:0.090122 |  and that will mean that they are promoted back into the championship tonight.
[4111.32 - 4118.32] P:1890.31 E:0.102075 |  Vical Arteta talked yesterday about creating their own story.
[4118.32 - 4122.32] P:1869.13 E:0.089240 |  That banner that greeted the two teams earlier on, make it happen.
[4122.32 - 4127.32] P:1874.20 E:0.106394 |  Still waiting for something to happen as Lewis Skelly does well,
[4127.32 - 4130.32] P:1836.86 E:0.110358 |  leans into Rodrigo, wins the dual, up towards Merino,
[4130.32 - 4134.32] P:1876.48 E:0.106333 |  Moderic does enough, does it, got the ball.
[4134.32 - 4139.32] P:1916.19 E:0.102315 |  It was an important challenge because Arsenal could have been set away there by the Spanish international.
[4139.32 - 4142.32] P:1899.59 E:0.092311 |  It was a good decision from the referee, he just got a piece of the ball there,
[4142.32 - 4146.32] P:1911.23 E:0.086566 |  he was the wrong side of Merino but he's left foot,
[4146.32 - 4150.32] P:1881.66 E:0.084560 |  just got through enough to poke the ball away before he made the tackle.
[4150.32 - 4155.32] P:1875.89 E:0.094326 |  Remember Raheem Sterling was actually going through the longest drought of his club career,
[4155.32 - 4160.32] P:1837.69 E:0.099495 |  he's suspended tonight so I'm looking at attacking options on the bench for Arsenal
[4160.32 - 4166.32] P:1890.85 E:0.076218 |  and really you're looking at either Trossard or Waneeri.
[4166.32 - 4173.32] P:1796.61 E:0.091571 |  A couple of youngsters on there in Butler, Oya Deji and Jimmy Gower,
[4173.32 - 4181.32] P:1812.29 E:0.091207 |  there's a lot to ask them to come on though against the 15 times European champions
[4181.32 - 4184.32] P:1812.12 E:0.083076 |  and Carlo Ancelotti.
[4184.32 - 4188.32] P:1801.60 E:0.107420 |  He's actually taught that he might leave at the end of the season as Bellingham with a lay-off
[4188.32 - 4192.32] P:1911.49 E:0.105324 |  and then Bapé is in here and the angle is tight and he hits the side net.
[4192.32 - 4197.32] P:1797.28 E:0.104365 |  Left foot, some of the Real Madrid supporters on that far side
[4197.32 - 4201.32] P:1933.44 E:0.081450 |  where they'd be thinking that the net was about to bulge,
[4201.32 - 4204.32] P:1890.89 E:0.078629 |  all it was was the riffle of the side net.
[4204.32 - 4209.32] P:1808.72 E:0.098292 |  It was deceiving isn't it when you've got that angle and you see the net ripple like that,
[4209.32 - 4212.32] P:1924.43 E:0.094086 |  you think the ball's hit the back of the net but it hit the side of the net,
[4212.32 - 4217.32] P:1787.66 E:0.097392 |  angle was tight on the left hand side, Saliba was across just narrowing that angle,
[4217.32 - 4223.32] P:1804.96 E:0.094327 |  very tough position to score from even for some of the Bapé's calibre.
[4223.32 - 4226.32] P:1877.95 E:0.101741 |  Bellingham, mine has been a tight contest for you Matt.
[4226.32 - 4230.32] P:1860.28 E:0.097643 |  Do you think Arsenal have to take an advantage to Madrid next week?
[4230.32 - 4235.32] P:1879.74 E:0.075129 |  Of course it would be helpful but I don't think you have to.
[4235.32 - 4240.32] P:1818.82 E:0.094737 |  I think that maybe it'd be empoised that Neil might not be a bad thing,
[4240.32 - 4246.32] P:1876.62 E:0.093635 |  they'll go there, they'll play a different type of game you'd assume away from home
[4246.32 - 4252.32] P:1876.17 E:0.078996 |  and then it's all down to Madrid, the pressure's all on Real Madrid at that point at home to win the tight.
[4252.32 - 4256.32] P:1842.37 E:0.099335 |  That's the voice of Matthew Upsson, the former England international defender,
[4256.32 - 4259.32] P:1816.05 E:0.100818 |  Asaka passes the ball in, Erdogan right hand side,
[4259.32 - 4263.32] P:1834.90 E:0.086645 |  trying to nick it into the inside right channel for the onrushing.
[4263.32 - 4268.32] P:1848.85 E:0.092392 |  Bakai Asaka, but now Bellingham will stride and bring the ball clear
[4268.32 - 4272.32] P:1939.75 E:0.104769 |  and ahead of him he's got Vinicius Jr, who will run at real pace over on that far side,
[4272.32 - 4276.32] P:1817.45 E:0.105677 |  the left corner of the area and Bakai is available, here he is central,
[4276.32 - 4280.32] P:1944.79 E:0.092001 |  just outside the deep, helps on its way towards Rodrigo,
[4280.32 - 4283.32] P:1950.27 E:0.104068 |  but Arsenal now have so many red and white shirts back behind the ball,
[4283.32 - 4288.32] P:1897.38 E:0.097839 |  Moderic looking to turn, being viewed through because of those Tottenham connections of course,
[4288.32 - 4294.32] P:1859.08 E:0.108000 |  seven minutes into the second half as the temperature just starts to drop a little bit now in north London.
[4294.32 - 4298.32] P:1773.62 E:0.114463 |  I think that's the situation where Merino being in the team,
[4298.32 - 4302.32] P:1858.94 E:0.092152 |  while he's not quite giving you that centre forward dynamic aspect,
[4302.32 - 4304.32] P:1855.68 E:0.101570 |  when they're on the counter as a midfield player,
[4304.32 - 4308.32] P:1862.44 E:0.095169 |  he didn't have to drop back into the hole early and put Bakai under pressure,
[4308.32 - 4314.32] P:1865.42 E:0.094290 |  really good instinct from him just to get into the space and stop him Bakai from really driving with the ball.
[4314.32 - 4322.32] P:1830.93 E:0.081684 |  Moderic, Rudiger, Bakai out towards that far side,
[4322.32 - 4327.32] P:1840.39 E:0.092119 |  and then Alaba will pass it back to Moderic,
[4327.32 - 4330.32] P:1967.68 E:0.109408 |  who's now just inside the centre circle of the Arsenal half,
[4330.32 - 4334.32] P:1846.89 E:0.092759 |  and again Arsenal have got everybody back behind the ball,
[4334.32 - 4338.32] P:1899.36 E:0.091779 |  it is tight and it is tense at the Emirates here on 5-Live,
[4338.32 - 4344.32] P:1887.38 E:0.089522 |  and the BBC sounds out, Camavingga, Spritely, out now to Vinicius Jr,
[4344.32 - 4350.32] P:1944.80 E:0.096698 |  Speedy accelerates, cross from Alaba, swings it over, well caught by David Ryan,
[4350.32 - 4354.32] P:1895.76 E:0.112692 |  he's kept five clean sheets and he's nine champions for the games.
[4356.32 - 4359.32] P:1891.77 E:0.122095 |  Well, he caught the ball, he's looked to try and release it early,
[4359.32 - 4362.32] P:1863.63 E:0.106419 |  and then Camavingga has gone down on the far side,
[4362.32 - 4365.32] P:1877.08 E:0.093502 |  and the referee has Scott play,
[4365.32 - 4370.32] P:1897.63 E:0.084872 |  and a yellow card has been shown to Thomas Pate.
[4371.32 - 4377.32] P:1871.89 E:0.092057 |  Well, it's hard to really see why Camavingga is on the floor,
[4377.32 - 4380.32] P:1895.90 E:0.086991 |  there's a collision, a bit of a bump into Thomas Pate,
[4380.32 - 4385.32] P:1863.26 E:0.089794 |  his shoulder in the build-up to that cross come into the box,
[4385.32 - 4390.32] P:1823.44 E:0.092386 |  it does kind of, you know, edge into the side of the face of Camavingga,
[4390.32 - 4394.32] P:1705.26 E:0.098527 |  but it's not a bad impact, I think he's made the most of it,
[4394.32 - 4399.32] P:1857.37 E:0.091268 |  for the referee to stop the play when Arsenal and David Rea have caught the ball,
[4399.32 - 4401.32] P:1813.72 E:0.097971 |  and they have been good in those moments Arsenal,
[4401.32 - 4403.32] P:1890.22 E:0.086323 |  when Rea has come out and claimed the ball,
[4403.32 - 4405.32] P:1915.89 E:0.091750 |  he's really fizzed it forward quickly,
[4405.32 - 4407.32] P:1877.21 E:0.102741 |  because Real Madrid are committed, they've got players forward,
[4407.32 - 4410.32] P:1844.62 E:0.088031 |  they're on the attack, and that's when Arsenal can really hit them back,
[4410.32 - 4414.32] P:1871.53 E:0.086466 |  so the frustration was there from Arsenal when Pate picked up his yellow card,
[4414.32 - 4416.32] P:1907.06 E:0.100181 |  just letting the referee know.
[4417.32 - 4421.32] P:1915.90 E:0.096137 |  Wigan Athletic, who are only six points clear of the relegation zone in League One,
[4421.32 - 4423.32] P:1893.03 E:0.091286 |  they get to win since Ryan Lowe took charge,
[4423.32 - 4427.32] P:1852.40 E:0.092993 |  have been pegged back at Exeter, Exeter City One, Wigan Athletic One,
[4427.32 - 4430.32] P:1837.56 E:0.096922 |  Card of City remaining trouble, incidentally in the championship,
[4430.32 - 4433.32] P:1676.67 E:0.101840 |  Chris Preston are back in front, Preston North End Two,
[4433.32 - 4437.32] P:1785.45 E:0.096786 |  Card of City One is a latest score, ten minutes into the second half,
[4437.32 - 4441.32] P:1798.56 E:0.088330 |  it remains nil-nil between Arsenal and Real Madrid.
[4441.32 - 4445.32] P:1835.97 E:0.084513 |  Saliva into the centre circle, goes to his left,
[4445.32 - 4449.32] P:1892.90 E:0.093238 |  Kibir, stops short of the halfway line, and back it goes then to Saliva.
[4449.32 - 4453.32] P:1887.95 E:0.088592 |  Real Madrid, Grace Schertz have dropped up Arsenal, Timber.
[4454.32 - 4456.32] P:1907.26 E:0.110506 |  Lewis Skelly again has gone into that inverted roll,
[4456.32 - 4459.32] P:1885.63 E:0.096544 |  very, very central from left back, here is Thomas Pate,
[4459.32 - 4463.32] P:1891.73 E:0.102137 |  Lewis Skelly is an option, instead it comes towards Kibir.
[4463.32 - 4466.32] P:1868.57 E:0.108755 |  As a result of Lewis Skelly, he takes Rodrigo with him,
[4466.32 - 4469.32] P:1875.12 E:0.104593 |  as Rice to Martin, early left hand side level the area,
[4469.32 - 4473.32] P:1866.12 E:0.112494 |  Lewis Skelly to Declan Rice, and Ascencio saw the danger early,
[4473.32 - 4477.32] P:1899.83 E:0.103978 |  and he went to clear it, took an efflection on his way, and it's gone behind.
[4478.32 - 4480.32] P:1816.05 E:0.099834 |  And is it a throw?
[4482.32 - 4486.32] P:1737.21 E:0.104661 |  For Arsenal, but as Ascencio has got one in the face.
[4486.32 - 4490.32] P:1907.06 E:0.101022 |  Yeah, really ricocheted off of him, he comes out full steam from centre back position,
[4490.32 - 4494.32] P:1832.73 E:0.087292 |  Rice dangles his leg in, but the ball spins up,
[4494.32 - 4496.32] P:2020.74 E:0.092724 |  he really tries to smash the ball away,
[4496.32 - 4500.32] P:1908.92 E:0.087031 |  kicks through Declan Rice's right foot as well, he gets a bump on the foot,
[4500.32 - 4503.32] P:1866.01 E:0.087048 |  it's no nonsense Ascencio for centre back, isn't he?
[4503.32 - 4505.32] P:1851.51 E:0.088227 |  I mean, I've been really impressed with him in this game,
[4505.32 - 4509.32] P:1917.70 E:0.098352 |  the young 22-year-old for Real Madrid, he's had a very solid game,
[4509.32 - 4512.32] P:1885.88 E:0.082448 |  but he does enjoy defending, he comes out, and when he deals with the ball,
[4512.32 - 4514.32] P:1787.64 E:0.099663 |  he really puts his foot through it.
[4514.32 - 4517.32] P:1897.35 E:0.080789 |  He saw the danger early, and he reacted to it.
[4517.32 - 4522.32] P:1869.59 E:0.081853 |  Arsenal from the throw on the left-hand side, Lewis Skelly, back then to Kevior.
[4522.32 - 4529.32] P:1922.21 E:0.080826 |  Kevior back, left of the centre-circle, Saliba to Timber,
[4529.32 - 4533.32] P:1892.14 E:0.097920 |  along the ground, opens it up to the other side now, that far side the right,
[4533.32 - 4536.32] P:1941.83 E:0.089903 |  and coming in field is Saka, and still running inside is Saka,
[4536.32 - 4541.32] P:1890.77 E:0.112680 |  he's 25 yards out from goal, the referee will get a free kick, direct free kick,
[4541.32 - 4545.32] P:1904.10 E:0.111315 |  and ironic cheers from the Arsenal supporters, because the Bosnian referee,
[4545.32 - 4549.32] P:1921.56 E:0.102072 |  Erfan Piotr, has given a decision in their favour, 0-0.
[4549.32 - 4553.32] P:1833.07 E:0.095951 |  Yeah, Alaba just has too much of a nibble at this ball,
[4553.32 - 4557.32] P:1921.21 E:0.095169 |  Saka not really going anywhere, coming square inside the pitch,
[4557.32 - 4561.32] P:1881.98 E:0.090591 |  and Alaba just clips him, sticks his left foot across to try and toe it away,
[4561.32 - 4568.32] P:1906.59 E:0.080961 |  misses the ball and trips Saka, and gives away a free kick in a really interesting position.
[4568.32 - 4574.32] P:1897.80 E:0.103245 |  Mansfield Town 2, Lake Norway in 3, Shrewsbury 1, Reading 3, a latest scores in League 1.
[4574.32 - 4577.32] P:1874.49 E:0.074948 |  So 57 minutes play.
[4577.32 - 4581.32] P:1847.69 E:0.092383 |  I mean, you just mentioned the Arsenal bench, I mean, he's not going to play 90 minutes Saka, is he?
[4581.32 - 4583.32] P:1840.73 E:0.101823 |  He wouldn't have thought so.
[4583.32 - 4587.32] P:1818.90 E:0.092361 |  No, I think that would be a big win, even though with the magnitude of this game,
[4587.32 - 4592.32] P:1892.65 E:0.092796 |  that would be a huge risk, and both of the best moments in terms of creating goals
[4592.32 - 4596.32] P:1816.62 E:0.079393 |  for opportunities has to be said have come from him, haven't they?
[4596.32 - 4599.32] P:1878.38 E:0.087591 |  Getting crosses and getting to the byline, whipping it across.
[4599.32 - 4605.32] P:1844.24 E:0.089633 |  Even one area would be somebody who would, you would think would come on at some stage,
[4605.32 - 4610.32] P:1876.32 E:0.090138 |  but Saka takes three or four meaningful strides back for this free kick.
[4610.32 - 4614.32] P:1864.41 E:0.096883 |  It is fractionally right of centre, it's less than 30 yards out from goal.
[4614.32 - 4616.32] P:1877.63 E:0.106891 |  However, it's Declan Rice who hits it!
[4616.32 - 4619.32] P:1878.31 E:0.119980 |  Oh, and doesn't he hit it?
[4619.32 - 4621.32] P:1915.50 E:0.120068 |  Oh, yes, he hits it!
[4621.32 - 4624.32] P:1909.35 E:0.112952 |  It's a terrific strike!
[4624.32 - 4630.32] P:1855.40 E:0.114014 |  Barra said, make it happen, and Declan Rice has done exactly that!
[4630.32 - 4633.32] P:1750.64 E:0.111206 |  What a direct free kick!
[4633.32 - 4637.32] P:1851.76 E:0.115368 |  Right-butted, gave the keeper no chance, and Arsenal lead,
[4637.32 - 4641.32] P:1787.25 E:0.115686 |  rare Madrid by a golden hill!
[4641.32 - 4646.32] P:1795.68 E:0.106714 |  Oh, what a hit from Declan Rice.
[4646.32 - 4650.32] P:1787.90 E:0.110554 |  That is how to take a free kick.
[4650.32 - 4654.32] P:1799.89 E:0.118677 |  Everyone, I think, in the stadium, including Courtois,
[4654.32 - 4659.32] P:1895.58 E:0.116975 |  expecting Saka with his left foot lining this one up.
[4659.32 - 4664.32] P:1850.21 E:0.117816 |  And just the way Declan Rice approaches this ball, he runs at it first,
[4664.32 - 4667.32] P:1889.81 E:0.107562 |  whether or not they think he's going to just go over it and then Saka hits it.
[4667.32 - 4672.32] P:1834.11 E:0.107322 |  I'm not sure if Courtois is really ready, but it is absolute precision,
[4672.32 - 4675.32] P:1801.98 E:0.114153 |  and the beauty of it being on his right foot,
[4675.32 - 4678.32] P:1800.41 E:0.115465 |  he's able to bend it around the outside of the wall
[4678.32 - 4682.32] P:1865.74 E:0.102075 |  and probably isn't quite wide enough for a right footer.
[4682.32 - 4687.32] P:1802.70 E:0.113246 |  And he just hits it with so much power, it's an inch inside the post.
[4687.32 - 4692.32] P:1884.72 E:0.118363 |  Perfect hit, perfect position, what a goal from Declan Rice.
[4692.32 - 4697.32] P:1826.50 E:0.111005 |  It had the curl, it had the bend, it went round the foreman wall,
[4697.32 - 4700.32] P:1822.60 E:0.120473 |  it was a super effort by Declan Rice,
[4700.32 - 4704.32] P:1845.29 E:0.109063 |  who I actually thought there has won the ball against Luker Moderich.
[4704.32 - 4707.32] P:1870.29 E:0.102727 |  These decisions by a Bosnian referee tonight,
[4707.32 - 4710.32] P:1884.42 E:0.107425 |  but Arsenal are leading by a goal to nil.
[4710.32 - 4716.32] P:1783.86 E:0.111105 |  Now, can they keep a sixth clean sheet in this Champions League campaign
[4716.32 - 4721.32] P:1814.00 E:0.099489 |  to give them something valuable to take to Madrid next week?
[4721.32 - 4726.32] P:1867.55 E:0.112049 |  But they are leading by a goal to nil, raucous, raucous noise inside the Emirates.
[4726.32 - 4728.32] P:1755.89 E:0.109408 |  When I was looking at that free kick,
[4728.32 - 4731.32] P:1805.63 E:0.112582 |  and looking at the play standing over it in the back of my mind,
[4731.32 - 4735.32] P:1859.85 E:0.112940 |  it's going to have to be something really special to beat Courtois
[4735.32 - 4738.32] P:1819.38 E:0.101396 |  from that angle and from that distance.
[4738.32 - 4742.32] P:1816.06 E:0.121336 |  Well, didn't Declan Rice just step up and deliver something
[4742.32 - 4747.32] P:1808.38 E:0.110530 |  that was very much a special moment, brilliant free kick from him.
[4747.32 - 4750.32] P:1783.44 E:0.114252 |  Important game down at the bottom of the championship,
[4750.32 - 4754.32] P:1830.87 E:0.108707 |  and Stoke City have just taken the lead at home to Lutentown.
[4754.32 - 4760.32] P:1889.13 E:0.105420 |  So Stoke won Lutentown nil, but Arsenal are leading by a goal to nil,
[4760.32 - 4763.32] P:1736.30 E:0.096851 |  and we've been playing now for nearly an hour.
[4763.32 - 4766.32] P:1998.36 E:0.106676 |  But it's Vanessa's junior on that far side to left,
[4766.32 - 4769.32] P:1891.72 E:0.101811 |  his cross blocked and behind for a corner kick.
[4769.32 - 4771.32] P:1811.33 E:0.101441 |  By an inter, that's for Ruki.
[4771.32 - 4774.32] P:1680.52 E:0.102759 |  We played an hour, neither manager has made a change,
[4774.32 - 4776.32] P:1669.89 E:0.103575 |  but the goal scorer into Captain Martinez
[4776.32 - 4779.32] P:1753.25 E:0.105573 |  with another good chance feels like there could be more goals,
[4779.32 - 4781.32] P:1722.67 E:0.093142 |  and they still bar nil into one.
[4781.32 - 4783.32] P:1822.57 E:0.085185 |  And one nil to Arsenal.
[4783.32 - 4787.32] P:1854.47 E:0.098126 |  Real Madrid, they've got a corner kick.
[4787.32 - 4789.32] P:1910.40 E:0.113923 |  Carlos is actually here watching on.
[4789.32 - 4794.32] P:1742.54 E:0.096623 |  It's that type of free kick that he would have been proud of.
[4794.32 - 4797.32] P:1833.82 E:0.107269 |  But it's a corner kick, they've got to do some defending now.
[4797.32 - 4800.32] P:1900.38 E:0.113031 |  Moderates to take it, and it goes, and caught by David Ryan
[4800.32 - 4801.32] P:1870.27 E:0.096029 |  from the flip-header.
[4801.32 - 4804.32] P:1879.81 E:0.113680 |  Chesterfield have equalised at home to Dillingham 1-1.
[4804.32 - 4808.32] P:1839.86 E:0.106859 |  Ryan underarm throw out, Merino looks to go long towards Martinelli.
[4808.32 - 4811.32] P:1815.73 E:0.104649 |  Martinelli's away, Valverde the right back,
[4811.32 - 4814.32] P:1906.42 E:0.113037 |  walls pass the ball back towards Courtois
[4814.32 - 4816.32] P:1833.50 E:0.102412 |  and gets it away from underneath his feet
[4816.32 - 4818.32] P:1871.65 E:0.098454 |  and clears it long downfield.
[4818.32 - 4820.32] P:1947.60 E:0.108543 |  And all of a sudden this game has just gone up a notch.
[4820.32 - 4823.32] P:1892.88 E:0.114375 |  A great reading of the game from Valverde
[4823.32 - 4825.32] P:1901.13 E:0.119188 |  because Martinelli wanted the ball in the space.
[4825.32 - 4828.32] P:1931.80 E:0.101010 |  I think he just knows it's going to get hooked in there,
[4828.32 - 4832.32] P:1833.62 E:0.100516 |  drops it early, uses his understanding and experience
[4832.32 - 4834.32] P:1955.68 E:0.113265 |  of the situation just to tidy it up.
[4834.32 - 4837.32] P:1806.40 E:0.114762 |  But I think this is the best tap from Arsenal, if I'm honest.
[4837.32 - 4840.32] P:1863.15 E:0.109387 |  You don't want to sit off at this point, you've got the momentum.
[4840.32 - 4843.32] P:1879.61 E:0.099808 |  Really now take the game to Real Madrid, see if you can get a second.
[4843.32 - 4845.32] P:1894.28 E:0.089854 |  Erdogan leaves it for Saka.
[4845.32 - 4849.32] P:1800.07 E:0.098647 |  Saka now teases his way to the edge of the area.
[4849.32 - 4851.32] P:1848.54 E:0.091710 |  Goes to the floor,
[4851.32 - 4854.32] P:1863.06 E:0.092534 |  Camarvingo will run it clear for Real Madrid,
[4854.32 - 4856.32] P:1892.93 E:0.087861 |  out towards Venetius Junior.
[4856.32 - 4858.32] P:1877.79 E:0.108158 |  Lerkingen now accelerating his imbap,
[4858.32 - 4860.32] P:1894.70 E:0.116288 |  but the ball is cut out easily by Saliva.
[4860.32 - 4862.32] P:1904.37 E:0.109791 |  Reis helps it on its way.
[4862.32 - 4866.32] P:1914.30 E:0.104470 |  Merino dropping a little bit deep now to Erdogan
[4866.32 - 4869.32] P:1925.97 E:0.109223 |  and Arsenal will just go through the various phases of the field
[4869.32 - 4872.32] P:1809.38 E:0.102003 |  and downfield in control, leading by a goal to nil.
[4872.32 - 4875.32] P:1767.34 E:0.099045 |  Here is Declan Reis along the ground, finds Erdogan.
[4875.32 - 4879.32] P:1868.16 E:0.104087 |  Erdogan out towards Saka, right corner of the area.
[4879.32 - 4883.32] P:1809.30 E:0.079693 |  Saka into the box, he goes, wins the corner.
[4883.32 - 4886.32] P:1913.40 E:0.121720 |  Arsenal lead 1-0, corner kick far side the right.
[4886.32 - 4889.32] P:1949.69 E:0.107135 |  Well, this place is absolutely bouncing
[4889.32 - 4893.32] P:1856.08 E:0.114465 |  and a corner is a great opportunity for Arsenal.
[4893.32 - 4896.32] P:1818.65 E:0.112807 |  They're going to take their time, they're going to save at this little moment.
[4896.32 - 4900.32] P:1738.73 E:0.119612 |  They've got a bit of momentum and they're going to set this up.
[4900.32 - 4902.32] P:1753.85 E:0.114531 |  It's all about the delivery.
[4902.32 - 4906.32] P:1783.64 E:0.105926 |  It's Saka over the far side with his left foot.
[4906.32 - 4908.32] P:1866.58 E:0.113542 |  If the quality of delivery is there,
[4908.32 - 4912.32] P:1789.63 E:0.106410 |  this is going to be a difficult situation for Real Madrid to have to handle.
[4914.32 - 4919.32] P:1784.91 E:0.112078 |  Well, Saka waits to take the corner kick far side the right.
[4921.32 - 4925.32] P:1824.65 E:0.117983 |  Crackling atmosphere inside the Emirates.
[4926.32 - 4929.32] P:1742.49 E:0.110871 |  Wait for the delivery and it comes now.
[4929.32 - 4931.32] P:1838.52 E:0.103643 |  Courtois, that's a good claim.
[4931.32 - 4935.32] P:1845.02 E:0.088896 |  Two-handed above everybody's heads inside that crowded penalty area
[4935.32 - 4937.32] P:1884.98 E:0.104844 |  from the former Chelsea man.
[4937.32 - 4941.32] P:1908.33 E:0.093038 |  And Mikhail Artheta, his team,
[4941.32 - 4946.32] P:1876.26 E:0.094168 |  Arsenal supporters, everybody rising to see what's required of them here tonight.
[4946.32 - 4949.32] P:1951.75 E:0.102736 |  But 63 minutes to go, there is still a lot of weight of football
[4949.32 - 4954.32] P:1777.39 E:0.079927 |  and it's worth noting that Real Madrid
[4954.32 - 4959.32] P:1796.15 E:0.105330 |  have only failed to score once in 15 games since the start of February.
[4959.32 - 4966.32] P:1735.70 E:0.110173 |  That was against Atletico in the previous round in the Champions League.
[4966.32 - 4971.32] P:1808.91 E:0.111827 |  But Arsenal are protecting their own proud European record.
[4971.32 - 4977.32] P:1838.16 E:0.111454 |  They're unbeaten in 16 home UEFA games going all the way back to 2021.
[4977.32 - 4981.32] P:1928.72 E:0.115681 |  Courtois wasn't aware of Arsenal's record in the Champions League
[4981.32 - 4984.32] P:1910.41 E:0.109423 |  but they've not lost in the last two years here inside this stadium.
[4984.32 - 4989.32] P:1856.19 E:0.108039 |  It is turning into a fortress and Arsenal do have a slender league.
[4989.32 - 4992.32] P:1699.52 E:0.105237 |  It's interesting how little Drew Bellingham's really had an influence
[4992.32 - 4995.32] P:1687.53 E:0.099759 |  on this game with the ball for Real Madrid.
[4995.32 - 4999.32] P:1819.33 E:0.093045 |  And Arsenal have done a great job of stopping them getting into their rhythm.
[4999.32 - 5003.32] P:1864.76 E:0.089679 |  Certainly through the midfield, it was a hot talking point before the game.
[5003.32 - 5005.32] P:1775.54 E:0.083894 |  But they've now got something to hang on to Arsenal.
[5005.32 - 5008.32] P:1899.59 E:0.095104 |  It's got that feel about it, they've got that goal
[5008.32 - 5011.32] P:1870.89 E:0.080674 |  and now can they hang on to it or even build on it?
[5011.32 - 5015.32] P:1945.00 E:0.094159 |  Real Madrid still looking to score their first goal against Arsenal.
[5015.32 - 5018.32] P:1899.87 E:0.098289 |  This is the third time that they've met them but Vinicius Jr.
[5018.32 - 5021.32] P:1891.65 E:0.114135 |  Bursts into the penalty area, Reiszto clears the ball away
[5021.32 - 5025.32] P:1951.75 E:0.085134 |  and it goes out of play for a throw on that far side.
[5027.32 - 5030.32] P:1876.17 E:0.107888 |  It's slow to come back from the Arsenal supporters as it...
[5030.32 - 5033.32] P:1834.35 E:0.099530 |  Another ball is picked up off the cone by Alibar
[5033.32 - 5036.32] P:1883.43 E:0.104386 |  on that far side of the left to Rudiger.
[5039.32 - 5044.32] P:1806.38 E:0.103446 |  Now Rodrigo, Martinelli helping out, Louis Skelly.
[5044.32 - 5050.32] P:1823.69 E:0.105899 |  The winners of this type will play the winners of Aston Villa.
[5050.32 - 5054.32] P:1913.11 E:0.107508 |  Paris, Ajumman, the semi-final schedule will be communicated
[5054.32 - 5056.32] P:1733.86 E:0.095975 |  on the 17th of April.
[5056.32 - 5059.32] P:1847.26 E:0.110419 |  We'll have commentary in Paris tomorrow of that first leg.
[5059.32 - 5065.32] P:1781.58 E:0.102331 |  But Arsenal here, a 1-0 up as Bellingham chips the ball in towards Mbappe
[5065.32 - 5068.32] P:1908.76 E:0.105433 |  and again Davin Raya quickly off his goal line.
[5068.32 - 5071.32] P:1796.62 E:0.111268 |  Worth reiterating, they're unbeaten in the first leg
[5071.32 - 5074.32] P:1852.42 E:0.121051 |  in all seven of their previous Champions League quarter-finals
[5074.32 - 5076.32] P:1758.37 E:0.114835 |  and they're leading now.
[5079.32 - 5083.32] P:1679.08 E:0.110389 |  A cacophony of noise at the end of the stadium.
[5083.32 - 5087.32] P:1814.19 E:0.115118 |  Louis Skelly, short ball towards Thomas Pate.
[5087.32 - 5090.32] P:1771.84 E:0.104200 |  Asked you the question earlier about the fitness of Saka.
[5090.32 - 5093.32] P:1729.03 E:0.108048 |  What to do about Pate as well, Beringham-Henemanes with the yellow.
[5093.32 - 5095.32] P:1871.26 E:0.111246 |  Do you just have to show and keep Pate?
[5095.32 - 5098.32] P:1830.83 E:0.106345 |  Yeah, I think so. I think you trust him to manage the game.
[5098.32 - 5101.32] P:1659.33 E:0.106153 |  Will there be a moment where he makes a rash choice?
[5101.32 - 5104.32] P:1930.42 E:0.113703 |  Here he is, his forward ball, Rice just couldn't take it in the stride.
[5104.32 - 5107.32] P:1912.37 E:0.091231 |  It was a lovely waited pass to him by Thomas Pate.
[5107.32 - 5109.32] P:1789.91 E:0.097025 |  He's having an outstanding game.
[5110.32 - 5114.32] P:1836.87 E:0.107058 |  I think Ram Madrid are struggling to deal with that movement from midfield.
[5114.32 - 5117.32] P:1855.85 E:0.112538 |  There's one or two players here, Rice or Odegaard,
[5117.32 - 5121.32] P:1841.94 E:0.111833 |  that are actually making really well timed runs in and around the centre-backs.
[5121.32 - 5124.32] P:1932.48 E:0.105387 |  Anyone really knows whose responsibility is to go with him
[5124.32 - 5128.32] P:1854.71 E:0.094878 |  and they're just finding little pockets every now and then if the pass is right.
[5129.32 - 5134.32] P:1759.14 E:0.098497 |  Here is Thomas Pate, out to Saka on that far side, the right.
[5136.32 - 5138.32] P:1799.25 E:0.106410 |  He waits, actually comes to a standstill.
[5138.32 - 5141.32] P:1818.53 E:0.090174 |  Beringham, his England colleague is in front of him.
[5141.32 - 5143.32] P:1769.57 E:0.089990 |  They go back, Saliba.
[5143.32 - 5147.32] P:1765.45 E:0.086644 |  1-0 to Arsenal, we're approaching the midway point of the second half.
[5147.32 - 5152.32] P:1794.25 E:0.096409 |  Kevior, towards Rice, helps on its way to Martinelli.
[5152.32 - 5157.32] P:1805.43 E:0.095291 |  Valdiverny backpedal, Martinelli now towards Lewis Skelly.
[5157.32 - 5159.32] P:1836.15 E:0.083941 |  Back in field then to Kevior.
[5159.32 - 5162.32] P:1823.53 E:0.094937 |  Credit Kevior, haven't really missed Gabrielle tonight.
[5162.32 - 5164.32] P:1807.55 E:0.093209 |  Here is Rice to Lewis Skelly.
[5164.32 - 5168.32] P:1905.87 E:0.103966 |  He's doing well, still battling for it, Lewis Skelly to Martinelli.
[5168.32 - 5171.32] P:1784.48 E:0.117719 |  Save, rebound, blocks, comes to Merino.
[5171.32 - 5173.32] P:1797.18 E:0.122796 |  Save the game by Corteur.
[5173.32 - 5176.32] P:1877.29 E:0.115233 |  Three bites they had at that.
[5176.32 - 5180.32] P:1876.25 E:0.107952 |  And Corteur was equal to it to tip it over the crossbar.
[5180.32 - 5182.32] P:1955.32 E:0.105975 |  Arsenal almost had a second.
[5184.32 - 5187.32] P:1878.28 E:0.116315 |  What a ridiculous passage of play.
[5187.32 - 5192.32] P:1852.68 E:0.108827 |  I mean, the last save from Corteur is some reaction.
[5192.32 - 5194.32] P:1762.02 E:0.111692 |  Arsenal fiddled it through in the box.
[5194.32 - 5197.32] P:1734.22 E:0.094202 |  I mean, that is on the line.
[5197.32 - 5201.32] P:1804.44 E:0.108953 |  It's a defending player on the line, the first save from Corteur's parried away.
[5201.32 - 5205.32] P:1825.44 E:0.108089 |  Now I think he's David Allibar, who's on the line as Merino pings it with his left foot.
[5206.32 - 5209.32] P:1802.06 E:0.105249 |  He makes a brilliant goal line clearance with his left foot.
[5209.32 - 5212.32] P:1884.99 E:0.096160 |  Saves a certain goal back to Merino, chests it down.
[5212.32 - 5214.32] P:1763.50 E:0.089186 |  He's got a bit of the time.
[5214.32 - 5219.32] P:1898.36 E:0.090670 |  He just strikes it cleanly with the left foot and Corteur tips it over the crossbar.
[5219.32 - 5221.32] P:1878.53 E:0.101114 |  What a piece of goalkeeping.
[5221.32 - 5224.32] P:1839.15 E:0.109243 |  In comes the corner, and that one's cleared away as well.
[5224.32 - 5227.32] P:1826.80 E:0.110748 |  It was played back in low, I think it ran him in from Declan Rice.
[5227.32 - 5230.32] P:1947.88 E:0.100852 |  He hit it low, left footed. The keeper made the save.
[5230.32 - 5234.32] P:1799.60 E:0.098487 |  Jude Bellingham, I think it was behind him who made the clearance for that goal-bound shot.
[5234.32 - 5237.32] P:1894.80 E:0.095456 |  Arsenal are knocking at the door.
[5237.32 - 5239.32] P:1958.22 E:0.117969 |  They've got the ante of Arsenal.
[5239.32 - 5241.32] P:1860.46 E:0.106727 |  Sakha was caught, referee will play the advantage.
[5241.32 - 5245.32] P:1803.23 E:0.109942 |  No, he won't, they'll bring it back for a free kick, but Sakha's in pain.
[5245.32 - 5249.32] P:1866.18 E:0.113718 |  Sakha's in pain, free kick to Arsenal. They lead by a goal to nil.
[5249.32 - 5251.32] P:1863.01 E:0.094732 |  We're going to Belgium, Flo Pollock.
[5251.32 - 5253.32] P:1793.50 E:0.098767 |  Inger, they've fallen two to feet.
[5253.32 - 5256.32] P:1820.51 E:0.100833 |  Belgium three, Ingen two, despite that stunning goal.
[5256.32 - 5258.32] P:1828.85 E:0.096592 |  David's goal for Michel Agiman, full-time here.
[5258.32 - 5260.32] P:1767.27 E:0.082416 |  Belgium three, Ingen two.
[5260.32 - 5264.32] P:1841.30 E:0.091679 |  It was Camavinga just catching Pukajah Sakha.
[5264.32 - 5268.32] P:1784.43 E:0.089470 |  I didn't like the way he banged the turf there for a moment, Sakha.
[5268.32 - 5271.32] P:1851.31 E:0.085461 |  It was Bellingham in that chance a moment ago.
[5271.32 - 5274.32] P:1826.53 E:0.100315 |  Rice with his left foot, steering it into the corner.
[5274.32 - 5277.32] P:1910.94 E:0.084522 |  The ball's past Courtois, and Bellingham standing behind him,
[5277.32 - 5280.32] P:1827.72 E:0.103496 |  doing the job on the line, clearing it away.
[5280.32 - 5284.32] P:1828.95 E:0.098189 |  Real Madrid absolutely hanging on here at the moment at the Emirates.
[5284.32 - 5288.32] P:1879.30 E:0.092054 |  And Arsenal are in a brilliant vein of confidence
[5288.32 - 5290.32] P:1906.73 E:0.087047 |  and form and rhythm.
[5290.32 - 5292.32] P:1904.46 E:0.093770 |  We've got Marino laying on the floor.
[5292.32 - 5295.32] P:1824.23 E:0.097132 |  He looks in a bad condition. Sakha's back up on his feet.
[5295.32 - 5298.32] P:1903.92 E:0.098000 |  Hopefully he can shake it off, because I tell you what,
[5298.32 - 5300.32] P:1905.62 E:0.090789 |  they've got to try and capitalise on this situation,
[5300.32 - 5302.32] P:1882.82 E:0.094828 |  because Madrid are rocked.
[5302.32 - 5304.32] P:1878.60 E:0.095659 |  They're completely rocked at the moment,
[5304.32 - 5306.32] P:1827.25 E:0.081342 |  and Arsenal have to keep the pressure high.
[5306.32 - 5309.32] P:1806.22 E:0.099877 |  There was another Arsenal player down at the Marino,
[5309.32 - 5312.32] P:1870.12 E:0.099267 |  actually inside the penalty house, focusing purely on Sakha.
[5312.32 - 5315.32] P:1690.63 E:0.094198 |  But Marino, I think, has possibly been winded.
[5315.32 - 5317.32] P:1802.41 E:0.096085 |  He's just on his haunches at the moment,
[5317.32 - 5320.32] P:1657.72 E:0.099037 |  but a direct free-kick it will be to Arsenal,
[5320.32 - 5324.32] P:1770.34 E:0.100792 |  who lead by a goal to Niel, and they have been terrific second half.
[5324.32 - 5326.32] P:1735.04 E:0.083067 |  Who's on this free-kick?
[5326.32 - 5328.32] P:1727.06 E:0.080800 |  Wow.
[5328.32 - 5331.32] P:1861.37 E:0.091191 |  Surely Rice has got this one as well, isn't he?
[5331.32 - 5333.32] P:1785.55 E:0.085877 |  I mean, he's...
[5333.32 - 5336.32] P:1892.34 E:0.086781 |  It's further out, it favours a right foot or more.
[5336.32 - 5339.32] P:1846.26 E:0.098617 |  It's probably a little bit more in field as well, more central, isn't it?
[5339.32 - 5340.32] P:1854.50 E:0.056922 |  Yeah.
[5340.32 - 5343.32] P:1875.82 E:0.098304 |  But it's not too dissimilar from the distance where he did score.
[5343.32 - 5345.32] P:1951.00 E:0.105718 |  The only goal of the game so far.
[5345.32 - 5347.32] P:1930.44 E:0.095490 |  It's just the other side of the 18-yard box,
[5347.32 - 5350.32] P:1855.30 E:0.090051 |  and I think everyone expected Sakha on the first one, didn't they?
[5350.32 - 5353.32] P:1822.26 E:0.078851 |  I mean, it was lined up, it was a left foot aside.
[5354.32 - 5358.32] P:1864.89 E:0.087217 |  Erdogan or Rice, Arsenal lead 1-0.
[5358.32 - 5361.32] P:1964.18 E:0.113273 |  Declan Rice runs now, hits it right footed!
[5361.32 - 5365.32] P:1819.25 E:0.118859 |  Oh! Rice, Rice, baby!
[5366.32 - 5368.32] P:1828.69 E:0.126785 |  Oh, my word!
[5368.32 - 5370.32] P:1856.20 E:0.124929 |  Two absolute belters!
[5370.32 - 5372.32] P:1788.03 E:0.111635 |  Right footed!
[5372.32 - 5374.32] P:1660.16 E:0.110830 |  Shot right hand corner!
[5375.32 - 5379.32] P:1878.14 E:0.123864 |  Arsenal lead round the drain by two goals to Niel!
[5381.32 - 5383.32] P:1867.96 E:0.119176 |  Unbelievable.
[5384.32 - 5387.32] P:1833.12 E:0.111012 |  I don't think anyone expected that to happen.
[5388.32 - 5389.32] P:1888.47 E:0.119460 |  I mean, why not?
[5389.32 - 5391.32] P:1845.39 E:0.109230 |  Because the first one was an absolute screemer,
[5391.32 - 5393.32] P:1779.71 E:0.102468 |  and you think he can't beat that.
[5393.32 - 5396.32] P:1727.16 E:0.111398 |  He can't hit a better free-kick than the first one.
[5396.32 - 5399.32] P:1711.15 E:0.117005 |  In fact, I didn't even know if he was going to take it.
[5400.32 - 5403.32] P:1824.42 E:0.121256 |  What a swagger he has about him, Declan Rice.
[5403.32 - 5408.32] P:1826.32 E:0.112492 |  I have to say, the confidence that this lad has in himself
[5408.32 - 5410.32] P:1842.65 E:0.108327 |  is absolutely top draw.
[5410.32 - 5413.32] P:1791.63 E:0.105186 |  This free-kick is absolutely superb.
[5413.32 - 5416.32] P:1802.96 E:0.110256 |  It has bend, it has power.
[5417.32 - 5419.32] P:1758.57 E:0.119647 |  I'm not too sure about the wall.
[5419.32 - 5423.32] P:1843.61 E:0.103454 |  I have to say, there's big question marks over the setup
[5423.32 - 5426.32] P:1833.85 E:0.099267 |  of Real Madrid and Courtois,
[5426.32 - 5429.32] P:1749.88 E:0.111616 |  but nonetheless, this is a cleanly hit free-kick
[5429.32 - 5434.32] P:1811.68 E:0.109378 |  that is just about six inches below the crossbar
[5434.32 - 5439.32] P:1834.27 E:0.100777 |  next to the post in the postage stamp of the top corner of the net.
[5439.32 - 5441.32] P:1833.10 E:0.110213 |  The Emirates stadium cannot believe the supporters around us,
[5441.32 - 5445.32] P:1872.87 E:0.107363 |  they know, were just off their seats running around the aisles.
[5445.32 - 5449.32] P:1793.94 E:0.107727 |  What a brilliant double free-kick special from Declan Rice.
[5449.32 - 5451.32] P:1813.80 E:0.114034 |  Will you say the postage stamp?
[5451.32 - 5454.32] P:1789.61 E:0.114588 |  In Denmark, they would say that is the free market
[5454.32 - 5456.32] P:1831.78 E:0.098808 |  right in the corner.
[5456.32 - 5459.32] P:1723.99 E:0.110720 |  And as a gentleman, he's still getting his breath back now.
[5459.32 - 5461.32] P:1809.39 E:0.104810 |  I'm actually a little bit concerned for him.
[5461.32 - 5464.32] P:1845.64 E:0.100426 |  But I watched him mouth, unbelievable.
[5464.32 - 5468.32] P:1822.78 E:0.108533 |  He's actually leaning back on his chair.
[5468.32 - 5471.32] P:1738.06 E:0.109815 |  He's expended that much energy.
[5471.32 - 5475.32] P:1811.34 E:0.109978 |  But Declan Rice with two absolute beauties
[5475.32 - 5479.32] P:1776.76 E:0.117997 |  and all of a sudden now Arsenal lead the European champions
[5479.32 - 5481.32] P:1781.21 E:0.106786 |  by two goals to nil.
[5481.32 - 5483.32] P:1822.10 E:0.097039 |  They've made a change, incidentally.
[5483.32 - 5485.32] P:1836.86 E:0.106239 |  Declan Mavinga looks forward.
[5485.32 - 5488.32] P:1849.35 E:0.121440 |  Alaba heads the ball, caught by David Ryan.
[5488.32 - 5491.32] P:1924.08 E:0.107563 |  Lucas Moderich has gone off the field of play.
[5491.32 - 5495.32] P:1817.10 E:0.098300 |  Lucas Vazquez has come on to replace him in the centre of midfield.
[5495.32 - 5499.32] P:1788.31 E:0.102636 |  And there's an Arsenal player down and it is Dukai Osaka.
[5499.32 - 5503.32] P:1826.26 E:0.097683 |  Whilst there is a stoppage here, I can tell you that Malumbi's been sent off
[5503.32 - 5506.32] P:1712.85 E:0.097618 |  for West Bromwich Albion.
[5506.32 - 5509.32] P:1851.78 E:0.098831 |  West Bromwich Albion still drawing 1-1.
[5509.32 - 5512.32] P:1913.94 E:0.110275 |  Blackburn 2, Sheppield Wednesday 2 is the latest score.
[5512.32 - 5515.32] P:1643.34 E:0.106397 |  So Blackburn have got an equaliser at Inwood
[5515.32 - 5518.32] P:1750.82 E:0.108426 |  and will get an update from Middlesbrough with Rob Law.
[5518.32 - 5520.32] P:1834.16 E:0.117991 |  Middlesbrough Nail leads 1.
[5520.32 - 5523.32] P:1808.68 E:0.114802 |  Jor Pyrrhu Dan James of Bork have chances to extend the lead for Leeds
[5523.32 - 5525.32] P:1759.48 E:0.107323 |  at the start of the second half.
[5525.32 - 5527.32] P:1873.71 E:0.099351 |  Middlesbrough asking questions themselves.
[5527.32 - 5529.32] P:1820.11 E:0.103093 |  A captivating game, 73 minutes gone.
[5529.32 - 5531.32] P:1685.76 E:0.105019 |  Middlesbrough Nail leads 1.
[5531.32 - 5535.32] P:1772.77 E:0.107911 |  So the Leeds United still leading going top
[5535.32 - 5537.32] P:1832.92 E:0.110634 |  because Burnley drawing at Derby.
[5537.32 - 5540.32] P:1832.84 E:0.105957 |  Ladies from Sheppield United, Millwall, Tom Gale.
[5540.32 - 5542.32] P:1624.56 E:0.117508 |  Sheppield United Nail, Millwall, Warmer.
[5542.32 - 5544.32] P:1717.10 E:0.104889 |  In the 90th minute, visitors have vantage.
[5544.32 - 5547.32] P:1701.36 E:0.112786 |  Almost doubled by an own goal from Michael Cooper.
[5547.32 - 5550.32] P:1744.16 E:0.109803 |  The bladeskeeper has passed inches wide in the post.
[5550.32 - 5552.32] P:1708.99 E:0.118932 |  Sheppield United Nail, Millwall, Wines.
[5552.32 - 5556.32] P:1918.04 E:0.115240 |  And we can check in on this morning's leaders, Burnley with Leed Blakeman at Derby.
[5556.32 - 5559.32] P:1941.00 E:0.111556 |  Derby Nail, Burnley Nail, but Derby have just nearly won it.
[5559.32 - 5562.32] P:1908.28 E:0.106332 |  Ball across the face of goal, Clark with a header,
[5562.32 - 5566.32] P:1889.42 E:0.097872 |  wide from 3 yards into 8 minutes about in time.
[5566.32 - 5568.32] P:1882.47 E:0.090365 |  Derby Nail, Burnley Nail.
[5568.32 - 5571.32] P:1894.84 E:0.114634 |  And are Birmingham on course to the championship? Nathan Elman.
[5571.32 - 5575.32] P:1749.18 E:0.106046 |  Very much on course here, and someone somewhere preparing the fizz, no doubt.
[5575.32 - 5580.32] P:1801.85 E:0.101851 |  Still Peterborough 1, Birmingham 2, Birmingham if anything, looking for more goals.
[5580.32 - 5582.32] P:1909.48 E:0.092027 |  Peterborough 1, Birmingham 2 into stoppage time.
[5582.32 - 5585.32] P:1870.22 E:0.107126 |  And could Wickham get a valuable 3 points on the road?
[5585.32 - 5587.32] P:1859.41 E:0.075204 |  Nikesh Raghane.
[5587.32 - 5590.32] P:1791.97 E:0.121376 |  Well it's still Huddersfield, Nail, Wickham 1, we're into the last minute here.
[5590.32 - 5594.32] P:1845.49 E:0.107837 |  Wickham looking to go within 3 points of second place, Wrexham.
[5594.32 - 5597.32] P:1795.55 E:0.111180 |  That goal from Daniel Udo, the difference. Huddersfield, Nail, Wickham 1.
[5597.32 - 5600.32] P:1896.38 E:0.096953 |  Trossard has come on to replace Bukai Osaka.
[5600.32 - 5602.32] P:1871.22 E:0.090646 |  16 minutes remain.
[5602.32 - 5605.32] P:1770.22 E:0.095582 |  It's been a monumental night in North London.
[5605.32 - 5609.32] P:1860.19 E:0.106559 |  And Arsenal are leading Real Madrid by 2 goals to Nail.
[5609.32 - 5617.32] P:1948.38 E:0.104523 |  They have only lost the first leg in one of their last 14 Champions League quarter-finals.
[5617.32 - 5621.32] P:1959.27 E:0.110045 |  Have Real Madrid. That was against Walsberg in 2016.
[5621.32 - 5624.32] P:1927.75 E:0.106722 |  They lost the away leg to Nail.
[5624.32 - 5628.32] P:1873.44 E:0.107675 |  They won the return 3-0 and went on to win the final.
[5628.32 - 5635.32] P:1858.66 E:0.110069 |  As Bukai Osaka not walking freely is hobbling his way towards the tunnel area.
[5635.32 - 5639.32] P:1926.11 E:0.104099 |  But Rice on a hat trick, storms forward, out towards Trossard.
[5639.32 - 5643.32] P:1830.44 E:0.097317 |  Trossard left side, back towards Lewis Skelly.
[5643.32 - 5645.32] P:1788.18 E:0.124046 |  Hit by Marino!
[5645.32 - 5648.32] P:1753.83 E:0.124599 |  Bukai Marino!
[5648.32 - 5651.32] P:1690.36 E:0.125117 |  Galerium inside the end-wrestling!
[5652.32 - 5655.32] P:1808.81 E:0.121804 |  First time! Left but in effort!
[5655.32 - 5657.32] P:1774.88 E:0.118245 |  Spice the bottom, left-hand corner!
[5657.32 - 5663.32] P:1853.14 E:0.118544 |  The European Champions are really Real Madrid at 3-0 down.
[5663.32 - 5669.32] P:1855.29 E:0.111350 |  And Arsenal now have more than a healthy cushion to take this Spanish capital.
[5669.32 - 5673.32] P:1764.95 E:0.101218 |  Wow! This place is going off.
[5673.32 - 5677.32] P:1762.98 E:0.115121 |  It really is. Supporters around us cannot believe it.
[5677.32 - 5680.32] P:1722.68 E:0.119787 |  I don't think Real Madrid can believe it.
[5680.32 - 5683.32] P:1779.29 E:0.119168 |  There is a swagger in Arsenal's play.
[5683.32 - 5686.32] P:1786.67 E:0.115972 |  I was just watching the game and I was thinking,
[5686.32 - 5690.32] P:1796.26 E:0.115145 |  there's just an unbelievable feel around what Arsenal were doing at the moment.
[5690.32 - 5695.32] P:1783.85 E:0.111101 |  Just the rhythm they're in, the way Declareis drove forwards with the ball
[5695.32 - 5697.32] P:1843.04 E:0.110978 |  to create the situation.
[5697.32 - 5701.32] P:1709.25 E:0.107902 |  I mean, he has been immense in this second half of the game.
[5701.32 - 5704.32] P:1830.60 E:0.102410 |  Drives in, draws three players towards him,
[5704.32 - 5709.32] P:1825.13 E:0.099336 |  offloads the ball into Marino from the cross.
[5709.32 - 5712.32] P:1724.26 E:0.107913 |  And the way he hits it, I mean, we've been complaining
[5712.32 - 5715.32] P:1812.60 E:0.104575 |  that Arsenal haven't had a centre-forward on the pitch.
[5715.32 - 5718.32] P:1725.24 E:0.111187 |  Well, any centre-forward in World Football
[5718.32 - 5720.32] P:1799.46 E:0.104465 |  will be happy with that left-foot finish.
[5720.32 - 5722.32] P:1715.89 E:0.117153 |  You have to say, it is fizzing across the turn.
[5722.32 - 5725.32] P:1772.88 E:0.108073 |  He's under pressure from Rudiger with his left foot.
[5725.32 - 5728.32] P:1752.13 E:0.098498 |  He just guides that ball. Bang!
[5728.32 - 5731.32] P:1774.69 E:0.105439 |  First time into the bottom corner.
[5731.32 - 5733.32] P:1932.09 E:0.096522 |  Courtois absolutely no chance.
[5733.32 - 5738.32] P:1863.82 E:0.099809 |  Arsenal, the rhythm they're in at the moment and the confidence is sky-high.
[5739.32 - 5742.32] P:1845.10 E:0.107950 |  Arsenal, three.
[5742.32 - 5746.32] P:1817.95 E:0.096511 |  Real Madrid, nil, 14 minutes remaining.
[5746.32 - 5749.32] P:1817.44 E:0.098439 |  They're making a mockery of the Supercomputer.
[5749.32 - 5752.32] P:1882.13 E:0.094093 |  The Supercomputer said it would only be marginal.
[5752.32 - 5755.32] P:1836.72 E:0.106367 |  Yeah, I mean, that's what the Deno computer said as well,
[5755.32 - 5758.32] P:1815.12 E:0.089442 |  making a mockery of that, which is even more astounding.
[5758.32 - 5762.32] P:1882.15 E:0.110651 |  Cardiff City have got an equaliser at Preston Northland, it's 2-2.
[5762.32 - 5765.32] P:1915.91 E:0.106415 |  Luton Town have got an injury time equaliser at Stoke.
[5765.32 - 5768.32] P:1848.43 E:0.103080 |  Stoke 1, Luton 1. It's finished. Norwich nil, Sunderland nil.
[5768.32 - 5775.32] P:1786.43 E:0.104992 |  Sunderland 4. But Arsenal here, 3-0 up against Real Madrid.
[5775.32 - 5778.32] P:1811.05 E:0.119207 |  Are you totting them in disguise?
[5778.32 - 5781.32] P:1799.25 E:0.108117 |  Is the champ from the Arsenal supporters?
[5781.32 - 5786.32] P:1864.62 E:0.116502 |  Here is Trossard. The way that Arsenal are playing though, they fancy another one.
[5786.32 - 5790.32] P:1845.44 E:0.093918 |  They do, and it feels enough to say the way that Real Madrid are playing,
[5790.32 - 5794.32] P:1823.72 E:0.106411 |  you fancy that's a possibility. They've just collapsed in this second half.
[5794.32 - 5797.32] P:1803.36 E:0.083528 |  They cannot get to grips with this game whatsoever.
[5797.32 - 5801.32] P:1785.02 E:0.092860 |  I mean, I'm taking nothing away from Declan Rice's free kicks,
[5801.32 - 5804.32] P:1847.68 E:0.095723 |  but there was something about the set-up of that second one,
[5804.32 - 5807.32] P:1729.72 E:0.107367 |  it just didn't look right to me. It was just too easy for...
[5807.32 - 5810.32] P:1823.96 E:0.107710 |  I mean, whether or not there had been any wall or any goal kick,
[5810.32 - 5813.32] P:1552.94 E:0.102287 |  we could have saved that free kick, it was just unbelievable from Declan.
[5813.32 - 5817.32] P:1678.71 E:0.094699 |  But it just hasn't felt well put together, team,
[5817.32 - 5820.32] P:1740.25 E:0.097607 |  that Real Madrid have put out here in the second half.
[5820.32 - 5823.32] P:1976.94 E:0.115100 |  Now, Venetius Junio latches onto a ball on that left-hand side.
[5823.32 - 5826.32] P:1919.48 E:0.104518 |  Venetius Junio cuts into the penalty area, edge of the area,
[5826.32 - 5829.32] P:1832.17 E:0.095174 |  and that long goal, and Bapé scoops it up in the air.
[5829.32 - 5831.32] P:1747.68 E:0.122957 |  But there, back with Erdogan,
[5831.32 - 5835.32] P:1800.99 E:0.119795 |  and Erdogan was being pulled back by Bellingham free kick to Arsenal.
[5835.32 - 5837.32] P:1815.26 E:0.114450 |  As we go to Peterborough and Nathan Alvin.
[5837.32 - 5840.32] P:1760.93 E:0.102921 |  The away end is bouncing, you can bang out the bubbly,
[5840.32 - 5843.32] P:1908.37 E:0.092413 |  Birmingham are championship-bound, six games left,
[5843.32 - 5845.32] P:1858.00 E:0.090978 |  but the promotion party can begin.
[5845.32 - 5848.32] P:1858.59 E:0.092548 |  Two-one winners here at Peterborough, back in the second tier.
[5848.32 - 5851.32] P:1816.56 E:0.095839 |  The first time of asking, Peterborough won, Birmingham two.
[5851.32 - 5855.32] P:1857.25 E:0.098946 |  And those two sides actually play each other at the weekend in the EFL.
[5855.32 - 5859.32] P:1858.14 E:0.104152 |  Trophy final where Birmingham will be back by somewhere in the region
[5859.32 - 5861.32] P:1972.25 E:0.100234 |  of 43,000 fans at Wembley.
[5861.32 - 5866.32] P:1914.03 E:0.101254 |  And Bristol City have got an injury-time winner, I would suspect,
[5866.32 - 5868.32] P:2001.04 E:0.092721 |  at Ashton Gate in the championship.
[5868.32 - 5873.32] P:1804.77 E:0.106726 |  Bristol City two, West Bromwich Albion one is a ladies' score.
[5873.32 - 5878.32] P:1704.78 E:0.090691 |  As here, Real Madrid are going to make another change.
[5878.32 - 5881.32] P:1796.26 E:0.089966 |  Fran Garcia is going to be coming on,
[5881.32 - 5885.32] P:1762.01 E:0.098544 |  and David Alibar unable to continue at left-back.
[5885.32 - 5889.32] P:1693.35 E:0.104597 |  So this 25-year-old defender who's been at the club for 10 years,
[5889.32 - 5895.32] P:1693.20 E:0.091894 |  he's come up through the academy, coming on at left-back.
[5895.32 - 5900.32] P:1737.67 E:0.098661 |  I mean, from Real Madrid's perspective, you're looking at the clock,
[5900.32 - 5904.32] P:1762.89 E:0.097281 |  you're thinking what, we've got 15 minutes left of this game, roughly,
[5904.32 - 5908.32] P:1781.84 E:0.103327 |  12 minutes and then three, four, five minutes of injury time.
[5908.32 - 5913.32] P:1827.89 E:0.100524 |  Can we get a goal just to bring ourselves back in this tie
[5913.32 - 5916.32] P:1943.98 E:0.109294 |  to a two-goal deficit and bring it home?
[5916.32 - 5920.32] P:1964.00 E:0.112056 |  Because, you know, they've been absolutely played off the park
[5920.32 - 5922.32] P:1915.48 E:0.119638 |  in the second half.
[5922.32 - 5926.32] P:1876.85 E:0.118293 |  Declan Rice is coming off, and he is getting a standing ovation.
[5926.32 - 5932.32] P:1883.29 E:0.114982 |  And no wonder, because his two-three kicks will be shown time and time
[5932.32 - 5937.32] P:1884.62 E:0.109544 |  and time again, but his general performance, he has been marvellous.
[5937.32 - 5942.32] P:1895.75 E:0.108527 |  against Real Madrid as Kieran Tierney comes on to replace
[5942.32 - 5944.32] P:1867.30 E:0.084844 |  the England international.
[5944.32 - 5947.32] P:1895.27 E:0.089858 |  Full-time at Huddersfield, Nick Kessler-Garney.
[5947.32 - 5950.32] P:1906.64 E:0.097767 |  Where he's finished, Huddersfield, nil, Wickham one,
[5950.32 - 5953.32] P:1950.76 E:0.110449 |  Daniel Udo's goal, enough to earn Wickham a first win in three.
[5953.32 - 5956.32] P:1758.54 E:0.100699 |  Both sides had their chances in the second half,
[5956.32 - 5959.32] P:1762.07 E:0.105991 |  but Mike Dodd's side holding on to go within three points of Wrexham
[5959.32 - 5962.32] P:1812.37 E:0.101910 |  in second place. Huddersfield, nil, Wickham one.
[5962.32 - 5965.32] P:1775.65 E:0.099721 |  Wickham three points then behind Wrexham, that was their game in hand.
[5965.32 - 5969.32] P:1831.81 E:0.103220 |  Arsenal are leading by three goals to nil, and we've got ten minutes to go
[5969.32 - 5971.32] P:1984.74 E:0.099148 |  of normal time.
[5971.32 - 5974.32] P:1904.38 E:0.098569 |  Interesting changes, I mean, just to give a feel of the team,
[5974.32 - 5977.32] P:1869.98 E:0.098899 |  I mean, Trossard came on, went on the left-hand side,
[5977.32 - 5982.32] P:1863.58 E:0.109284 |  Martinelli went over to Saka's position, and now Tierney's come on
[5982.32 - 5984.32] P:1822.95 E:0.104620 |  to the pitch on the left-hand side.
[5984.32 - 5986.32] P:1889.94 E:0.120064 |  I think Lewis Skelly has just gone into midfield,
[5986.32 - 5989.32] P:1894.83 E:0.112205 |  has in the position of Declan Rice,
[5989.32 - 5992.32] P:1876.48 E:0.115941 |  he's got a midfield three now with Parti, Oda Gard,
[5992.32 - 5995.32] P:1845.12 E:0.106460 |  and Lewis Skelly with Tierney in the left-back position.
[5995.32 - 5999.32] P:1788.51 E:0.112784 |  Lewis Skelly with a throw, Tierney will keep it down by the corner flag,
[5999.32 - 6003.32] P:1805.90 E:0.101264 |  all about now managing these next ten, nine minutes or whatever it is,
[6003.32 - 6007.32] P:1872.18 E:0.096965 |  remaining nine and a half for Arsenal leading by three goals to nil.
[6007.32 - 6010.32] P:1897.85 E:0.106321 |  Sheffield added Millwall in the championship, Tom Gale.
[6010.32 - 6012.32] P:1871.92 E:0.109415 |  Full time, Sheffield united nil, Millwall one,
[6012.32 - 6015.32] P:1845.24 E:0.099251 |  Booze on the whistle, back-to-back the feats as the blades drop to third,
[6015.32 - 6019.32] P:1864.82 E:0.102585 |  Coburn's twenty-first-minute winner moves Millwall to win three points
[6019.32 - 6023.32] P:1766.54 E:0.106560 |  to the playoffs, full time, Sheffield united nil, Millwall one.
[6023.32 - 6025.32] P:1873.06 E:0.098741 |  And full time at Derby, Lee Blateman.
[6025.32 - 6027.32] P:1667.71 E:0.093438 |  Nil-nil, the draw fair on the balance of things,
[6027.32 - 6029.32] P:1703.91 E:0.109411 |  Clark could have won it at the end for Derby,
[6029.32 - 6031.32] P:1674.37 E:0.106919 |  Fleming had Burnley's best two chances,
[6031.32 - 6033.32] P:1655.11 E:0.105092 |  but it's ended Derby nil, Burnley nil.
[6033.32 - 6036.32] P:1904.28 E:0.101198 |  So this is how the top of the championship looks with five games left to play.
[6036.32 - 6039.32] P:1861.81 E:0.090064 |  Leeds united back-top, eighty-five points,
[6039.32 - 6043.32] P:1865.93 E:0.093681 |  Burnley eighty-five points, Leeds have a superior goal difference,
[6043.32 - 6047.32] P:1810.45 E:0.090459 |  and they are two points clear of Sheffield united.
[6047.32 - 6050.32] P:1825.87 E:0.094476 |  And the Netherlands are back in fourth on seventy-six,
[6050.32 - 6055.32] P:1628.22 E:0.091628 |  and then Bristol City, Middlesbrough, commentary, West Brom, Millwall,
[6055.32 - 6060.32] P:1809.10 E:0.088642 |  and maybe even Watford are all scrapping four playoff places.
[6060.32 - 6065.32] P:1778.57 E:0.083735 |  But what a night it has been here in North London, eight minutes remain.
[6065.32 - 6068.32] P:1761.41 E:0.111550 |  I mean, how must Michael Arter be feeling as well?
[6068.32 - 6071.32] P:1857.17 E:0.097903 |  What an evening it is for him pitching himself
[6071.32 - 6074.32] P:1843.84 E:0.096056 |  against the most decorated coach,
[6074.32 - 6076.32] P:1915.35 E:0.100527 |  the most decorated coaches in world football.
[6076.32 - 6079.32] P:1905.82 E:0.096636 |  And how Arter will play, they've set up really well.
[6079.32 - 6082.32] P:1870.13 E:0.064902 |  Game plan's been good to score three goals,
[6082.32 - 6085.32] P:1838.70 E:0.093467 |  it's beyond their dreams really.
[6085.32 - 6088.32] P:1848.48 E:0.109481 |  Rodrigo comes forward, Tienik goes to the ground,
[6088.32 - 6091.32] P:1845.99 E:0.120982 |  he was being pulled back by Rodrigo.
[6093.32 - 6096.32] P:1954.04 E:0.110734 |  The win for Arsenal is secure,
[6096.32 - 6098.32] P:1904.98 E:0.112801 |  eight minutes to go, leading three-nil.
[6098.32 - 6102.32] P:1838.14 E:0.089684 |  However, in the dynamic, the wider picture of the tie,
[6102.32 - 6106.32] P:1790.50 E:0.095079 |  a goal for Real Madrid, it is imperative now that Arsenal keep the clean sheet.
[6106.32 - 6107.32] P:1843.88 E:0.096173 |  Agreed.
[6107.32 - 6112.32] P:1833.83 E:0.093803 |  And all Madrid will be looking for is can we just reduce this deficit by one?
[6112.32 - 6115.32] P:1699.55 E:0.101955 |  The game's over in terms of Arsenal going to win it, you'd feel,
[6115.32 - 6118.32] P:1683.21 E:0.098101 |  unless there's an unbelievable collapse.
[6118.32 - 6120.32] P:1787.56 E:0.097754 |  And that doesn't feel like it in the game,
[6120.32 - 6122.32] P:1702.82 E:0.089558 |  and I think that's the problem for Real Madrid.
[6122.32 - 6128.32] P:1781.61 E:0.089327 |  At the moment Arsenal, they're not showing any creaks or cracks in what they're doing.
[6128.32 - 6130.32] P:1843.24 E:0.116632 |  They're actually being very solid.
[6130.32 - 6135.32] P:1738.98 E:0.100325 |  I mean, you've mentioned Kibbe all once, but he has been brilliant tonight.
[6135.32 - 6139.32] P:1698.80 E:0.110333 |  Now, Lewis Skelly and Bellingham have just got into a bit of a tangle.
[6139.32 - 6142.32] P:1819.87 E:0.113729 |  Erdogan comes forward, passes the ball to Martinelli now on the right,
[6142.32 - 6147.32] P:1780.62 E:0.116877 |  his cross takes a deflection and goes out of play for a corner kick.
[6149.32 - 6154.32] P:1748.41 E:0.108698 |  Bellingham and Lewis Skelly, I've got to say, I like that about Lewis Skelly.
[6154.32 - 6156.32] P:1833.78 E:0.105647 |  He's not over-awed.
[6156.32 - 6160.32] P:1838.27 E:0.094704 |  No. And neither should he be. Drew Bellingham not happy.
[6160.32 - 6164.32] P:1791.72 E:0.098560 |  And he's having a little word with him now as he's walking over,
[6164.32 - 6166.32] P:1821.32 E:0.100087 |  he's chatting to the referee.
[6166.32 - 6171.32] P:1907.96 E:0.098078 |  I mean, I didn't see Martinelli, they're both on the floor, they're trying to get up.
[6171.32 - 6175.32] P:1876.33 E:0.108382 |  Lewis Skelly doesn't put any real pressure on his car.
[6175.32 - 6179.32] P:1878.77 E:0.109666 |  I think Drew Bellingham's looking for something there from the referee
[6179.32 - 6182.32] P:1810.42 E:0.102731 |  that just isn't there at all.
[6183.32 - 6188.32] P:1759.92 E:0.098686 |  Arsenal, 3-0 up, corner kick, far side the right.
[6188.32 - 6192.32] P:1744.00 E:0.088111 |  A fourth, here would take them into dreamland.
[6192.32 - 6196.32] P:1674.01 E:0.075166 |  Far side the right, Erdogan to take it.
[6196.32 - 6201.32] P:1732.58 E:0.093573 |  In-swinger, punched away by Courtois, Trossard lifts it up in the air,
[6201.32 - 6204.32] P:1687.46 E:0.100682 |  Noct, and then Rodrigo is caught, never be a free kick.
[6204.32 - 6207.32] P:1819.13 E:0.110078 |  Another goal on the other Champions League quarter-final, Masferuki.
[6207.32 - 6210.32] P:1547.06 E:0.092947 |  Well, last week it was announced he's leaving at the end of the season
[6210.32 - 6213.32] P:1484.82 E:0.105294 |  and he's been in the game for 25 years at Bayern,
[6213.32 - 6217.32] P:1481.02 E:0.103052 |  but Thomas Müller's got the equaliser with five minutes plus stoppage time to go.
[6217.32 - 6219.32] P:1481.33 E:0.099082 |  Bayern won into one.
[6219.32 - 6221.32] P:1661.56 E:0.117814 |  So, level there in Germany,
[6221.32 - 6227.32] P:1507.55 E:0.108008 |  so that's where the final will be held on Saturday 31st of May,
[6227.32 - 6230.32] P:1716.15 E:0.084560 |  as Rodrigo has come off,
[6230.32 - 6234.32] P:1646.56 E:0.083727 |  and coming on is Brahim Dias,
[6234.32 - 6238.32] P:1671.46 E:0.094413 |  the former Manchester City player.
[6238.32 - 6241.32] P:1657.48 E:0.098877 |  He had a good time at the Etihad,
[6241.32 - 6246.32] P:1575.08 E:0.088611 |  had those three seasons on loan at Milan.
[6246.32 - 6250.32] P:1762.18 E:0.116458 |  12 goals last season was his actual best-scoring return,
[6250.32 - 6254.32] P:1578.27 E:0.110444 |  but he struggled this time, so Brahim Dias comes on.
[6254.32 - 6261.32] P:1607.45 E:0.103167 |  Arsenal are 3-0 up, five minutes remaining.
[6261.32 - 6264.32] P:1696.79 E:0.095333 |  Stunning, stunning night for the Gunners.
[6264.32 - 6267.32] P:1620.71 E:0.108782 |  You'd say the game is more about how well Arsenal have done
[6267.32 - 6270.32] P:1558.83 E:0.106193 |  as opposed to Madrid being poor.
[6270.32 - 6272.32] P:1692.52 E:0.102357 |  Rear being poor, you'd have to say.
[6272.32 - 6274.32] P:1552.74 E:0.091113 |  It's been a little bit of a combination.
[6274.32 - 6277.32] P:1612.61 E:0.110659 |  The both of them started pretty well
[6277.32 - 6279.32] P:1684.72 E:0.099318 |  and showed their teeth on a few occasions,
[6279.32 - 6284.32] P:1824.92 E:0.092689 |  but Arsenal, in the second half, have just blown them away.
[6284.32 - 6286.32] P:1804.67 E:0.090389 |  They've bossed the second half, haven't they?
[6286.32 - 6288.32] P:1849.64 E:0.100909 |  Absolutely bossed it.
[6288.32 - 6291.32] P:1743.91 E:0.111566 |  Agreed physically with intensity on the ball
[6291.32 - 6294.32] P:1824.22 E:0.093634 |  and have come up with those moments we were talking about
[6294.32 - 6296.32] P:1852.05 E:0.089854 |  in the first half, but we're just lacking.
[6296.32 - 6299.32] P:1782.89 E:0.082636 |  They've just produced them in the second half
[6299.32 - 6301.32] P:1677.68 E:0.091922 |  and he's put himself in a brilliant position.
[6301.32 - 6307.32] P:1765.88 E:0.089988 |  Just been shown a tweet on the match of the day feed, actually.
[6307.32 - 6312.32] P:1788.64 E:0.098897 |  He hadn't... Detlan Rice hadn't scored any direct free-kicks goals
[6312.32 - 6318.32] P:1819.82 E:0.104402 |  in any of his previous 338 games for both West Ham and Arsenal,
[6318.32 - 6322.32] P:1801.59 E:0.098350 |  and he's hit two worldy free-kicks in the Champions League.
[6322.32 - 6324.32] P:1777.55 E:0.086340 |  What do they say about buses?
[6324.32 - 6325.32] P:1784.41 E:0.089577 |  Yeah.
[6325.32 - 6327.32] P:1734.49 E:0.108084 |  It's true to form, isn't it?
[6327.32 - 6329.32] P:1739.95 E:0.077231 |  Oh, just a bit.
[6329.32 - 6332.32] P:1749.83 E:0.112993 |  He'll be dreaming of those two goals again.
[6332.32 - 6334.32] P:1792.02 E:0.093449 |  I mean, he couldn't have hit them any better.
[6334.32 - 6336.32] P:1848.43 E:0.081178 |  It's phenomenal stuff.
[6336.32 - 6339.32] P:1755.10 E:0.092182 |  It's Roy the Rovers' stuff, isn't it?
[6339.32 - 6342.32] P:1835.31 E:0.103659 |  Those kind of free-kicks from that area,
[6342.32 - 6344.32] P:1789.28 E:0.098780 |  the first one amazing everywhere.
[6344.32 - 6346.32] P:1594.67 E:0.092425 |  Wow, you know, but then to step up.
[6346.32 - 6348.32] P:1796.90 E:0.102020 |  I mean, it was barely any time between the two.
[6348.32 - 6350.32] P:1731.75 E:0.102139 |  It wasn't long at all, was there?
[6350.32 - 6352.32] P:1745.06 E:0.098755 |  Between the two free-kicks.
[6352.32 - 6355.32] P:1803.75 E:0.089943 |  And to step up and produce the same thing.
[6355.32 - 6357.32] P:1748.01 E:0.100227 |  The second one, he was totally relaxed.
[6357.32 - 6360.32] P:1676.71 E:0.088269 |  I saw the way that he addressed the ball.
[6360.32 - 6362.32] P:1737.49 E:0.096521 |  It was just like, you know,
[6362.32 - 6365.32] P:1838.64 E:0.113772 |  on his toes, his body language was good and just bang.
[6365.32 - 6367.32] P:1911.46 E:0.111992 |  Brilliant hit for him.
[6367.32 - 6369.32] P:1829.88 E:0.113308 |  Party back to Kevior.
[6369.32 - 6371.32] P:1787.27 E:0.122970 |  O'Rea has to get this away first time.
[6371.32 - 6374.32] P:1717.21 E:0.111921 |  Another example of how well Party's played in the midfield.
[6374.32 - 6377.32] P:1731.64 E:0.103333 |  Now is away, and Scamp is clear on this near side.
[6377.32 - 6380.32] P:1767.39 E:0.100088 |  Midway through the round, Madrid half, leading by three goals to nil.
[6380.32 - 6382.32] P:1724.68 E:0.102308 |  Three minutes of normal time remaining.
[6382.32 - 6384.32] P:1663.04 E:0.076308 |  Lewis Skelling.
[6384.32 - 6387.32] P:1830.45 E:0.109201 |  Arsenal supporters are still embracing themselves around us here.
[6387.32 - 6391.32] P:1692.39 E:0.107448 |  It's one of those nights where they will just replay in their head
[6391.32 - 6393.32] P:1564.99 E:0.106242 |  and then mine and time and time again.
[6393.32 - 6395.32] P:1511.99 E:0.112946 |  Here is Zetrossa.
[6395.32 - 6397.32] P:1593.01 E:0.115694 |  Marina looks to go on ahead of it.
[6397.32 - 6399.32] P:1704.62 E:0.105687 |  Erdogan with a little flick, almost came off.
[6399.32 - 6401.32] P:1747.30 E:0.114635 |  Another goal in Munich, that's Verukic.
[6401.32 - 6404.32] P:1598.85 E:0.106032 |  But it looks like they've thrown it away right at the end.
[6404.32 - 6407.32] P:1482.64 E:0.110195 |  Sub-to-Tuit for a test, he's bundling in for Inter on the counterattack.
[6407.32 - 6409.32] P:1483.04 E:0.102003 |  Couple of minutes left to go in this one.
[6409.32 - 6411.32] P:1156.35 E:0.101815 |  Bind one, Inter two.
[6412.32 - 6414.32] P:1688.73 E:0.088687 |  Thank you, Maus.
[6414.32 - 6419.32] P:1699.18 E:0.098921 |  We have got two and a half minutes of normal time remaining.
[6419.32 - 6423.32] P:1846.45 E:0.099260 |  12 minutes, those two free kicks were apart by now.
[6423.32 - 6426.32] P:1784.68 E:0.083063 |  So to step up 12 minutes later and go,
[6426.32 - 6428.32] P:1762.23 E:0.096978 |  yep, I'll have this one again.
[6428.32 - 6430.32] P:1686.64 E:0.092537 |  I mean, it makes sense he takes it again.
[6430.32 - 6433.32] P:1696.58 E:0.097401 |  You think he's just stuck one in the top corner.
[6433.32 - 6435.32] P:1657.16 E:0.082738 |  There you go, have another one.
[6435.32 - 6438.32] P:1732.47 E:0.115659 |  But to do it again at this level is pretty special.
[6438.32 - 6441.32] P:1790.89 E:0.100511 |  For any player, let alone a player that hasn't scored a free, direct free kick in,
[6441.32 - 6443.32] P:1636.91 E:0.091239 |  how many games is it, 300 and...
[6443.32 - 6445.32] P:1666.34 E:0.105109 |  38. 38, there you go.
[6446.32 - 6448.32] P:1783.62 E:0.092957 |  Two absolute gems.
[6449.32 - 6453.32] P:1706.74 E:0.107711 |  Again, Lewis Scali just using...
[6453.32 - 6458.32] P:1650.09 E:0.107836 |  At times he's beyond his years, because there was a free kick,
[6458.32 - 6461.32] P:1769.04 E:0.100407 |  sorry, a throw in, he's got an option to take it quickly.
[6461.32 - 6464.32] P:1757.07 E:0.093943 |  Brahim, he has offers in the ball, he doesn't take it.
[6464.32 - 6467.32] P:1792.75 E:0.098989 |  He goes down, collects another one off on a small little white cut,
[6467.32 - 6469.32] P:1859.36 E:0.090285 |  just to eat at the valuable seconds.
[6469.32 - 6472.32] P:1638.63 E:0.096970 |  I mean, just how he handled the Drew Bellingham thing there,
[6472.32 - 6475.32] P:1806.90 E:0.099646 |  he tried to get him in a little bit of trouble, he gets up,
[6475.32 - 6477.32] P:1866.22 E:0.120799 |  doesn't lose his cool, but he's got an air about it
[6477.32 - 6480.32] P:1851.56 E:0.102606 |  and a body language about it, as if to say,
[6480.32 - 6484.32] P:1834.47 E:0.099396 |  I don't care about you, I know what my job is,
[6484.32 - 6486.32] P:1737.93 E:0.094926 |  I'm doing my thing and I'm doing it well.
[6486.32 - 6488.32] P:1854.46 E:0.092543 |  And he kind of carries that on the pitch,
[6488.32 - 6491.32] P:1739.92 E:0.098026 |  you know, it's a really good characteristic he has.
[6492.32 - 6496.32] P:1823.97 E:0.094643 |  This would be the perfect performance,
[6496.32 - 6501.32] P:1937.46 E:0.103046 |  the perfect score line to get three goals and a clean sheet,
[6503.32 - 6509.32] P:1734.12 E:0.086721 |  not allowing Real Madrid back into the game.
[6509.32 - 6512.32] P:1843.65 E:0.102050 |  So much pressure is going to be on the European champions,
[6512.32 - 6516.32] P:1791.58 E:0.111986 |  as Trossard goes on a weeby run, dropping back inside his own heart.
[6516.32 - 6521.32] P:1689.87 E:0.089806 |  Kibir, can't go back to Raya, clears it long,
[6521.32 - 6523.32] P:1758.06 E:0.114989 |  towards Tierney, Tierney will give chase,
[6523.32 - 6528.32] P:1771.96 E:0.106006 |  Asensia with a back pass towards Courtois, has to get rid of it clearly,
[6528.32 - 6530.32] P:1823.25 E:0.118930 |  Tierney's chasing it, harrying everything
[6530.32 - 6533.32] P:1869.13 E:0.114400 |  and getting a standing ovation as a result.
[6534.32 - 6537.32] P:1909.57 E:0.114630 |  Kieran Tierney, who's leaving the club in the summer,
[6537.32 - 6539.32] P:1782.01 E:0.110164 |  but still giving it absolutely everything,
[6539.32 - 6543.32] P:1766.15 E:0.099131 |  and now every Arsenal player as we enter the last 30 seconds.
[6543.32 - 6545.32] P:1842.88 E:0.089981 |  What a performance this has been.
[6547.32 - 6550.32] P:1784.41 E:0.118224 |  Marina couldn't get there, Kama Vinga breaks it up,
[6550.32 - 6554.32] P:1819.18 E:0.107486 |  Valverde now passes the ball out towards that far side,
[6554.32 - 6556.32] P:1854.72 E:0.099226 |  Fran Garcia will scamper away with pace.
[6558.32 - 6562.32] P:1867.71 E:0.113468 |  Vinicius Jr cuts inside, shot, takes a deflection,
[6562.32 - 6566.32] P:1785.94 E:0.119880 |  and caught by Raya and Raya, gathers it and then drops to his knees.
[6566.32 - 6570.32] P:1882.27 E:0.111803 |  Wow, I mean, at the moment Vinicius Jr comes inside
[6570.32 - 6572.32] P:1873.39 E:0.100315 |  to take that shot with his right foot,
[6572.32 - 6576.32] P:1651.39 E:0.112619 |  three Arsenal players flying towards him to get that block in.
[6576.32 - 6579.32] P:1776.30 E:0.104186 |  Timber gets the block in, but that is the hunger
[6579.32 - 6582.32] P:1802.73 E:0.095781 |  that Arsenal have played this game in, certainly the second half.
[6582.32 - 6586.32] P:1759.74 E:0.089805 |  The mentality has been stand out from Arsenal.
[6586.32 - 6588.32] P:1710.97 E:0.109190 |  It's what's driven the result for me.
[6589.32 - 6592.32] P:1768.76 E:0.108204 |  They said they wanted to create their own story.
[6593.32 - 6595.32] P:1725.86 E:0.107706 |  They've done that answer.
[6596.32 - 6601.32] P:1736.18 E:0.104518 |  Ben White's going to be coming on, and it's going to be for Timber,
[6601.32 - 6605.32] P:1854.38 E:0.101188 |  and Timber's actually going to lead the field of play on the other side.
[6605.32 - 6608.32] P:1837.02 E:0.108426 |  The other thing to note as well is that they had a number of players
[6608.32 - 6610.32] P:1905.93 E:0.099450 |  actually on yellow cards tonight.
[6610.32 - 6613.32] P:1884.92 E:0.104580 |  They've navigated that hurdle particularly well too.
[6614.32 - 6618.32] P:1860.44 E:0.107137 |  So Ben White, who played just over an hour against Everton
[6618.32 - 6620.32] P:1827.75 E:0.109735 |  at the weekend, will replace Timber.
[6620.32 - 6623.32] P:1716.75 E:0.105928 |  So the social control, 0-8-2-1.
[6624.32 - 6626.32] P:1728.00 E:0.123911 |  They've got Brentford here at the weekend.
[6626.32 - 6628.32] P:1794.10 E:0.113375 |  I would imagine that there'll be many changes for the visitor.
[6628.32 - 6629.32] P:1790.34 E:0.113148 |  Yeah.
[6629.32 - 6633.32] P:1951.12 E:0.099857 |  Thomas Frankside, because the priority is to keep those players fresh
[6633.32 - 6635.32] P:1805.81 E:0.102486 |  for the game at the Burnabout next week.
[6635.32 - 6637.32] P:1836.33 E:0.105460 |  It will. I mean, the only question mark for me is,
[6637.32 - 6640.32] P:1794.69 E:0.095267 |  is Saka didn't look that comfortable coming up.
[6640.32 - 6643.32] P:1815.47 E:0.090262 |  I mean, Saka does come off in quite a lot of games.
[6643.32 - 6646.32] P:1783.04 E:0.095271 |  The amount of kicks and bumps, just in the style and the fashion
[6646.32 - 6649.32] P:1634.63 E:0.099274 |  that he plays the game, he's always getting kicked up in the air
[6649.32 - 6651.32] P:1704.72 E:0.090569 |  and got ankle problems and knocks and bumps.
[6651.32 - 6653.32] P:1862.99 E:0.081106 |  But he didn't look particularly comfortable
[6653.32 - 6655.32] P:1905.64 E:0.094638 |  did he, coming off Saka.
[6655.32 - 6658.32] P:1773.13 E:0.104132 |  I think that would be the only thing that you'd have a little question mark over.
[6658.32 - 6663.32] P:1830.49 E:0.117794 |  But if they carry a three-goal lead, which it looks likely,
[6663.32 - 6666.32] P:1832.13 E:0.103326 |  what an opportunity to go and set your stall out
[6666.32 - 6669.32] P:1772.89 E:0.094456 |  and make yourself difficult to beat.
[6669.32 - 6673.32] P:1743.86 E:0.099234 |  I'm told that Thomas Frank has been here tonight watching too.
[6673.32 - 6677.32] P:1682.17 E:0.107642 |  But even now, there is no drop-off for that work ethic.
[6677.32 - 6680.32] P:1816.15 E:0.107743 |  The levels that Arsenal have played without the ball,
[6680.32 - 6684.32] P:1852.22 E:0.092494 |  they have chased, they've harried, they've hassled.
[6684.32 - 6687.32] P:1751.18 E:0.097424 |  They've been prepared to do the ugly side.
[6687.32 - 6691.32] P:1778.12 E:0.098949 |  And then they've produced two, well, three moments of quality.
[6691.32 - 6697.32] P:1904.71 E:0.093455 |  The two rice free kicks, but equally the marino first instinctive.
[6697.32 - 6701.32] P:1845.57 E:0.103723 |  I would say that's as good as the free kicks in terms of quality.
[6701.32 - 6704.32] P:1867.26 E:0.091442 |  I mean, to finish with you, on the left side,
[6704.32 - 6706.32] P:1936.63 E:0.097389 |  the ball was fired at him as well.
[6706.32 - 6709.32] P:1936.24 E:0.103124 |  He had loads of pace on it to control and deal with it.
[6709.32 - 6713.32] P:1930.00 E:0.106199 |  He just did it first time effortlessly.
[6713.32 - 6718.32] P:1850.01 E:0.109745 |  Tim McGeiths is standing ovation as he only now makes it way back to the dugout area here at the Emirates.
[6718.32 - 6720.32] P:1837.56 E:0.108415 |  He's listening to five live and BBC sounds.
[6720.32 - 6723.32] P:1837.28 E:0.106991 |  We're live tomorrow in Paris. We're live in Lyon on Thursday.
[6723.32 - 6727.32] P:1804.17 E:0.103445 |  We will be live next week in Madrid. Make no mistake about that.
[6727.32 - 6732.32] P:1828.16 E:0.092529 |  But in the four minutes of added on time, we've got 90 seconds remaining.
[6733.32 - 6739.32] P:1813.93 E:0.087819 |  And Arsenal have just not looked like conceding in this second half.
[6739.32 - 6742.32] P:1806.60 E:0.102641 |  They have played ever so well to a man.
[6744.32 - 6746.32] P:1846.49 E:0.124519 |  Here is Rudiger.
[6748.32 - 6751.32] P:1788.22 E:0.116147 |  Real Madrid know that one goal could still change the dynamic of the tie.
[6751.32 - 6754.32] P:1788.25 E:0.101484 |  They hit it long up towards Mbappe.
[6754.32 - 6756.32] P:1912.40 E:0.105003 |  Saliba goes towards Mbappe.
[6756.32 - 6759.32] P:1932.89 E:0.102800 |  Mbappe left-hand side, tries to cut inside, looks for a shooting opportunity.
[6759.32 - 6761.32] P:1910.37 E:0.101274 |  Can't get a sight of goal to Valverde.
[6761.32 - 6764.32] P:1961.88 E:0.106956 |  Closed down by Trossard. Right corner of the area now.
[6764.32 - 6767.32] P:1904.70 E:0.103188 |  Vasquez with a cross, headed away by Lewis Skelly.
[6767.32 - 6770.32] P:1897.70 E:0.113329 |  Help further away by Martinelli.
[6770.32 - 6772.32] P:1851.58 E:0.106460 |  40 seconds remain.
[6772.32 - 6775.32] P:1958.11 E:0.113405 |  Look at the watch on the left wrist of our Bosnian referee.
[6775.32 - 6778.32] P:2032.95 E:0.110441 |  Vinicius Jr. level the penalty area left-hand side.
[6778.32 - 6780.32] P:2000.09 E:0.101284 |  Mbappe wants to do it himself.
[6780.32 - 6784.32] P:1926.70 E:0.110217 |  Mbappe into the penalty area but loses his balance and goes to ground.
[6784.32 - 6788.32] P:1854.10 E:0.104319 |  Saliba stands tall, stands calm and composed.
[6788.32 - 6790.32] P:1976.64 E:0.110677 |  Passes the ball up towards Trossard.
[6790.32 - 6793.32] P:1726.61 E:0.118004 |  And there was a foul and then Camarvinga kicks the ball away.
[6793.32 - 6796.32] P:1726.86 E:0.119480 |  And Camarvinga will be suspended.
[6796.32 - 6799.32] P:1694.64 E:0.117758 |  Camarvinga, that's a yellow card.
[6799.32 - 6801.32] P:1717.82 E:0.126277 |  Oh, he's already been booked of course.
[6801.32 - 6803.32] P:1805.99 E:0.109914 |  And he's off.
[6804.32 - 6809.32] P:1783.97 E:0.116501 |  Real Madrid will see out the game with 10 men.
[6809.32 - 6812.32] P:1759.67 E:0.110095 |  He was already going to be suspended.
[6814.32 - 6817.32] P:1737.58 E:0.114386 |  But Camarvinga has been dismissed.
[6817.32 - 6820.32] P:1725.86 E:0.102701 |  And Real Madrid's misery is complete.
[6820.32 - 6824.32] P:1722.80 E:0.101458 |  Talk about lose your discipline.
[6824.32 - 6830.32] P:1756.67 E:0.098238 |  Right there is a prime example of that phrase, to be honest.
[6830.32 - 6835.32] P:1801.39 E:0.095912 |  I mean, Ancelotti looks the other way as he walks straight down the tunnel.
[6835.32 - 6838.32] P:1814.73 E:0.095119 |  Camarvinga, it's just a headloss moment.
[6838.32 - 6840.32] P:1833.82 E:0.105376 |  The game's over.
[6840.32 - 6842.32] P:1762.93 E:0.107989 |  It's frustrated that the foul was given.
[6842.32 - 6846.32] P:1808.86 E:0.106504 |  And he just toe-punts the ball out of play.
[6846.32 - 6848.32] P:1733.63 E:0.118355 |  Referee has nowhere to go with it really then,
[6848.32 - 6850.32] P:1786.22 E:0.115092 |  because he's got no option.
[6850.32 - 6852.32] P:1623.04 E:0.121557 |  And it's just a real lack of it.
[6852.32 - 6854.32] P:1659.23 E:0.112746 |  It's rounded off the evening from Madrid.
[6854.32 - 6856.32] P:1554.34 E:0.095280 |  It's certainly the second half.
[6856.32 - 6861.32] P:1685.10 E:0.104980 |  By my watch, we have passed the four minutes of added on time.
[6861.32 - 6865.32] P:1702.83 E:0.098140 |  Arsenal three, Real Madrid, nil.
[6865.32 - 6869.32] P:1762.77 E:0.107072 |  Not quite their heaviest defeat in European competition.
[6869.32 - 6874.32] P:1876.22 E:0.106695 |  They've lost four nil at Manchester City and Liverpool in recent years.
[6874.32 - 6877.32] P:1744.52 E:0.108782 |  However, they have been second best.
[6877.32 - 6883.32] P:1847.12 E:0.107886 |  And Arsenal go into the second leg in a commanding position.
[6883.32 - 6886.32] P:1942.30 E:0.121768 |  Three goals to nil, it's finished here, the Emirates.
[6886.32 - 6890.32] P:1916.67 E:0.101578 |  The perfect performance from Michel Arteta's side.
[6890.32 - 6892.32] P:1797.24 E:0.101253 |  That helps them.
[6892.32 - 6895.32] P:1810.83 E:0.105583 |  Well, a night to remember.
[6895.32 - 6899.32] P:1793.02 E:0.107128 |  Certainly for Arsenal fans, certainly for Declan Rice,
[6899.32 - 6903.32] P:1829.23 E:0.108174 |  who single-handedly made the difference in this game,
[6903.32 - 6906.32] P:1849.08 E:0.111484 |  because I think putting those two free kicks in
[6906.32 - 6911.32] P:1813.14 E:0.102719 |  gave the team the confidence and the belief and the swagger
[6911.32 - 6914.32] P:1920.15 E:0.112532 |  to go on and just demolish Real Madrid
[6914.32 - 6916.32] P:1797.57 E:0.106684 |  in this second half of Champions League football.
[6916.32 - 6919.32] P:1877.75 E:0.109440 |  What a game to watch, what a game to experience,
[6919.32 - 6923.32] P:1828.63 E:0.111444 |  and what a lead to take to the Bernabal next week.
[6923.32 - 6927.32] P:1756.96 E:0.112006 |  Arsenal in prime position here in this time.
[6927.32 - 6930.32] P:1931.10 E:0.107227 |  Arsenal absolutely superb,
[6930.32 - 6935.32] P:1894.55 E:0.116142 |  and the European champions have got so much work to do.
[6935.32 - 6940.32] P:1854.83 E:0.108147 |  It's finished here, Arsenal three, Real Madrid nil, Kelly.
[6940.32 - 6942.32] P:1897.34 E:0.108906 |  Dele, what's happening at the moment?
[6942.32 - 6944.32] P:1566.89 E:0.115244 |  Because it's a big win for Arsenal.
[6944.32 - 6947.32] P:1681.31 E:0.106922 |  It's a three-nil victory against the European champions,
[6947.32 - 6949.32] P:1411.24 E:0.125473 |  and they're in a perfect position
[6949.32 - 6952.32] P:1407.85 E:0.113646 |  as they head to the Bernabal next week,
[6952.32 - 6954.32] P:1616.28 E:0.120097 |  but they're still only halfway through it.
[6954.32 - 6957.32] P:1651.37 E:0.108169 |  They are, but they've got themselves probably at a scoreline
[6957.32 - 6960.32] P:1604.25 E:0.121800 |  that many Arsenal fans would only entrench about
[6960.32 - 6962.32] P:1768.46 E:0.123092 |  coming into this stadium tonight,
[6962.32 - 6967.32] P:1563.57 E:0.119722 |  as the Arsenal anthem, the angel, reverberates around the Emirates,
[6967.32 - 6971.32] P:1500.15 E:0.123821 |  the red and white scarves are held aloft.
[6971.32 - 6974.32] P:1488.80 E:0.116682 |  They say about the streets that are our own.
[6974.32 - 6976.32] P:1775.85 E:0.114567 |  This pitch here tonight was Arsenal's own
[6976.32 - 6979.32] P:1702.08 E:0.115329 |  because they absolutely bosted the second half.
[6979.32 - 6983.32] P:1617.35 E:0.114777 |  They didn't really give the European champions a sniff.
[6983.32 - 6987.32] P:1712.88 E:0.114125 |  Two beauty-free kicks from Declan Rice, absolute belters.
[6987.32 - 6991.32] P:1537.23 E:0.117214 |  And then Miquel Moreno with an instinctive left foot,
[6991.32 - 6993.32] P:1702.11 E:0.119494 |  and Evan is the bottom left-hand corner.
[6993.32 - 6995.32] P:1873.61 E:0.110881 |  Cannevinga sent off right at the end
[6995.32 - 6997.32] P:1914.54 E:0.109026 |  to compound the misery for Real Madrid.
[6997.32 - 7000.32] P:1952.32 E:0.108292 |  It's a dream scenario, Kelly, for Miquel Arsetta.
[7000.32 - 7004.32] P:1945.70 E:0.100712 |  No number nine, no problem, Matt Upson.
[7004.32 - 7007.32] P:1863.43 E:0.108715 |  I knew that was coming. I absolutely knew it.
[7007.32 - 7010.32] P:1854.45 E:0.104591 |  You kind of said in the comms that, you know,
[7010.32 - 7013.32] P:1880.80 E:0.108462 |  a lot of criticism for Arsenal without the number nine,
[7013.32 - 7016.32] P:1761.44 E:0.099501 |  but, wow, what a finish.
[7016.32 - 7019.32] P:1872.29 E:0.105074 |  What a finish from Moreno on the swivel.
[7019.32 - 7023.32] P:1926.46 E:0.109720 |  It was not easy either because the ball was trapping at some speed.
[7023.32 - 7025.32] P:1920.68 E:0.097301 |  They had a little kick-up off the turf.
[7025.32 - 7028.32] P:1896.02 E:0.105563 |  It just bounced a tiny bit towards him to control it.
[7028.32 - 7031.32] P:1935.83 E:0.109573 |  He's leaning backwards as well to control it
[7031.32 - 7033.32] P:1963.52 E:0.103776 |  and guide it into the far post.
[7033.32 - 7035.32] P:1875.84 E:0.099179 |  It was just a brilliant, brilliant finish.
[7035.32 - 7038.32] P:1882.83 E:0.101729 |  You know, technically, as good as the free kicks,
[7038.32 - 7041.32] P:1793.61 E:0.105187 |  but the free-kick moments were just star of the show.
[7041.32 - 7043.32] P:1751.04 E:0.103049 |  To step up and bang two in like that,
[7043.32 - 7045.32] P:1808.88 E:0.104368 |  that could rise to just incredible.
[7045.32 - 7048.32] P:1818.74 E:0.115682 |  I've got to say, Kelly, as well, I know Peter, the DJ here,
[7048.32 - 7051.32] P:1781.15 E:0.103917 |  at Arsenal, and he's now playing Rice Rice Babin.
[7051.32 - 7053.32] P:1812.03 E:0.116685 |  There's never a bad time for Van der Leis,
[7053.32 - 7055.32] P:1779.77 E:0.110827 |  but there probably couldn't be a better time for it
[7055.32 - 7058.32] P:1973.93 E:0.112251 |  for the Arsenal fans who are singing along at the Emirates.
[7058.32 - 7060.32] P:1809.05 E:0.121291 |  Matthew Upson and Ian Dennis are at the Emirates,
[7060.32 - 7061.32] P:1823.23 E:0.110011 |  taking it all in.
[7061.32 - 7064.32] P:1849.47 E:0.106533 |  Andros Townsend joins us as well.
[7064.32 - 7066.32] P:1991.14 E:0.089603 |  Andros, that second half of us,
[7066.32 - 7069.32] P:1891.26 E:0.096229 |  performers particularly from Arsenal,
[7069.32 - 7071.32] P:1856.69 E:0.102012 |  absolutely sealed the deal for them.
[7071.32 - 7073.32] P:1949.73 E:0.095114 |  What change do you think?
[7073.32 - 7076.32] P:1583.07 E:0.087052 |  I think the first goal, the first goal kind of
[7076.32 - 7078.32] P:1877.52 E:0.089411 |  allowed Arsenal to relax.
[7078.32 - 7080.32] P:1836.86 E:0.099636 |  They got the goal they needed.
[7080.32 - 7082.32] P:1700.75 E:0.092184 |  Second one followed soon after.
[7082.32 - 7085.32] P:1585.66 E:0.093106 |  When they got in a rhythm, they started counter-attacking Ramadriod.
[7085.32 - 7088.32] P:1659.24 E:0.091350 |  Ramadriod started throwing players forward in Arsenal,
[7088.32 - 7090.32] P:1691.69 E:0.084785 |  so I'd picked him off, and it was three-nil.
[7090.32 - 7092.32] P:1503.49 E:0.096194 |  It could have been a couple more in the end.
[7092.32 - 7094.32] P:1678.03 E:0.089936 |  But that second half, Ramadriod didn't really...
[7094.32 - 7097.32] P:1658.13 E:0.091134 |  I'm trying to think of a good chance of Ramadriod.
[7097.32 - 7100.32] P:1701.14 E:0.092144 |  I don't think there was any, if any, at all.
[7101.32 - 7103.32] P:1910.08 E:0.099419 |  Yeah, they absolutely crumbled Ramadriod.
[7103.32 - 7105.32] P:1706.25 E:0.109430 |  We should talk about the opposition,
[7105.32 - 7107.32] P:1853.66 E:0.093041 |  and Lodge, credit for that, has to go down
[7107.32 - 7111.32] P:1854.98 E:0.099149 |  to the way that Arsenal played the impact of the two free kicks,
[7111.32 - 7114.32] P:1705.59 E:0.096535 |  what, 12 minutes between them to give Arsenal that two-goal cushion,
[7114.32 - 7116.32] P:1827.83 E:0.104574 |  and then Marino adding to it.
[7116.32 - 7119.32] P:1742.60 E:0.090949 |  But Madrid just disappeared from the game.
[7119.32 - 7121.32] P:1762.52 E:0.075166 |  Yeah, they had a couple...
[7121.32 - 7124.32] P:1655.07 E:0.097358 |  I think back in the first half, they had a couple of good moments
[7124.32 - 7127.32] P:1547.56 E:0.094059 |  with Jude Bellingham in his position passing,
[7127.32 - 7130.32] P:1722.00 E:0.090778 |  but they didn't really make anything off it.
[7130.32 - 7134.32] P:1680.51 E:0.082919 |  And against Arsenal, if you don't sort of attack quick and score quick,
[7134.32 - 7138.32] P:1648.89 E:0.090250 |  they get men back so quickly that it's so difficult to score
[7138.32 - 7141.32] P:1651.64 E:0.093688 |  in that second phase, and Ramadriod will come in unstuck in that sense,
[7141.32 - 7143.32] P:1842.20 E:0.091850 |  and then they just stopped creating.
[7143.32 - 7145.32] P:1684.86 E:0.102879 |  They didn't really create anything,
[7145.32 - 7148.32] P:1745.94 E:0.089434 |  and it's quite comfortable for Arsenal in that second half in the end.
[7148.32 - 7151.32] P:2000.14 E:0.103437 |  And Matt Arsenal, almost there.
[7151.32 - 7154.32] P:1996.33 E:0.104348 |  They've got the return leg out of the Burnabout,
[7154.32 - 7156.32] P:1779.01 E:0.108214 |  but they've got a three-goal cushion now,
[7156.32 - 7160.32] P:1859.56 E:0.105247 |  and they might well be on their way to the semifinals of the Champions League.
[7160.32 - 7162.32] P:2007.68 E:0.091796 |  Yeah, no, absolutely.
[7162.32 - 7167.32] P:1770.31 E:0.101787 |  I mean, it's a tad too early to kind of be talking in that way for me.
[7167.32 - 7171.32] P:1784.65 E:0.109530 |  I mean, Ramadriod have been in situations probably nearly as dire
[7171.32 - 7174.32] P:1875.33 E:0.107859 |  or even worse than this before and managed to find a solution.
[7174.32 - 7179.32] P:1893.61 E:0.105146 |  So if there's any team at home that are going to turn this around,
[7179.32 - 7181.32] P:1926.23 E:0.100552 |  it's going to be Ramadriod.
[7181.32 - 7183.32] P:1897.75 E:0.105827 |  Whether or not they'll be capable, we'll have to wait and see.
[7183.32 - 7186.32] P:2002.33 E:0.095458 |  But Arsenal should take so much belief,
[7186.32 - 7191.32] P:1955.20 E:0.104049 |  so much confidence about how strong this group is as a team, as a unit,
[7191.32 - 7196.32] P:1935.42 E:0.103526 |  the attitude and work rate that you could really sense and feel
[7196.32 - 7198.32] P:1983.25 E:0.107876 |  and sample for being in the ground.
[7198.32 - 7200.32] P:1883.38 E:0.100824 |  It had a real intensity about it.
[7200.32 - 7203.32] P:1898.94 E:0.105722 |  It had a belief about it, and I think that's what drove the result
[7203.32 - 7205.32] P:2047.88 E:0.092684 |  to be honest.
[7205.32 - 7207.32] P:1884.20 E:0.095212 |  Tactically, it was great.
[7207.32 - 7209.32] P:2039.60 E:0.097906 |  A load of players played well individually,
[7209.32 - 7212.32] P:1886.33 E:0.104044 |  but it just had a feel of a team with that kind of confidence,
[7212.32 - 7214.32] P:1955.41 E:0.108061 |  which is what you need when you're going to go away from home
[7214.32 - 7216.32] P:1922.39 E:0.097194 |  to a difficult place to play.
[7216.32 - 7219.32] P:1836.61 E:0.114170 |  So much confidence from that, that Arsenal.
[7219.32 - 7223.32] P:1927.50 E:0.101536 |  And Peter the DJ is bringing out all the hits, Dado.
[7223.32 - 7225.32] P:1931.57 E:0.103823 |  All missing now is Deakin Blue.
[7225.32 - 7227.32] P:1783.60 E:0.089334 |  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[7227.32 - 7230.32] P:1937.56 E:0.120607 |  This is the Mecal Marino song, isn't it?
[7230.32 - 7232.32] P:1988.38 E:0.108681 |  The Arsenal fans sing.
[7232.32 - 7234.32] P:1933.90 E:0.117960 |  As those 12 sort of hinting earlier is,
[7234.32 - 7237.32] P:1799.20 E:0.105374 |  it's difficult for the players because they're going to have to come out now
[7237.32 - 7239.32] P:2038.11 E:0.100414 |  and say, well, you know, it was really good,
[7239.32 - 7241.32] P:1912.97 E:0.114742 |  but job done and we'd go again at the Burnabout.
[7241.32 - 7244.32] P:1981.65 E:0.101470 |  The fans, though, particularly the home leg,
[7244.32 - 7246.32] P:1831.39 E:0.093624 |  the fans can properly celebrate this one.
[7246.32 - 7248.32] P:1941.49 E:0.097882 |  Oh, yes, very much so.
[7248.32 - 7252.32] P:1958.15 E:0.106385 |  And I think Mi'kela Teta, he talked yesterday, had me about saying
[7252.32 - 7254.32] P:1961.07 E:0.096735 |  he wanted the supporters to play their part.
[7254.32 - 7258.32] P:1979.75 E:0.101055 |  And I think every Arsenal fan that came into the stadium tonight
[7258.32 - 7262.32] P:2006.08 E:0.099211 |  and they're playing energy and so much vocal support,
[7262.32 - 7265.32] P:2082.16 E:0.098433 |  they helped create what is turning into a fortress.
[7265.32 - 7269.32] P:2085.07 E:0.102824 |  That's 17 games unbeaten now at home in UEFA competitions
[7269.32 - 7273.32] P:2086.70 E:0.103880 |  since they lost to Olympiacos in 2021 in the Europa League.
[7273.32 - 7275.32] P:2080.02 E:0.105988 |  So the supporters have played their bit.
[7275.32 - 7280.32] P:2049.43 E:0.103247 |  Trying to think, they've got the allocation next week of 3,875.
[7280.32 - 7283.32] P:2088.05 E:0.102287 |  There might be a few more who might be looking to try
[7283.32 - 7285.32] P:2001.27 E:0.103801 |  and make their way out to Madrid.
[7286.32 - 7289.32] P:1906.96 E:0.100871 |  But listen, they've given themselves the perfect platform.
[7289.32 - 7292.32] P:1959.79 E:0.104444 |  Have you seen Arsenal fans celebrate like that
[7292.32 - 7294.32] P:2008.95 E:0.099556 |  in front of you when sat here before?
[7294.32 - 7296.32] P:1901.48 E:0.088622 |  I'm not sure if I have. No.
[7296.32 - 7301.32] P:1951.62 E:0.097773 |  I think they just enjoyed that second half of football.
[7301.32 - 7304.32] P:1927.85 E:0.100785 |  They enjoyed it to the maximum and rightly so.
[7304.32 - 7307.32] P:1991.80 E:0.097228 |  You're right, Kelly, the players, they have to play it down,
[7307.32 - 7310.32] P:2011.57 E:0.094576 |  but the supporters certainly didn't do that around us.
[7310.32 - 7313.32] P:2009.66 E:0.114545 |  Matthew Upton, Andy and Dennis Withers from the Emirates,
[7313.32 - 7315.32] P:1830.50 E:0.113851 |  Andrews Townsend also here as well,
[7315.32 - 7318.32] P:1985.56 E:0.102542 |  and we'll be reflecting on Arsenal's 3-0 victory
[7318.32 - 7320.32] P:2067.64 E:0.094616 |  against the European champions, Real Madrid,
[7320.32 - 7323.32] P:1991.16 E:0.085723 |  in their quarter-final first leg of the Champions League.
[7323.32 - 7327.32] P:2055.71 E:0.042699 |  We'll be doing all of that between now and 10.30.
