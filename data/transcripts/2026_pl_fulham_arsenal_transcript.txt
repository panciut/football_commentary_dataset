 Fulham against Arsenal with Franny Bernali and Alistair Bruce Ball. Thank you, Mark. We've enjoyed a really atmospheric build-up to this one in this cosy corner of West London. Referee Anthony Taylor is about to blow the whistle at the start. The game, the players have all taken the knee ahead of kickoff. It was part of the Premier League's message, the Premier League reinforcing the message this weekend, no room for racism in the game of football, in society at large. And this Premier League game is underway, with Fulham on the attack, all in white, shooting towards the cut-the-end away to our left-hand side. Ryan Cessignon on the dribble, stopped in his tracks by Jury and Timber, who clears up towards the halfway line. And Yocarez tries to keep that in play, a couple of touches, and it runs over the touchline and goes out for a throw-in to Fulham. Some famous faces in the crowd this evening, I'm told. Mick Jagger sitting in the cottage away to our left-hand side. I'm sure the cameras will pick him out. And Ted Lasso in the house as well might tell him there's a job going at Nottingham Forest, if he fancies that. And Prostakoglu sacked today after their 3-0 defeat at home to Chelsea. We want your reaction to that. On 6-06 tonight, which follows this second Premier League commentary of the day on five live and BBC sounds. Arsenal, they've been supplanted at the top of the Premier League table with Manchester City's 2-0 win against Everton. They are behind City on goal difference, only win this one, and they will have a three-point lead this Saturday night. Tom Kearney playing a ball into the Fulham midfield, into the feet of one of the former Arsenal players involved here. A woby back to another one of those, Bernt Leno. A little touch off Sackersfoot as Fulham play up the left-hand side, and it goes out for a throw-in to Fulham in the left back. Position, good evening. Welcome, Franny Bernali, looking forward to this one. Very much so, Ali. Great to join you again. You mentioned about Ted Lasso being in the crowd today. I would have grown my moustache back in honour of him if I'd known. I needed at least a few days to have a good bit of growth, but really looking forward to this one. This has been the best opportunity for Fulham to pick up their points with the performances and results they've had here so far this season, but you've got to say it's going to be a huge test and a difficult challenge for them this afternoon. Coming up against this Arsenal side, they're just so positive, full of confidence and so hard to beat at the moment. Strong tackle by Timothy Costania on Leandro Trossard. Arsenal get a free kick. Arsenal in change kit this evening, so playing from left to right in the first half as we look out from our commentary position in the Johnny Haines stand. That is dark blue shirts with red trim and white numbers on the back. One change from the 2-0 win against West Ham, which came before the international break. Zubemendi in for Erdogan, here's Yocarez, chasing a long ball through into the Fulham penalty area. Leno off his line quickly and grabs it just inside the box. Arsenal have Ryre in goal, Timber Saliba, Gabrielle and Calafiori, Ezra, Zubemendi and Rice, Saka, Yocarez and Trossard. This is Fulham coming forward, as you can probably tell from the noise in the Johnny Haines stand around us. Saliba intercepts, the clearance only finds a woby, cross comes in, Gabrielle heads it away, flying volley from Trossard. The ball bounces once short of the halfway line. Joachim Anderson is there, short pass forward into the feed of Sander Berger. Good sharp start by Fulham, knocking it around nicely. Harry Wilson receives the ball wide on the right and he plays back into his own half. The good news for Fulham is that Raoul Jimenez is fit to start the game and here he goes, chasing a long ball downfield. It bounces once into the arms of David Ryre. That will make a massive difference, he won it, having a recognised centre forward. Josh King, the 18-year-old, had to do that job in the last game against Bournemouth. Yeah, and it's one of those key positions, Ali, isn't it? You know, asking a young 18-year-old as good as he is and as talented as he is to sort of take that major position and be the major goal threat is a lot to ask on a youngster's shoulders. So having him in his back-in, his experience, what he brings to the side and hopefully some goals from Fulham's perspective as well, will be a big bonus for them. Three minutes in, five live in BBC Sounds at Craven Cottage, which is buzzing this evening on the banks of the Thames. Declan Rice gets on the ball for the first time for Arsenal. A couple of strides to his left, finds Trossard, Trossard floats one over the top, Anderson heads it straight up in the air. Yoccare's underneath it here, Quenka's trying to hold him off and does so. And it ends up in the arms of Berndtlenna. I do know Ted Lasso's not his real name, by the way. Jason Sudeckis is his real name, just in case you get messages in. But Jason Sudeckis apparently is sitting in that giant riverside stand opposite us. Jimenez, chest the ball down inside the Fulham half, appeals for a handball. But actually it's knocked out of play by Zubemendi for a Fulham throw. So three changes for them from that 3-1 defeat at Bournemouth before the international break. Jorge Quenka, centre-back. He comes in for only a second Premier League start of the season. His second season at the club having joined from Villareal. It's a de-op drops to the bench. Now, Soda's Calvin Bassey, Tom Kearney, has come in for him, making a first Premier League start of the season. The experienced Scotsman in central midfield. Ryan Cessignon's drop to left back, Jimenez is in for the injured Sasha Lukic. So it's Lano in goal. Kostanya Anderson, Quenka and Cessignon as the back four. Berger and Kearney, then Harry Wilson, Josh King, Alex Iwobi and Raoul Jimenez up top. Trossard's lost it just inside the Fulham half. King, 50-50 challenge with Zubemendi. King goes down right under the nose of Anthony Taylor, who doesn't give a free kick. Diagonal ball quickly shipped out to the right-hand side by Reisaker. Takes it down and moves with the ball in his stride. Lays it back to Timber just outside the penalty area. Little touch, he moves it to the left, finds Calafiori. One touch from him, wide to Trossard. Trossard trying to take on Kostanya and then balloons the cross over the bar and behind for the goal kick to Fulham. So five and a half minutes in, Fulham nil, Arsenal nil. Franny Bernali. Really bright start from both teams, Ali, isn't it? And it's interesting, the amount of times Arsenal, yes, they can play incredible football, but they're quite happy to go quite long up to Geico, isn't they? Pretty direct, looking to play the ball in the channels. He'll put them under the sense halves of Fulham working them physically and running into those channels, but Fulham have been pretty positive as well with their sharpness and the Christmas and the ball that they've played around so far. Lost their last two games, Fulham, both away from home at Villa and Bournemouth. They've won their last two at home against Leeds and Brentford. Sacker under pressure from Cessignon, can't control the ball. Fulham whack it high in the air, Gabrielle leans forward, heads it towards Reis. Reis wins it off King and Arsenal move it quickly to the right. Timber crosses the halfway line, plays it to Esses, seems to have. There's three white shirts around him. I know they're not close to him all the time in the world. Little pirouette on the ball, gets involved again, feeds it to Gabrielle. Wide it goes to the little figure of Trossard. Trossard over on the far side of the field to where we're sitting. Back it comes towards us now. Here's Timber, who's had such a fabulous start of the season for Arsenal. Sacker, caught by Cessignon, made a little bit of that, I think, but it was a free kick and Arsenal get the decision and the free kick is midway. Fulham half taken quickly by Timber. Yocarez was alert and Anthony Taylor's actually going to pull that back. Yocarez, for an he hasn't scored in his last eight games for club and country and for a man who's been so used to being so prolific at Coventry in this country and then obviously sporting for the last couple of seasons. Just on a little run at the moment without a goal, Sacker's crossed into the Fulham box, headed away, cushioned down by Trossard, finds Calafiuri, another cross into the far post, Cessignon heads it away for Fulham, bounces in front of Rice and the pressure on the Fulham defence is incessant and the ball is knocked out off Josh King and that will be an Arsenal throw, which Sacker takes. Yeah, just coming back to Goyka, as Ali mentioned, he'll be frustrated not to be scoring more prolific what he has done so far. Was it 97 goals in 102 appearances, something like that at sporting? So, you know, he'll want to be sort of getting on the scoresheet more regularly than what he has done so far, but we've heard Nicolà Teta already saying it's not just the goals that he brings to the side, it's what else he brings with that presence and the runs that he makes up on that high line for Arsenal. Trossard's ball finds Rice just outside the Fulham box, slides it into the channel. Yocarez bundles the ball back into the box, hasn't been trying to get on the end of it, just didn't get the proper contact on the cross and Fulham have cleared it for an Arsenal throw, attacking position on the left-hand side. Talking Arsenal goal scorers, producer George pointed out to me this morning, 20 years ago today, Thierry-Henry scored two goals away against Sparta-Pragan, the Champions League. The first one equaled Ian Wright as Arsenal's record goal scorer of all time. The second one took him past in 20 years ago today. That time is absolutely... I can still picture Henri playing for Arsenal. I mean, he's probably fit enough still to be out there for any. I know, Ian Wright and Henri were incredible players and goal scorers, weren't they? I remember Ian Wright giving me many nightmares over the years. The goals he scored against us is a real pain to play against, but what fabulous footballers they both were. Yeah, two fabulous Arsenal strikers. Jimenez flick on here, that lands at the feet of Calafiori, and Arsenal will start to build inside their own half. Fulham-Nil Arsenal-Nil, more reaction to all the football at half time. Big news of the day, Ange-Poster-Coglu sacked within less than half an hour at the Nottingham Forest 3-0 defeat at home to Chelsea. Fulham have broken an Arsenal move-up, and Harry Wilson nearly played in by Jimenez on the right. He will be able to keep this ball in play down by the ball line, in front of those Arsenal fans, supporting run from Kostanya. Our trust-side did so well for his team, they'd have covered that run, come back and make the challenge, and eventually Gabrielle twists it down field, it clears Jocerez, and goes all the way through to Lano. Good atmosphere in here this evening. Yeah, and the Fulham players have got to really make use of that as well. The home support behind them, they've seen some positive results and points here at the Craven Kostas so far this season, so the players have got to use that, they've got to use that as fuel, keep the momentum up, and we saw it there, how they smothered out as they're in midfield, then all of a sudden it was Wilson who broke forward, looking for that sharp counter-attack. Fulham fans won't thank me for saying this, but Marco Silva is one of the names that has been mentioned in connection with the Nottingham Forest job. I think it would cost a pretty penny to get him out of Fulham in his fifth season in charge here, and Fulham enjoying a good spell back in the Premier League, so we'll have no more mention of that. Fulham fans won't thank us for it, ten minutes into the first half, here's Gabrielle, Gabrielle, that pass is intercepted, there's King. Wilson on the move for Fulham down the right, players have got to get forward to support him, slides the pass towards him, and tries to hit it first down the cross-goal, nearly ran into the parter who will be just beyond him, it bobbles behind, but the last touch came off an Arsenal player, and that will be a corner for Fulham, who are giving as good as they get so far. They are, and it is the poor place pass, as you mentioned, from Gabrielle, but look how quick Fulham reacts, they've got bodies, him and his making the run forward, and he's certainly happy to try and shoot from a tight angle. One goal so far for Raoul Jimenez this season, here's Iwobe, corner is floated deep, hit on the volley and blocked. That was a really good striving, Joachim Anderson struck that on the left foot volley, called it very, very sweetly, Fulham have worked it to the left, Rice is in there to intercept, clears on the half volley on the turn, and Anthony Taylor maybe waited for a second there, I wonder where the VAR were looking at a possible handball on the block on the volley. Well worked, no it wasn't, who hit them, was it Kenny? Kenny with the left foot volley. Fabulous strike, he looked certainly one off the training ground, Ali didn't it, it was well worked, picked him out, edged a box, there was just a lot of bodies to try and get the shot through. Yeah, caught one of the Arsenal defenders in the mid-riff, and I think that's why VAR just had a look for a second to see whether there was any potential handball involved, which there was. And here's Saka, back to Ezz, the first time ball, Yocarez won't get that, gives up the chase, and it runs all the way through, to Bernt Leno, so yeah, he's a former Arsenal player in goal for Fulham, has never kept a clean sheet against his former club Arsenal, it will be starting, he's played ten times against his former club, and has never scored against them, Emil Smith Rowe is on the bench as well, so there are plenty of Arsenal alumni involved here at Craven Cottage, there's Trossard's ball, back to Gabrielle, loose pass again from Gabrielle, and Jimenez is onto this one, finds Berger, good ball to Wilson, tries to shot nearly, finds the bottom corner, didn't go for power there, just went for placement, David Wright had the angles right, but he was concerned, the ball, fell past him and also went beyond the post, Fulham then Arsenal nil. Well, not for the first time already this afternoon, we've seen Arsenal trying to play out from the back, and Fulham just pounced on the mistake, the intercept, the pass, and it's Wilson with the shot, as you say, takes it early, trying to place it in the far corner, just can't get enough curl on the ball on target. Here's Anderson chasing a flicked header back to the edge of his own penalty area, Sacher is the closest to him, Anderson plays the ball forward, Zubemendi stretches out a left leg, gets a grazing touch on the ball, and it runs here to William Saliba. Three goals conceded in 10 games in all competitions by Arsenal so far this season, all of those in the Premier League, one in the 1-0 defeat away to Liverpool, that was the sobbersly stunner, Erling Haaland scored against them at the Emirates, that game finished 1-1, and the other one came away at Newcastle, but Arsenal historians have worked out, I think it's, in terms of a start to the season defensively, they reckon it is the best in the club's history, so bar none this season, the best performance by any Arsenal defence after 10 games in all competitions, they're knocking the ball around for fun inside their own half, it comes across here to Timber. There's been some late goals as well, hasn't there, Ali, in those wins, you know, so they're showing that resilience throughout the game, staying in matches, scoring late winners, important goals in a late stage of the game, it's always a good sign, I think, from a quality side. Comfortable possession for Arsenal at the moment, come out to 15 minutes played, full of nil Arsenal nil, his saliva creeping forward inside his own half, sees his path blocked by Jimenez, rolls it across to Gabrielle, who purposely side-footed the ball down the left at Trossard, tries to turn away from Kostania, Belgian against Belgian over there, Kostania gets a foot in, and out it goes for the throw-in to Arsenal, in front of the two team benches there, Califiori in front of his manager, Nick LR Teter in the dark black coat this evening, grey skies above us, but not overly chilly, nice evening for your football. Here's Tim, but two more Premier League commentaries coming your way tomorrow on Five Live, Spurs against Villarit two o'clock in the company of Jonathan Pierce and Rob Green, Jonathan's doing this game for Match of the Day tonight, so you hear his dulcet tones on that show this evening, and then the big one at Anfield tomorrow, full commentary Liverpool Manchester United, what a hit! What a hit from Ricardo Califiori with his left foot, but the flag is up, it will not count, it was the long diagonal, taken down by Trossard, Califiori continued the run forward, we've seen him do that before for Arsenal, he shakes his head, he's livid with himself, he's in an offside position, he made the run through the middle, Trossard lays it off, they'll have a look at that, Franny, what do you think that's going to be offside? I think he's going to just very, very slightly, it's harsh because it's a fabulous move from Arsenal, the ball in from Trossard and the finish from Califiori, what a strike with his left foot, there's no stopping it, it has been disallowed. Califiori offside, what a strike on the half volley, it remains full of nil, Arsenal nil and the decision is made clear on the big screen, big screens at both ends of the ground, Timbers lost it to Sessignon, once a free kick, he's not going to get it, Sessignon curls that low ball into the Arsenal penalty area, dealt with for now by Zubemendi, Iwobi has it, Sessignon still there on the left, down by the byline, cuts this back, Arsenal have got it away again and then there's a foul given for a challenge by Rao Jiménez inside the Arsenal penalty area and he's desperation to win the ball back, Anthony Taylor says he's committed the foul and Arsenal have a chance to clear their lines, great start to this game though, 16 minutes in, full of nil, Arsenal nil. Great play as you mentioned Ali, full of nil, but you've got to say it's Arsenal that are causing their own problems, Timber on that occasion, a little bit sloppy getting caught on the ball, Gabrielle's been the same, few passes on the other side, they've just got to be that little bit crisper, a little bit sharper because Fulham has certainly come out the traps from the first whistle to press Arsenal in these opening stages. Tour of course, we'll take Arsenal back, top of the table, a point ahead of Manchester City, Liverpool, Manchester United, yes, full commentary on that tomorrow, kicks off at half-four at Anfield, John Murray or Golden Face as he's now known, you've got to listen to the latest episode of the Commentator's View, podcast to find out why he's alongside Stephen Warnock for that game. Here's Josh King on the right for Fulham, they've made a really bright start, left-footed strike has headed over the bar by Declan Rice, and had Rice not been in the way, that would have tested Gavin Ryan. Arsenal under the cost a little bit here. They certainly are and the home supporters are behind them, it's just the positivity, Josh King takes a couple little touches, cuts inside, probably was going straight towards the goalkeeper, but they've won another corner, and the supporters have shown their appreciation for what they've seen from their team so far. Craven Cottage is Jan Pacht, Fulham have been awkward opponents at Craven Cottage last couple of seasons for Arsenal. Arsenal not won on the last two visits, as that corner comes into the near post, him and his. They might have got a touch on that, Timber blocks it, there'll be another corner for Fulham, finished one-one here last season, and the season before that, Arsenal came here on New Year's Eve and lost that game by two goals to one. Another corner for Fulham, will come in from the right, 18 minutes played in the first half, two Fulham players over there, the Wobbe and Wilson, Wilson runs over it, the Wobbe with an away swinger, him and his, thinking about the volley, Michael Ezra there, Ezra's down holding his head, that'll be a free kick to Arsenal, inside their own penalty area, as we know, Arsenal are difficult to score against, but Fulham are doing their damnedest to do that, nice exchange between Jimenez and Ezra there. Jimenez, amidst the wrongdoing, went for the volley with his right foot and caught Ezra on the head, and of course it was against Arsenal, but Jimenez had that horrible head clash, which caused a really bad head injury. Five years ago now, David Louise playing for Arsenal on that day, and here is William Saliba on the ball for Mick LR Teta's team. Zubemendi comes back to help out, gives it back to Saliba, walking pace up towards the halfway line, plays to his right to Timber, doesn't see an option going forward, so across he comes to Saliba again, short ball forward to Rice, who gives it straight back to the giant French centre back, who wears number two for Arsenal, Rice stays back there, Saliba gives the ball to him, Rice looks forward again, and then just flicks it back to Saliba, who goes through the lines towards Calafiore, he's popped up in midfield, it's come straight back to Saliba again, hesitates slightly, uses Gabrielle, and again Saliba's the main man here trying to make it happen, low pass up towards Sacher, who's coming up the right hand touch line, he receives it, gives it back to Saliba, forward to Ezra, and Ezra, his pass, bobbles back to David Ryder, Ryder's outside his penalty area, sees Rice in a bit of space in the right back position, because Timber's gone on down that right hand touch line, Rice is running away from Jimenez here, he's running across the Arsenal half, plays it to Ezra, shouts a man on from some of the Arsenal fans, because Harry Wilson was closing in behind, has come back to Saliba, who sees Trossard in space on the left, first time volleyed pass, looking for Calafiore, he took a deflection and finds him, back it comes to Trossard, Veldt first touch from the Belgian, then tries to thread a little ball through to Calafiore, which doesn't get there, full him into set, chip ball down the right hand touch line, Rice is there, missed controls, and it goes out for the full and throw for Anibonali. Yeah, a lot of possession for Arsenal, they're taking their time, there was a bit of patience just retaining the ball, no real rush to move forward, but I've got to say, there wasn't a huge amount of movement from the players ahead of them, Fulham just quite happy to shut off the gaps and close the spaces, but you've got to say, that's a ball that Arsenal are looking to play, long diagonal pass out to Trossard, Calafiore is making a run inside, it's a dangerous play. Great movement from Timber, finds Saka, moving at speed into the full and box, gets it on the left foot and hits that shot, doesn't get it quite right, blocked by Kearney, Wilson, back pedaling, stumbling backwards almost, gets a head on the ball and it goes out for an Arsenal throw on the left, but that is exactly what Saka did against Wales at Wembley, dropped the sharder onto the left foot and whipped it into the top corner, couldn't quite pull it off at Craven Cottage this evening, but Sessignore is going to have his hands full over on Fulham's left hand side. Played just over 20 minutes, Arsenal setting up for a long throw here, which will be taken by Calafiore in front of that towering riverside stand, three or four paces he takes, in comes the throw, flick on from Saliba, Trossard miss cues, Josh King sticks a leg out and gets the ball away, falls to the feet of Zubemendi, prods it to his right to Timber, Timber's midway inside the Fulham half, shows a clean pair of heels to Iwoobi, gives it to Ezzer, Ezzer lays it off to Saka on the right, drags his left foot over the ball, goes for the byline, Sessignore slides in, gets a touch on the cross, loops up in the air and Leno's able to catch it, that is why Saka is so dangerous though, Frany, Josh King's gone down, that's no foul, Arsenal can keep playing here and Saka's got it again on the right, so it's Saka against Sessignore on part three, passed this time from Saka to Trossard, forward into the box, Timber with a little flick, Saka is there again, looking for Trossard, very tight spaces, and Wilson is eventually able to volley the ball away, Jimenez gives chase, Saliba's underneath it, Jimenez runs into Saliba, falls over, and Saliba just keeps his calm, passes the ball to Zubemendi, on it goes to Rice and Rice starts striding forward, plays it to Calafiore, wide it goes to Trossard on the left, dummies the ball in field with his right foot, and comes back towards Gabrielle, who's 10 yards inside this full-am half, 22 minutes play, that ball is beyond Saka, Leno lets it go, and it goes through for the goal kick, but they're in a minute, Frany, and you'll appreciate this as a fullback, Saka can go either side, can't he? So he can get onto that left foot and whip it into the top corner, that time he dummies to go left and goes down to the byline. Yeah, when you come off against those kind of players, it's so difficult at times, and it's going to be a great little match-up that today, isn't it, Sessignore against Saka? But even when you know sometimes that he likes to come in on his left foot, you find it hard to almost stop them, because you know it's coming almost, but you've got to get tight enough to actually stop the ball, but he's got that option, as you say, to go the other way, so it's really hard to come up against that kind of player. And you only have to be off-balance for a split second, don't you? And then he's got you and he's gone, he sees the gap and he's gone, basically. Here's Calafiore, who's had the ball in the net tonight, ruled out for offside, he's lost the ball here, midway inside the full-am half, and then he's taken Kearney to King, crossed to Sander Berger, plays it to the small slight figure of Josh King, who's really making a mark on this full-am team this season, comes wide left to Iwobe. Iwobe is taken on Timber, up to the corner of the penalty area, he decides to head for the byline on the left, Timber blocks, and it goes behind for a goal kick in the end. The evening kick-off in the Scottish Premiership tonight is Kilmarnock at home against the leaders' hearts. Kenny Crawford. Yeah, nine minutes gone, it's Kilmarnock, and now Hearts now, remember, if Hearts win this evening, they'll go five points clear at the top of the Premiership with Celtic not playing Dundee until tomorrow. No major chances yet, but interesting night ahead for Kilmarnock goalkeeper Eddie Beech's first league start, 22 years old, and that's because he's in for the injured Max Stryat. Kilmarnock, now Hearts now. 25 minutes played at Craven Cottage, five live in BBC's sounds, full-am Nile Arsenal, Nile. Couple of evenings kick-off five 30 games in the National League, Sutton United lead Hartley for 1-0, and Mark Hughes, Carlisle United lead Robbie Savage's Forrest Green Rovers, the two former Welsh internationals, go head-to-head tonight, Carlisle lead, Forrest Green 1-0. Robbie will be back on 6-06 tomorrow. Aaron Paul and Chris Sutton taking the course tonight, the lines will be open from half-time in this game, and there is plenty to talk about tonight. And do not mismatch the day, BBC 1 at half-ten, particularly for Palace Three, Bournemouth Three, which sounded like an absolute cracker. And Mitheta should have won the game, has scored a hat-trick, got it back to 3-3 with the penalty, and they missed the best chance of all to score his fourth goal and win the game for Crystal Palace. Highlights of the Premier League football on the iPlayer from 8-0 tonight on the BBC, matched the day at half-ten. It will be good ball to Wilson, the shot is dragged wide, Ryder had it covered, and it goes behind for the goal kick. But again, correct from Fulham. And it's the movement, I think, from Fulham. A way of it doing well, coming inside, but it just takes one player to just shift to one of the Arsenal players, and it's a good pick-out with the pass, but Wilson just scuffing his pass or shot, should I say. No real power or real accuracy, but I think Lea would have had that covered, certainly, as you mentioned. Here's Declan Rice trying to take control of things for Arsenal, playing in this dark blue change kit this evening, Ezra in his bright green boots, close to us on the right-hand touch line. Infield to Saka, Sessonion's flowing everywhere. Saka's not having any of that. Twist and turns, gets away from him. Back to Timber. Sessonion's puffing now, and Arsenal have quickly switched the ball away to the left, launched high by Rice, chested down by Trossard. Trossard with pace on the pass, misses Calipheori. Here's Wilson from deep inside his own half, looking for him in airs. Orc would run for him in airs, runs into Timber. Has he been given the free kick for that? I think he has. Look at Timber's reaction. Yeah. I think that tells you that he doesn't agree with Anthony Taylor. Here's the cynic in me, Franny, and you're the former professional footballer. Jimenez sees that as a difficult ball to control, doesn't control it, knows there's going to be contact, goes down, makes a meal of it, and gets the free kick. Well, you've said it all day, exactly. It was a poor touch from Jimenez, and he's fooled Anthony Taylor into a warden full of the free kick. Used to drive me crazy when forwards did that. Jocky Mamberson forward to young Josh King. Cross here to Tom Kearney. Kearney now in his 11th season as a Fulham footballer. Having joined from Blackburn all those years ago. He's seen the ups and downs with Fulham, very much the ups at the moment. Here's Gabrielle, under pressure from Wilson, manages to hold him off, plays it back to Ryre, who's all in green. The Arsenal goalkeeper away to our left. Pass forward to Timber, Arsenal have won their last four games. In all competitions, league cup away to Port Vale. Champions League at home to Olympiacos, a couple of Premier League games too. Saliba, Ezzer just in front of him inside the Arsenal half. Ezzer, low pass, wide right to Timber. Timber speeds infield with the ball at his feet. Kearney's in front of him now, little chip ball over the top. Sakharov chase, well read by Quenka, who sticks out a right leg and volleys the ball away for a throw in to Arsenal. Attack in position on the right, 28 minutes played in the first half. Kilmarnock and Hart still goalless in the Scottish Premiership. His Saka is able to turn here and nearly got the ball through to Durian Timber. Ezzer is strong there. Love his skills as well with the ball at his feet, which is what we know him for. He used the strength as well to hold his man off and Zubemendi has worked it out to the left to Trossard. Down the line it goes to Calafiori, first time cross, looking for Yucca Rez. Cleared away and then lob back into the box by Timber, but no real accuracy on the pass and it ends up in the arms of Berne Lenno. Arsenal, he's talking about Ezzer there. Whenever he is on the ball in those tight areas in midfield, he's a fabulous footballer, he's got the vision, the awareness, the skill. Just a rig all away from players, even shutting him down and putting him under a lot of pressure. Fulham have done it pretty well and it feels on the balance of the game so far, Ali, that although Arsenal have had a huge amount of possession and take away that goal that was disallowed by VAR for Calafiori, it seems like Fulham have had a lot more of the chances so far. Yeah, been good at home so far this season, Fulham, showing it again tonight. Here's Ezzer though, got to be careful with him, surrounded by white shirts. Josh King takes the ball off his toes and immediately, King's first thought is positive, didn't look back, he's head downfield 40 yards, chased by Ezzer amongst others, turns away from Ezzer, now gets it, no, it's a shot not across, and Raya has to flick it over his own bar. Saw Raya off his line, that was sheer impedance from Josh King and trying to curl it in from over on the right wing. Raya saves it comfortably in the end, but I love that from Josh King. Well, I was just thinking what sort of maturity he showed, just holding the ball up for a while, but I'm just thinking if that was an actual effort or a cross in the box, it was only a woby that was probably in there, he lifts his head up. I think it might have been more of a cross trying to wrap his foot around it, but it certainly had Raya scrabble in to make sure he had to put the ball over the bar. Corner for Fulham, can they get themselves in front? Wilson's delivery, headed away to the edge of the box, Saka is there, fix it over his shoulder, a volleyed attempt from Cessignon bounces through harmlessly and goes behind for the goal kick, unless King is trying to dummy-ribe, by giving him the eyes, pretending he's crossing, maybe I'm giving him too much credit there for any. He's gone for goal. He would have claimed it if he had gone in, that's for sure. Well, he got very unlucky, didn't he, earlier in the season, because he's yet to score his first goal for Fulham, but he scored at Chelsea, and that was the one that got ruled out for Rodrigo Manez, treading on the toes of one of the Chelsea defenders. Tom Kearney's down, this is a problem for Fulham. So we've got a break in play at the moment, gives me a chance to remind you the Premier League scores that have happened so far today. So in the lunchtime kick-off, you're reacting to all of these on 6-0-6 tonight, the lines are open at halftime. If you don't know the number, here it is. 08-085-909-693. Chelsea 3-0 winners at Nottingham Forest and Postacoglu sacked after eight games in charge. Brighton 2-Nukasel 1. Burnley beat Leeds 2-0, so Burnley are out of the bottom three this evening, Nottingham Forest have dropped in. Palace 3-Bornwood 3, an absolute thriller. Erling Harland scored two, should have scored more, apparently. Manchester City beat Everton 2-0, and Sunderland beat Wolves 2-0. Might be a shoulder issue here for Tom Kearney. While he's receiving treatment, let's check in again at Rugby Park. Kilmarnock against Hartz in the Scottish Premiership, Kenny Crawford. 16 minutes gone, still Kilmarnock now, Hartz now, but the home side really going close a couple of minutes ago. It was David Watson, the teenage midfielder, shot from 20 yards, and the German goalkeeper, Alexander Schwallow, had to stretch to tip away. Kilmarnock giving as good as I get in at the moment. Kilmarnock now, Hartz now. Yes, Kenny said Hartz top going into that game tonight, two points ahead of Celtic. Celtic player Dundee in the lunchtime kickoff tomorrow. Kenny's back on his feet, and hopefully will be able to continue or wait and see. We've just had a shot at the Fulham owner as well, Shahid Khan, who's in attendance tonight, and it's Cronky against Khan in football here, so Stan Cronky, owner of Arsenal, Shahid Khan, owner of Fulham. Tomorrow at Wembley in the NFL, it's Cronky's Rams against Khan's Jaguars, if you're a fan of the NFL, Brunny. Oh, and you mentioned about watching a game recently before the match today, didn't you? Some NFL action. Here's Rice, back underway. Tom Kenny's not yet back on the field. Paul is back with Zubemendi. Zubemendi is in for the injured Erdogan. That's the only Arsenal change from the 2-0 win over West Ham, and here they come, Timber, 25 yards out. Find Zubemendi looking for Saka on the right. The pass is behind Ezra, it's in front of Saka, and it's actually gone out for a throw-in to Fulham in the left-back position. Fulham Nill, Arsenal Nill, 13 minutes remaining in the first half, and it's been a pretty even contest so far. So, throw-in for Fulham, taken by Sesson, and then the ball is up high in the air. Timber stoopes, heads it towards Saka, into the feet of Yocarez, back to Saka, dainty feet inside the penalty area. Rice plays it across to Calafiori. Calafiori finds Trossard. Trossard back here to Zubemendi. Zubemendi gives it to Gabrielle, who's encouraged to come forward. Little one-two with Declan Rice. Rice back to Zubemendi again. Fulham have every outfield player behind the ball at the moment. Back with Mark Chapman at halftime. Of course, more reaction to the sacking of Ang Poster Coglu today. Not even Forrest Nill, Chelsea 3, it finished. Still Arsenal possession here. Saka up against Iwobi. Chops to his left, runs across the face of the penalty area. Iwobi, former team-mate, sticks with him. Saka's got it back to Gabrielle, forward to Trossard, back to Rice. Goal at Ruby Park, Kenny Crawford. It's an absolutely brilliant goal for the visitors. Comarnock now, Hartz-1. Corner from Harry Mellon and a bullet header by Craig Hawke into the bottom right-hand corner. The league leaders are in front. Comarnock now, Hartz-1. Harry Kane, I see, has scored as well for Bayern Munich against Borussia Dortmund in the evening kick-off in the Bundesliga. Here's Timber. Timber looking for Trossard. Trossard edge of the box, back to goal, gets it to Zubemendi. Is the Fulham defence going to Creeky? Calafiori shoots, big deflection. Hit Yocarez, or no, Fulham defender beside Yocarez. It's gone behind for the Arsenal corner. Robbie Savage and his forest-green rovers have equalised against Carlisle in the National League. That game is 1-1. Ten minutes remaining in the first half, Franny Bernali enjoying the action here at Craven Cottage. Arsenal having a huge amount of possession there, just being patient, but they just can't find that final pass, that killer ball into the box to pick out one of their team-mates. You've got to say, a well-drilled Fulham side that are not looking to run out of good positions. They're just saying, we'll come and break us down. Corner taken short, down the dead ball line to Trossard. Gives it straight back to Rice. First-time ball, Ezzer hits a low shot. He's blocked inside the penalty area. Comes back to Zubemendi. Zubemendi's got support from Salib. Another best pass from Zubemendi there. He's going to have to go scampering back after that inside his own half. Now, Saka is under pressure from Jimenez, who holds onto him, like a ballroom dancer. Grabbed him around the hip. Saka's stop playing, waited for the whistle to go. Always risky that, but the whistle did go. He got the decision. And Arsenal take the free kick and get the ball moving quickly. They won't want to drop any points at all, Arsenal. They know they've got a good chance again of winning the Premier League title this season. Manchester City just ahead of them on goal difference, but they've lost a couple of times this season. Liverpool are points behind them at the start of tonight. Liverpool at home to Manchester United tomorrow. Timber to Saka. Saka to Yurkarez. Yurkarez hits it. Leno saves. Ball bounces up in the air, a truss hard jumps, and Leno grabs the loose ball, having made the save, gets to his feet, runs out and grabs it on the edge of the six-yard box, then tries to get full of him away quickly down the right-hand side and slings the ball straight out of play. That was well worked by Arsenal. Excellent move, wasn't it? Saka just laying the ball off, receiving the return pass, and then it's a threaded ball forward and a strike at Leno. It's a good save down to his right-hand side. Trossard unable to follow up. Here comes Arsenal again. Saka to Timber. Timber confronted by a Wobby. Slow ball across to Saliba. Every Arsenal outfield player on the attack inside the Fulham half. Fulham-nil Arsenal-nil. Trossard looking for an option. Has the ball on the left for Arsenal. Comes back to the centre-circle. Saliba. Across to Timber. Socks rolled low for the Dutchman. Bovelly pass out to the right to Saka. Bit of space to work with here. Saka speeding towards Sessonio. Cross in with the right foot is deep and high. Calafiori on the volley. Fizzing shot, wider the target and behind it goes. For the goal kick, hits the ball well. Ricardo Calafiori, doesn't he? I was thinking exactly the same thing as you were. It's left your lips, Ali. Again, Saka going down to the byline this time. Calafiori, it's an interesting angle, but he's a long way out, but he's just watched the ball all the way onto his left foot. Just over the bar, but it was a great technique. Shows his great technician and he can certainly got a knife for goal. Those are the thoughts of Franny Benali, with us here at Craven Cottage. Fullhamnill Arsenal, nil. Leno's over-hit his pass. Sessonio couldn't keep it in play. He wanted to stop Arsenal, taking their throwing quickly. And he did that for just long enough to do that without getting booked. There was a shrill blast on the whistle because anything that delays the restart of play often gets pinged. Jocarez couldn't control from the Arsenal throw. Woby-Clairs first time. The ball doesn't stick for Fullhamnill and Ryre is able to run forward and collect it for Arsenal. So Hartz, one up at Kilmarnock in the Scottish Premiership. Rangers 2, Dundee United 2 earlier on today. Sarasen Sale in the rugby union. You can listen to him full on sports extra three right now. And sports extra tomorrow. You've got England's women in action in the cricket World Cup on air from 10.15 up against India. His sackah. Sackah's got the beating of Sessonio again. Away he goes down the right. Jimenez back to help, gets a right foot in, knocks it out and behind for the corner to Arsenal. Sackah is starting to get the better of that battle, isn't he? Yeah, he's just getting exposed a little bit more. Sessonio, Woby's got other players to try and deal with. He's not getting that support and it's that one-on-one situation out wide. And Sackah's so dangerous, as we know. Talked already about how he can go either way, how quick he is with his feet. But Arsenal just having more and more of possession of the ball, as we see at the moment. Right, let's see what Arsenal can do with one of their set-piece routines. Classic line-up of four players beyond the far post. The corner's coming in from the right. Ezzer looks on the edge of the box, so does Rice. Zubemendi's slightly deeper than them. Sackah's ball into the near post. Cleared only as far as Sackah. He's got loads of time here to get his head up. Now goes for the far post, knotted down, and volleyed away by Quenka. Rice tries to control it on the volley. Underpressed from him, Woby. Another touch from Rice. King tries to make the tackle. Rice gets a crucial touch, and then King's accidentally caught in the face. He's gone down, holding his face, and Anthony Taylor's seen that. Will he stop the game? Yes, he will. Arsenal attacking. I think a straight hand or finger from Rice has caught King. And Anthony Taylor was caught there. I think he wanted to let the game play. But if a player's down with a head injury and injury to the face, he's got to stop the game. Yeah, it's the rules now, isn't it? But like I say, we'll maybe get an opportunity to see quite how much. I think he's going to be OK, Josh King. But it's one of those things, as you say, he's probably just a flailing arm. He's from his own team, mate. He's Jimenez. So you can see why Arsenal certainly agreed. If you're the team that gets pulled up for that, it's very frustrating when you're breaking away. But you can certainly understand why Anthony Taylor's making that decision. We're seeing Gabrielle sort of reminiscing with why it should have continued. I think Anthony Taylor was sort of part apologising there. I think King is going to be absolutely fine. They're quite right to check, but it's a left-hander. Now, the Mexicans have a great boxing history, don't they? Him and his, but he's not caught him with a full haymaker. It's a glancing blow, and I'm joking about it, but I'm pretty sure Josh King's going to be OK. Arsenal frustrated. That might be Kenny down again for Fulham receiving treatment. Let's go back to Rugby Park. Fulham, they'll ask for a nail. Kilmarnock Hart's been watched by Kenny Kropper. 26 minutes gone, it's Kilmarnock, Nill, Hartz-1, and Hartz since getting that opening goal a few minutes ago, really on the front foot of Rugby Park. They nearly made it two, and Kizeridis, the Greek, put a shot right across goal, where Eddie Beech, the young goalkeeper, was beaten with it, drifted wide of the post. Craig Hall get the goal scorer for Hartz. That's his fifth goal of the season, for a centre-back, it's for Martin Nill, Hartz-1. Thank you, Kenny. Right, Yockeam Anderson is coming off for Fulham, so he's been down receiving treatment. Tom Kearney was also receiving treatment on his shoulder, but Yockeam Anderson, now that is a big blow for Fulham, changes at the back already in this game, and Issa Diop, who was dropped to the bench for this game, is now going to come on and play in this back four, and partner Jorge Cuenca. So Anderson off, who is one of Fulham's star performers, and Fulham's squad, you know, I was looking at this before the game, they really didn't do much business in the summer window. This is pretty much the same squad that tackled the Premier League campaign last season. Kevin was the big money signing, who's been used off the bench so far, and looked really exciting, but to lose someone like Anderson in the first half against Arsenal, that is a blow. Yeah, and it was difficult to see, Ali, wasn't it? What exactly his problem was, but clearly enough for him to come off, and Diop coming in as a like-for-like replacement, but you're right, very little business done in the summer window. It's one of those things we've heard already, how Marco Silva missed players through injury, and how that can impact the club like Fulham, so he certainly doesn't want any more injuries. Game getting back under way with a drop ball at Issa's feet. Takes one touch, and passes it immediately back to Saliba on the halfway line. Three minutes plus added time, then it'll be the halftime whistle. Mark Chapman will pick up again, more reaction to all the football today. The big news, the sacking of Ange Postacoglu. 39 days, I think, in charge of Nottingham Forest. Les Reed, famous, they had 41 in charge of Charlton, but it's all over for Ange Postacoglu at the City Grants, and more reaction to that at halftime, and your thoughts welcome on 6-06 with Aaron Paul, and Chris Sutton this evening. Timbers side-footed a pass down the right to Sacher, and that Hammersmith end away to our right. Beatsy Wobby gets the cross in, good leap from Cuenca at the near post, heads it behind for an Arsenal corner, and Arsenal are so, so dangerous from the corners. I mean, you want to avoid, you want to give Arsenal as few opportunities as possible from the set pieces, don't you? Yeah, and with that change with Anderson going off now, Hullian, just come on. Can they stay focused, stay interested? They've got to go and deal with this threat into the box now. The Hullian defenders. Saliba, Calafiori, Gabrielle, Yocarez, all at the far post, deeper delivery from Sacher. Leno is able to get there first, punches it away with both fists. Ezra plays it back to Zubemendi, his ball forward, smashes Harry Wilson in the face at close range. He's down, that's going to be another stoppage in this game. And that did hit him at pace. Zubemendi was trying to get that ball out quickly to the left-hand side, and Wilson's caught that right in the mush. So he's down, but he's rolled over onto his back, and I hope he's going to be okay. Full of nil, Arsenal nil. Tottenham Villa, two o'clock tomorrow in, full on five line. Liverpool, Manchester United at half four. And if you want a Wayne Rooney preview, who knows all about that game, the Wayne Rooney show comes out twice a week, available as a podcast on the BBC Sounds app. So go and have a listen to that. First half then, Franny Benali, what have you made of things here? Well, I think Marcos would be pretty happy, to be honest, Ali. You know, he's sided very much in this game. They probably sort of dropped off a little bit with the intensity that we saw in the first half of this 45 minutes plus added time. They had a few chances, certainly. Oh, just catching a glimpse of Mick Jagger there. Mick Jagger. I won't sing. Certainly not singing. Insert Jagger from here. But, yeah, Arsenal have sort of dominated possession for a while without really carving out any real chance apart from that Califari sweet strike when the goal was disallowed for offside. So it's very much all to play for in the second half. Mick Jagger's 82, do you know that from that? Well, I've seen them performing concert at St Mary Stadium. Oh, yeah. To have the energy he does around a huge stage at that age is very, very admirable. Watching the football tonight at Craven Cottage. Here come Arsenal down the right. Ezzer takes a touch. Low ball, fist into the near post. Quenka's there again. Heads it away. Jorge Quenka, planets centre back. 25-year-old Spaniard foot, full of him this evening. Basi and Diop were both dropped to the bench, but Anderson now off injured. So Diop has come on. He's the right-sided centre back. Victor Yocarez is stationed in between them. Some late Arsenal attacking in this first half. Just being out of time at the end of the first half. I didn't see how many minutes went up. Five minutes of added time. We've played one of those. Six minutes of added time. We've played one of those. We've got five left. Live maths on five lives at BBC Sounds. And Fulham have done well. Defended Trossard well, and the ball's gone out. For a throw-in to Fulham in the right-back position. Fulham are very happy for the ball to either go out to Sacko or out to Trossard, haven't they? Unless they're going to go and beat somebody, it's almost like they've got to beat the wide men. Sacko's got to beat something like a Wobie first before he gets towards Cessignon. And it's the same over on the other side. They've got two players to beat before maybe delivering a ball or trying to drive to the byline. Just in a bit of leapfrog over on the far side of the field. Fulham go towards Jimenez. Gabrielle came over the back of Jimenez. And leapfrogged him right over his head to win the header and knock it out of play. Another throw for Fulham has turned into a long ball down the right. Gabrielle just leans into Josh King, wins the header. Harry Wilson scampers for the ball, wants to take this quickly. Four Fulham. Four minutes of added time remaining at the end of the first half. Fulham nil, Arsenal nil. Manchester City top of the Premier League table. Head of Arsenal actually on goals scored. Both of them have a goal difference of plus 11. City and Arsenal both on 16 points. Liverpool on 15. Bournemouth on 15 as well. Got themselves three to a head late on against Crystal Palace. They were 2-nil up in that game. They finished 3-3. Here comes the long throw into the Arsenal box. Calafiore towering header away. Kearney nods it forward. Rice wins the next one. Yoccarez speeds towards the ball. Cuenca misses in with the sliding challenge. Good vision from Yoccarez finds Timber. Timber's up to the edge of the Fulham penalty area. Wobys there. Jimenez comes back at pace. Makes the tackle and the ball goes behind for a late Arsenal corner in this first half. Fulham nil, Arsenal nil. It's the first time we really see Arsenal break like that alley, isn't it? They look dangerous to begin with and it's a great first touch and then pass from Yoccarez, but Timber just sort of turning back out, taking their time to deliver the box, ball into the box, but great recovery runs from Jimenez. Cuenca absolutely launched himself at Yoccarez there and was probably quite lucky he didn't catch him. Yoccarez just got to the ball in time. Corner for Arsenal from the right. Saka's going to take it. They've had a few goes at this in the first half. Deeper one to the far post. Leno stretches, gets a right, white glove on the ball. Rice there first for Arsenal. Knocks it down the line to Trossard. The cut back to the edge of the box. Wilson heads it away. One touch here from Saliba, kills it, stone dead. Spins a pass out to Saka on the right. Saka this time goes to his left foot. Again, a high swinging curling cross to the far post. It will be, flexes the neck muscles, flicks the header away out for a throw in to Arsenal. Attacking position on the left. Two minutes of added time remaining. What's been a fascinating first half. Fullham, Arsenal, Niel. Here's Declan Rice, 30 yards out. He looks for the curling ball to the far post. And Gabrielle thought Saka was making the run. Saka stands there. They both look at each other, throw their arms out, both let it go, and it goes behind for the goal kick. Probably wasn't the best of deliveries into the box from Declan Rice, was it? It was in between both players, as you mentioned. One thought, the other one was going for it, and vice versa. You've got to say that's pretty much, I think fullham team will get a pretty good reception from their supporters when the whistle blows for half time. Burned Leno in a sort of burnt orange, goalkeeping uniform this evening. Sweeps the ball away with his right foot. Timber wins the header. Jimenez tumbles backwards over him. Arsenal get the free kick. Jimenez frustrated, just throws his arms up in disappointment. Saliva takes the free kick, crossed to Gabrielle, now given to Declan Rice. One minute of added time, remaining at the end of this first half. Lines will open shortly for 6-0-6, which follows our commentary at Craven Cottage tonight. Coverage of the sprint race, actually at the US Grand Prix. On sports extra right now, qualifying tonight. Coverage starts at 5-10, racing full on, 5 live tomorrow. From half 7, here's Saliva. Low pass to Rice. Rice running across the halfway line. King can't stick with him, but Rice isn't going anywhere in particular there. Comes back to the left to Zubemendi. Rolls a pass back to Gabrielle. Cross it comes to Saliva. Low one zipped out to Saka. Saka prods it in field, finds Eza. Eza back to Saliva. Saliva encouraged to bring it forward. White shirts are full and backing off. Eza sees Zubemendi in a bit of space. Inside left channel, 35 yards from goal. Onto his right foot, then finds Rice in a central position. Curling cross looking for Timber, leaps in the air, brings it down, dummies across, back it comes to Saka. On the left foot, lays it off, Rice whips it wide. You can see what he was trying to do there. Trying to curl one into the top corner. Last action of the first half. We might get the goal kit, let's see. Anthony Taylor points to the centre squat and says that'll do for the first half here at Craven Cottage. Arsenal going close at the end there. They have had the ball in the net. Califiori with a thumping finish, but he was in an offside position. Pulled him to play pretty well, Franny Bernali. Yeah, they've been very solid throughout the second half. Sorry, first half. They started the first half really bright, but they've got Arsenal down, pressing a little bit higher at the pitch and pinching the ball in Arsenal's half. A few sloppy mistakes from Arsenal, but they've got their act together a little bit now. They're dominating the possession. It's one of those games, I think, Allie, where full of it's a lot of concentration they've got to do. It's a lot of communication when the opposition are keeping the ball for so long. Arsenal are just waiting for that one little glitch where one of the players switches off one, two, three yards. That's all it'll be. They've come close on a number of occasions, but that's typified with that shot from Declan Rice. But it's been a decent first half. Yeah, halftime at Craven Cottage, handing you back to a man who does have the moves like Jagger. Full of nil, Arsenal nil. Thank you, Allie. Second half on the way in the National League at halftime. Carlisle, two forest green rovers, one mark, Hughes against Robbie Savage at the top of the National League. Hartley-Pool by Golds nil. Halftime in Scottish League one. Peterhead two, Queen of the South nil. Slightly late kick-off in the Scottish Premiership. As things stank, Kenny Crawford hearts opening up quite a lead at the top of the table. Yeah, if it finishes this way, it's Comarnock nil, Hart's one at the moment. If it finishes this way, there'll be five points cleared at the top, Hart's under Derek McInnes, the former Comarnock manager at close of play tonight with Celtic not playing Dundee until tomorrow. Celtic currently two points behind Hart's. But yeah, it's Craig Halcott on 19 minutes who gave Hart's to lead a really good header from Harry Mills' corner in his fifth of the season, so he's not doing too badly for the Gold tally. But Marcus Dackers close to equalising for Kelly. Kelly, oh, and Hazy, oh, it's just wide of the post there from Marcus Dackers. So Comarnock nil, Hart's one. Halftime in the Gallagher Prem, Saracens 22, sale 14, earlier Leicester beat Bath by 22 points to 20 in the Rugby Championship, and then Leicester 7, monster 21 into the second half earlier on the wins for Ulster. And Lyons, let's go to the sprint race, the United States Grand Prix next commentary on sports extra right now. Harry Benjamin is watching. We're on lap 11 of 19 of this sprint race, dramatic start, Max Verstappen leads, but there was carnage behind, Lando, Norrish and Oscar Piazzari both out after a first corner collision. Nico Holkenberg starts from fourth. Also involved in that, he tagged Piazzari at the first corner, sending the Australian into his teammate. It's an exceptionally warm day here in Cota, and the tensions are high. Verstappen right now, though, looking to bag eight points. Damon Hill, he's really benefited from this, hasn't he, the Dutchman, because he has managed to close down a 63 point gap to Oscar Piazzari coming into this race weekend already, down to 55 with still Sunday's Grand Prix to come. He's very happy with his car. Not only did he outqualify the McLaurons, but now they've been eliminated from this sprint race. He has closed the gap again, although it's a long shot. Max is still in this title high. 1996 F1 World Champion Damon Hill, alongside me for the whole weekend, calling this one lap 11 of 19 Verstappen, leads Russell and Carlos Sainz, the top three. Spalse, actually, if you want to listen to that, T-time game in the Bundesliga, by the way, Bayern against Borussia Dortmund, one nil to Bayern, Harry Kane with that goal, nodding in a corner. In the Premier League today already, Nottingham, Forrest Nill, Chelsea three, Andr Posterkoglu, sacked at the end of that game. You will want to react to that on 6-0-6. Brighton two, Newcastle one, Burnley two, Leeds nil, Palace three, Bournemouth three, Manchester City top of the table, ahead of this T-time game at Craven Cottage, after a two-nil win over Everton, Sunderland beat Wolves two-nil, obviously goalless at Craven Cottage, between Fulham and Arsenal. Coventry went back to the top of the championship with a two-nil win at home to Blackburn, Sheffield United got themselves off the bottom of the table with a one-nil win over Watford. Cardiff for the new leaders of League One, they beat Reading two-one, Stevenage were beaten at Lincoln one-nil, Bradford drew two-all at home to Barnsley. Walsall stay top of League Two, despite a two-one home defeat by Barrow, Cheltenham got themselves off the bottom of the table with a two-nil win at Newport. Plenty of stories for you to react to on 6-0-6, wait 08-5, 9-0-9, 6-9-3. We'll get some reaction to the day's Premier League football as well and find out the latest on Nottingham Forest Search for another new manager after Dan Mortley. The Voice of the UK. This is BBC Radio 5 Live. Next, Chappers, the brother of Virginia Gifre has called on the king to strip Prince Andrew of his prince title after he announced he was giving up his others, including the Duke of York. Prince Andrew has always denied claims by Mr Gifre, that she was sexually abused by him as a teenager. But in a statement last night, he acknowledged that continued accusations against him were distracting from the work of the Royal Family. The Hamas run emergency service in Gaza says 11 people from the same family were killed on Friday night when an Israeli tank shell hit their bus. Israel's military said that the vehicle had crossed a demarcation line. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has instructed that the RAFA border crossing between Egypt and Gaza remain closed until further notice. It follows a statement by the Palestinian Embassy in Cairo that the crossing would open on Monday for Palestinians in Egypt to return to Gaza. Israel has made the return of all remaining deceased hostages' bodies a condition of reopening the border. I can add that in the last few minutes, Hamas's armed wing has said it will hand over two of the remaining bodies this evening. And more than two and a half thousand demonstrations are taking place across the United States to express opposition to the policies of Donald Trump. Organisers say that millions of people are expected to participate in the No Kings protests. Supporters of President Trump have described them as hate America rallies. When you're cosied up on the sofa, when the drama's got you totally hooked, when you're completely engrossed in what's about to happen... Hey, did you eat all these? Oh, sorry, didn't notice. Go on, there's more in the kitchen. Let's get more on Nottingham Forest and sacking Angposta Coglu after 39 games, he wished, at 39 days in charge, eight games without a win, 21 minutes after the final whistle, Nottingham Forest put out a statement this afternoon that he had gone. BBC Sports, Nick Mashita was at the city ground. You kind of sense this was already decided by the hierarchy, don't you, Nick? That if they lost, he was gone. Yeah, I mean, when you see the owner of Angela's Maranacus leave his seat and not return midway through the second half, we started to get a sense that something might be coming. And obviously, the majority of the media, certainly the written media, were all waiting in the press conference room at the city ground, waiting for Angposta Coglu to come in and justify what happened or speak about his future. And then we get a message from Nottingham Forest to say that he's gone. So it wasn't a surprise. 39 days, which is the shortest permanent manager for Nottingham Forest, beating Alex McLeish, who lasted 40 days in charge. So he's managed to beat him by just one day. And it just looked the wrong fit. It was perhaps the wrong person at the wrong time, two bigger jump, two bigger different styles from Nuno Espíritu Sánca, who he replaced in early September. So while there was real willing for this to work, both from the club, from the players, it just isn't acceptance, but it just clearly hasn't worked at all. Do they know what style they want to play? And the reason I ask that is in the two or three hours since he's gone, the two names that seem to be linked, and admittedly, this may be just the media, rather than the forest hierarchy again, but the two names that appear to be linked are Roberto Mancini and Sean Derry. And not Sean Derry. Sean Dice, crikey. Sean Dice, that would have been a surprise Sean Derry if he was listening. And Sean Dice. So, I mean, again, what style do they want? Well, that's the thing, it looks muddled, and it looks directionless at the minute, because you've lurched from Nuno Espíritu Sánca, more pragmatic, more counterattacking, to Anzposa Cogler, who wants to be on the front foot, high tempo pressing. And that was too much too soon. The players, as much as they wanted to do it, couldn't handle it, because there wasn't enough training in between all the games. He had six games in his first 23 games, which isn't enough time to get on the grass on the training pitch, and being able to implement that. But you look at what they've done, the problem at Forest doesn't necessarily stem, doesn't necessarily come from Anzposa Cogler. They spent around £180 million in the summer, but today against Chelsea, only two of their signings started, just Alexander Sánchenko and Douglas Luis, and they are both on loan. There was no James McAtee, no Amari Hutchinson, no Dilem Bacqua, no Calimuendo. And all these players cost around £120 million. So, you have to look at the muddled thinking, perhaps in the summer as well, when they're bringing in these players, of what they were doing, and how they wanted to progress the side, how they wanted to put the squad together. When four of the biggest signings over the summer can't even make the bench today. Nick, thank you Nick Mastur from BBC Sport. Erling Haaland got both as Manchester City went to the top of the Premier League with a two-nil win at home to Everton. Here's his teammate Ruben Diaz. Obviously very happy for him, very happy for us, because him being happy is us being happy. And we need to keep on pushing him, pushing everyone. I remember the first half, Savino had a very good opportunity when he controlled with the chest, and then crossed, maybe he needs to be more incisive, and then take the chance. I remember as well, one from Fili opens, then he serves to Gianni, was in a very good position. Jeremy the same, I mean, obviously very happy for Erling, but we won as a team for everyone to step up. Corners we have to do better, we have to score the chances, and little by little having different, more and more different options of being able to hurt the other team. And also top of the table now as well. Yeah, obviously happy with it, but one game at a time, there's a long season ahead, and we have a lot of work to do, we have a lot of work to do within ourselves to be better and to reach the full potential that we can reach. Ruben Diaz with Chris Sykes, Oliver Glasner on the way after we get half-time from Kilmarne at Kenny. Kilmarne at Nill, Hartz 1, Craig Halkett's fifth goal of the season, a bullet head or the difference between the sides at the moment, but Derek McKinnon says visitors will be kicking themselves, they're not 2-0 in front, because right on the cusp of the half-time whistle, Cammie Devlin, Australian midfielder, was cleaned through, had a shot straight on goal, but straight at young goalkeeper Eddie Beech of Kilmarne at Kilmarne at Nill, Hartz 1 half-time. Crystal Palace came from 2-0 down and 3-2 down to get a 3-0 draw with Bournemouth at Selhurst Park. Jean-Philippe Mtheta got a hat-trick, but he did miss a chance to get the winner very late on. Here is Oliver Glasner with John Searthall. What are the emotions after that, 2-0 down at half-time, 3-3, and then what were you thinking when Jean-Philippe Mtheta had that chance in the 99th minute? Difficult to the way the game went was so exciting, but we believe in us because we have proven it so often that we can score goals, we create chances, and even if we get our first goal in the 70th minute, we are back in the game and so the players did so well. Everyone in the stadium, besides the Bournemouth supporters, they saw 8 minutes extra time and everybody had to believe, hey, this team can come back again and this happened against Liverpool, it happened today, this is our mindset, this is our identity that we want to go for a win. What did you say to Jean-Philippe after this? I don't think I've ever seen someone score a hat-trick look so disappointed at the end. Yes, he apologised and I said, you don't have to apologise, you scored a hat-trick. I think it just shows the mindset we created that we always want more and more and more. What I loved today is, in this situation, Eidene Keite has the ball and he could take the finish there and maybe he would want to be the hero, but this is not this group, you know, then he sees Jean-Philippe Maté and tries to assist him and that just shows how we are as a group and this is how we will be at the end of the season. Let's just hear from Vito Pereira, Wolves beaten 2-0 at Sunderland to remain bottom of the table, just two points, they're five from safety. The first half was poor, in my opinion, technically, poor. A lot of throw-ins, free kicks, corners, I didn't see any game. I think the game was almost the time to stop it, to throw-in, to stop it. It's like when I look for the first half, I don't remember a good game, I don't remember good plays, good movements, I don't remember. Second half, we correct our movements and in my opinion we play 30 minutes with in high quality, creating three or four chances to score, losing the chance and, you know, in Premier League, you cannot lose this kind of chance. Vito Pereira, all the extended highlights and analysis with Gabby and Alan and Mike have matched the day, 10.30 tonight, have your say on 6-0-6, it follows. On 08, 08.05, 9.09, 6.93, Aaron Paul and Chris Sutton this evening, as they say, it follows. 45 minutes from Craven Cottage, which I imagine will be football commentary mixed with Rolling Stones, some titles, Ali. I think I'm going to avoid those marks. Yeah, you won't be available, you won't be able to, you know you're going to slip the old water too over. Yeah, possibly, possibly. I'll tell you what I was doing, Mark, at half-time, just on the Mottetta missed opportunity to get four goers, I'm looking at the list of players in Premier League history who've scored four or more in a game. I know the miss is more important because he didn't win the game, but it's an illustrious list. I'll rattle off a few of the names as the game goes. Thank you, Mark. Enjoy your Saturday evening. Mark is often away, I think it's Gabby Logan actually presenting match of the day tonight, so not Mark Chapman this evening. Half-ten BBC One, Palace Ballmer 3-3 is one definitely worth watching, but yeah, players who've scored four or more in a Premier League game. If Mottetta had joined that list, you would be up with the very great. Players who've scored five, Aguero, Berbertof, Defoe, Shearer, and Andy Cole did it against Ipswich all those years ago in a Manchester United 9-0 win, but we're back underway here. Let's concentrate on this one because Manchester City's win this afternoon has taken them above Arsenal on goals scored at the top of the Premier League table. As it stands, if Arsenal would have drawn this game, they'll go a point ahead of Manchester City. Liverpool at home to Manchester United tomorrow. Arsenal attacking the goal away to our left in this second half at Craven Cottage. They're in change kit this evening. Dark blue, red pinstripe, white numbers, Saka wide on the right, caught by Cessignol, stuck at a right leg, Saka darted to his left and Cessignol just dangled the leg out there and he's caught him with the studs of his boot. So Arsenal will get a free kick. Arsenal have David Ryring goal, Julian Timber, Saliba Gabrielle, Calafiore at the back four, Ezzer, Zubemendi and Rice, Saka, Yocarez and Trossard as they're starting 11 this evening. Fulham had to make a change in the first half. Isiddiop has come on for the injured Yocke Anderson. I'll give you their full team in a second. But here comes an early Arsenal set piece in the second half. Lots of seats empty in the riverside stand opposite us as fans make their way back as Rice takes that free kick. Gabrielle's beaten in the air by Cuenca. Ball bounces twice and Zubemendi quickly spirits it back to Ryre inside his own half. He launches the long diagonal. Trossard wins a good header there against Castagna. Cuenca comes sliding in, clears it first time. Zubemendi nearly mis-controls it, but manages to get it at the second attempt and has the ball in the centre circle. Rice takes control for Arsenal, quickly whips it low out to Saka on the right. Back to Saliba. Saliba scoops one forward looking for the run of Saka. Misku clearance from Sessignio, falls to Timber, he passes it beyond Saka and it goes behind for the goal kick. So Fulham have Bernt Leno in goal, Kastania, Diop, Cuenca and Sessignio are in the back four. Sanderberger, Tom Kearney in front of them, Harry Wilson, Josh King, Alex Iwobi and Raoul Jimenez fit to start tonight as centre forward Rodrigo Manees is still missing. Two and a half minutes into the second half, former Southampton defender Frani Benali alongside me for the commentary tonight. So thoughts from Frani in just a second as Artea is furiously waving a right arm to say give the ball to Ezzer. Arsenal have done that, here is Ezzer, Cross comes in, it's behind Yurka, it's comes to Trossard. Chessit down, hits it low, drags it well wide and is livid with himself. Goal kick for Fulham, here's Frani. Yeah, probably not the best of the finishes that we'll see from Trossard or his Arsenal teammates today. They've come out the traps, pretty sharp Arsenal putting Fulham on the back foot a little bit. But Kastania just positioned himself well, forcing him to shoot wide of the goal. Fulham have taken their goal kick, Leno inside his own six-yard box comes across the de-op. Fulham are all in white with black trim, black numbers on the back of their shirts, back heel volley pass, nearly came off for Jimenez, Kani was on the run but Ezzer ready for Arsenal. Calafiuri passes across to Zubemendi. Arsenal players missing at the moment, Erdogan, Maduweke, Gabriel J. Zoucin, Kai Havertz, and Capier has not involved today but is ready to go. So I wonder whether we'll see him in midweek against Atletico in the Champions League. Saka zooming into the Fulham penalty area, still going. Saka, oh the ball nearly crosses the line, scooped away by Kastania. It seems to have got away from Saka, he bundled his way through a couple of challenges. Somehow bobbled it past Leno and Fulham very grateful to Kastania, just getting there just in time. Yeah, and it was possessing you on, I think, just getting too tight, enabled Saka to just drop the shoulder and get away, but he drove so well into the box didn't he, as you say. Just got a little bit fortunate, there's a few little nervous bit of defending at the end but they've managed to clear it. Sander Berger, it would have been a Sander Berger own goal, it was Saka coming in on the angle, ran through one of the challenges and then just flipped the ball into that danger zone edge of the six yard box and Berger stuck a foot out and was heading across his own line before Kastania got there. Short corner to Trossard, back to Saka, on the right, chops onto his right foot, sliding challenge on him by Kastania, it goes behind for another Arsenal corner. I've got the feeling that Arteza's probably got into Arsenal a little bit half time, they've started sharply haven't they, second half. We were discussing our fair at half time Ali, weren't we, that you'd imagine Arteza would want his team to just sharpen things up a little bit, move the ball around the pitch a little bit better, a little bit sharper, a little bit quicker. Great view of the Arsenal players lurking at the far post here, waiting for this corner to come in from the right. Anthony Taylor is now ready for us to go, Saka decides the ball needs re-spotting, so steps towards it and places it carefully on the edge of the quadrant and stands with his feet apart. Arsenal fans behind him, jogs on the spot with his left foot, delivery is short, low into the near post, Kastania stoopes and heads the ball away and you've got all these giants lurking at the back post and Saka's got the ball nowhere near them. Poor delivery isn't it, clearly they're set up to do something that's either delivery's got to come middle of the goal or the far post and it was nowhere near there. David Ryre under pressure inside his own half, Gabriella stay forward in the attack, headed clear here to Berger for Fulham, forward to King, he's able to turn, King one on one against Saliba who's backing off, King still runs, passes to the left hand side, here's it, Wobie into the Arsenal penalty area, former Arsenal man looking for an opening, slides the pass across the face of the box, Harry Wilson onto it, edge of the area, slices the shot high and wide at the target and behind for the goal kick. Fulham nil, Arsenal nil, let's check in on the sprint race, it's the US Grand Prix tomorrow, sprint race tonight in Austin, Texas, here's Harry Benjamin. We're still catching our breath, Max Verstappen for Red Bull led the sprint race from pole all the way to the win with Landon, Orison, Oscar Piazza, both out at the first corner, he closes in for this championship battle, Verstappen takes the win ahead of George Russell and Carlos Sines, this is just the teaser, we've got Grand Prix qualifying coming up later on today. Yeah, that's on Sports Extra, coverage starts at 5-10 UK time in the Grand Prix on 5 live in full, our coverage starts at half 7 tomorrow. Lines are open for 6-06 tonight, that follows Fulham Arsenal, Fulham nil, Arsenal nil, 7 minutes gone in the second half, under the lights at Craven Cottage, such a distinctive footballing arena. Frani enjoyed his walk through the autumn colours of Bishops Park, to get here for the game this evening, Esers on the ball, passes low to his left, to Trossard, Trossard, corner of the Fulham box, looks for Esser again, 50-50 ball on the edge of the area, Kearney calmly passes it out looking for King, Saliva's there first, swings a right boot at the ball, knocks it back into his own half, Raya comes across to collect it, side-foot's a measured pass down the left to Rice, and Rice bouncing forward, jaunt in the stride, ball at his feet, inside the Fulham half, Arsenal looking for the breakthrough, Zubemendi, Fulham nil, Arsenal nil, Trossard turns, edge of the Fulham box, Califurian support on the left, high, looping cross to the far post, Saka does brilliantly well to control that, Sessignon's close by, Saka's cross is blocked, hits Sessignon, and Anthony Taylor says that to corner, assistant referee disagrees, he says that's a goal kick, and Anthony Taylor changes his mind and gives the goal kick. Producer George Frani was looking at the games Arsenal have played so far this season, and looking at the equivalent games last season, so Fulham for example, a team that Arsenal only drew against last season, newcastle they've beaten this season, away from home, last season they lost that game, if they win this game tonight, they will be seven points ahead against those equivalent games from last season, so in terms of dealing with tricky opponents, this is another one for them tonight, but it's not necessarily saying it's a sort of definite mission from Arsenal at the start of the season, but it shows you why they're in good shape. Of course, we spoke before the game how Arsenal have come out the traps and started extremely well this season, they'll be looking to certainly take maximum points here tonight, but Fulham have done an outstanding job so far in keeping them at bay, restricting them to pretty much half chances really, and you've got to credit them that, and that last effort from Wilson just goes to show how they can still be a threat. Fulham breaking play up on the edge of their own penalty area, Norwegian Sander Berger floats on forward, Saliba can't clear it, Jimenez under the ball for Fulham, Timber chasing back, Jimenez finds Wilson, edge of the area, scoop pass looking for Jimenez, Timber flicks a header away only as far as a woby, back it comes from Wilson, bolleys it over the bar, a flying wellsman at full stretch, got great contact on the ball, he couldn't keep it down, and look at 18 year old Joss King, loving the moment, whirling his arms around, giving him a little bit of a break, and he's going to be able to keep it down, and he's going to be able to keep it down, and he's going to be able to keep it down, and he's going to be able to keep it down, and he's going to be able to keep it down, and he's going to be able to keep it down, and he's going to be able to keep it down, and he's going to be able to keep it down, and he's going to be able to keep it down, and he's getting these Fulham fans behind their team, this game could go either way. Fullham, Arsenal, Niel. Saka has Sessignan. Andy Woby out there to try and look after him. They get it away from Saka. Now it's Woby on the ball for Fullham inside his own half. Passes back here to Sessignan. Has time to clear up towards the halfway line, Saliba nods it down. Kala united two. Forrest Green-Rover's two, so Robbie Savage is... Forrest Green-Rover's. They've equalised again in the national league. Robbie back on 6-0, 6-2 tomorrow. And Paul and Chris Sutton taking the calls tonight after this. There's Kala Fiori finding Zuba Mendi. Across to Timber. Timbers pass. Yoccarez takes it on the turn, stumbles forward. And Anthony Taylor, looking hard at that, immediately looks at Yoccarez and wags a finger. And you could tell, couldn't you there, Franny, that Cuenca had his hands full, and I think almost had to let Yoccarez go. But Yoccarez in the turn sort of loses his balance, doesn't... Ooh, stumbles. He's stuck a little... His left foot just almost goes to make a little bit of contact and tries to just intercept the ball a little bit. Yoccarez, I don't think there's enough... No. There's not enough for a penalty for me. It's good to call from Anthony Taylor. Yeah, good attempt from the centre forward to turn his man and nearly got away there. Could have tried to initiate the contact, possibly, and simulate the foul. He didn't do his credit really. He looked at Anthony Taylor, Anthony Taylor said, No, that's not a penalty. Yoccarez has picked himself up and carried on. Full of nil, Arsenal, nil. 11 minutes gone in the second half. Here's Zubemendi. Zubemendi's low pass out to Saka. Saka up against Iwobe. Saka flicks it in field to Ezra. Ezra, all shimmies and skills to Zubemendi. Back to Timber. Iwobe's got a hold of his right arm there, just to slow him down. Saliba to Zubemendi, prompting pass down the right. Timber thought about an early cross, decided against it. It's got Saka in field in the inside right channel. Good low ball finds Ezra. Ezra to Yoccarez, important sliding challenge there. On Yoccarez, it's gone behind for a corner, and Quenka is down. He's having a busy old game tonight. Fogay Quenka, he's made some really important blocks and interceptions, and Yoccarez, I think, might have just caught him. That's Quenka made the challenge. It was a dangerous looking attack, as soon as Ezra got on the ball. It was a short little pass, but Quenka's done so well. He's stood up. He's one headers when he's needed to. He's been one of those leading lights in the back line now. Just gets caught on that challenge, but he's stretched out a leg. Still 0-0, another Arsenal corner. The corner count is racking up, and it's the same old line-up. Although this time, Gabrielle, marked by two players, is on the penalty spot, tries to make a run for it in towards Gabrielle. Flick to header, Trossard's there. Volley's home from two yards out. Gabrielle, they tried to double mark him. He just can't handle him. He got the flick on the header. And Trossard celebrates his first Premier League goal of the season. Arsenal have the breakthrough, and as it stands, they're going three points clear at the top of the table. Fullham, then Arsenal won. We've seen how strong they can be from set pieces. And this time, the delivery spot on. It puts it into an area where it's asked questions of who's got the desire and determination to go and win the ball. And it was certainly Gabrielle there, wasn't it? As you say, there was players around him. It's just the slightest of touches, but it goes straight to the feet of Trossard. It's not even his foot, it's his thigh, isn't it? I think he needs it in almost. There's the slightest of touches, and then he just gets his thigh on it. And he's just the yard or two out, and he just helps it across the line. We see Nicolaated celebrating with his staff and his substitutes throwing his arms in the air. Game on. That tip of that again to Nicolaas Jova, set piece, coach much better delivery from Saka that time. Gabrielle did well. He ran through the two challenges really, just to make sure that ball was his and leapt beautifully to get the flick on. And he's celebrated for running almost as if he had scored the goal because he knew how important the role was he had played in the goal. That's so important to have players in the team like that, Ali. You're not the one that's maybe grabbing the headlines, as the goal scorer is, but you do something that contributes towards that in a big way. So Leandro Trossard's goals so far this season have come against Athletic Bill Bauer, Port Vale and Fulham, which is a heady mix. Rice side-foot to ball forward. Leno well outside his penalty area, right back position for him, clears it downfield, Zubemendi nods it forward, falls to Rice. Rice lofts it high in the air. Saka's going to try and get on the end of it, Sessigni on, heads it away, Flack goes up for an offside. The referee's going to say, wait here, goes up again now. And Ezzas pass into the penalty area, was intercepted anyway, so Fulham will get a free kick. So half an hour to play, just a little bit more than that. Fulham nil, Arsenal won. The Arsenal win will put them on 19 points ahead of Liverpool Manchester United tomorrow, which we have for you as a five-live commentary, kicking off at half-forward Amfield. We've also got Tottenham against Aston Villa in full at 2 o'clock, and then we're back into the Champions League football next week. Arsenal, Athletico is our commentary on Tuesday night. Chelsea against Ajax on Wednesday night. Rice, nice little cushion ball on the half volley. Yocarez chases this down the left-hand side, Fulham possibly vulnerable now. Trailing Arsenal by goal to nil. Arsenal looking for a first win here in three seasons. Here's the goal scorer, Crossard, teases Kastanya, flips the cross in, straight into the arms of Leno, who makes a very comfortable catch, and he's going to hoof the ball straight out of play because Kearney's down again. Tom Kearney received treatment a couple of times in the first half, was he making the symbol there? For him tonight, I think. I think the way he's crouched down, he's pointing at his... It seemed to be like the bottom of his neck, in between his shoulder blades when he was getting treatment earlier, Ali, wasn't it? So he's clearly got a problem there. Something that's going to take him out of the game by the looks of it, and they're going to have to make a change for him. 34-years-old Tom Kearney, as I said in the first half, in his 11th season at the club here. First Premier League start of the season, and you always see it from... Football is desperate to play, hard to get into the team, has his opportunity tonight, and then frustrated by injury. Nice story coming now, though, another former Arsenal man, Emile Smith-Rowe, who's not got the starts for Fulham this season, continually coming off the bench, who has played in every Premier League game, but only as a sub every time. And I can see Mikael Marino is waiting to come on for Arsenal. He has scored eight goals in his last eight games for Spain. Got two in the 4-0 win against Bulgaria this week. Obviously has played as a makeshift centre-forward for Arsenal, and he will come on for Eberechi Ezra. So Ezra gets a break, Marino comes on, that adds a bit of sort of brisk strength and toughness to the Arsenal midfield. What do you think, Franny Longtime? I know it's early to call it, because we're only talking about eight Premier League games played, but in terms of... We've seen Arsenal finish second, second and second. Do you think they're in an even better position this season to go one step further and win that Premier League title for the first time in over 20 years? They're going to be in the mix for sure, Ali. With the start that they've made, they're giving themselves the best chance possible. As all of us know, there's such a long way to go, and so much twists and turns, and that rollercoaster of, what's going to happen between now and the end of the season, but it's the outstanding start they've had already. It's the strength and depth that they've got within the squad now, the players that they've signed, the experience of coming runners-up in the last past three seasons, just all adds to the mix to, potentially for me, be this is the season quite possibly. Right, double change for Fulham. Emil Smith-Rowe comes on for Tom Kearney, and Kevin comes on for Josh King. Now that will change things up a bit. Kevin is the 22-year-old Brazilian fleet of foot, signed from Shakhtar for £35 million this summer, only substitute appearances in the Premier League so far this season, but I think Fulham fans have really enjoyed what they've seen so far, and Merino on for Ezzer, so those are the changes back underway. That's clever from Trossard. Back heel to Saka, Saka edge of the parents, little nutmeg, shot! Well, great save from Leno, rebound nearly fell to Jocerez, just behind him. Leno might have been unsighted there, got down well to his left, and prevented it from going 2-0 to Arsenal. 18 minutes gone in the second half. Number to dial for 6-0-6 tonight, Aaron Paul and Chris Sutton are waiting to take the calls. 0-8, 0-8-5, 9-0-9, 6-9-3. I was talking about those players that have scored four or more goals in a Premier League game. Chris Sutton is not one of those. Koko did it for Norwich, Everton. I think Chris claims for any that he set up all four. Never the unselfish assist there, doesn't he, Chris? Declan Rice with the diagonal ball. Arsenal going looking for a second to make things more comfortable here. He's going to take on Kevin, beats Kevin. Saka's in the mood. Oh, that's a wild challenge. That's a penalty. Crazy challenge from Kevin. Had a wild lash out at Saka. Saka's down flat on the floor edge of the box. VAR will have a look at this, but Anthony Taylor had a clear view. The only question will be here. Franny is whether it's inside the penalty area or not. I think it was. It was very tight and we'll get an opportunity, hopefully, to see it again. But it's a big challenge to make when he's not really needs to. He gets a slight touch. The slightest of touch with his right boot, as his foot's coming back down, almost like the sole of his boot, gets that connection with the ball. And I think that's going to be the big call in what VAR will look at and make out that it is a legitimate challenge. You're right. You're right. He's got the ball. I was absolutely convinced from here. I mean, Anthony Taylor was convinced, wasn't he? And in real time, I think it does look like a foul, clearly. He's lucky, though, don't you think? That's a crazy challenge. It's the slightest of margins. He starts on the ball. That's the famous Ian Smith commentary line, isn't it, from the... England's winning the cricket World Cup under the barest of margins. You're right. That is the barest of margins. It's almost the tip of his toe as well, isn't it? The front of his boot. If it was a size 7 like me, I would have missed it and it would have been a pen. I've got bigger feet than you, for me. One of the very few people who have bigger feet. They're having a long, long look at this. VAR today, Stuart Atwell. I mean, he's going to get lucky here. That's not a clever challenge in front of you. You shouldn't be doing that. It's a risky one, certainly, isn't it? I get the enthusiasm and the determination to go and win a challenge and a tackle and put a player under pressure, but you're asking the referee with a challenge like that to make a decision. Anthony Taylor is being sent to the screen. He's given it as a penalty on the field. Stuart Atwell now thinks it possibly isn't. He's had 9, 10 looks at the slow motion here. The screen is now being erected in front of Anthony Taylor at the bottom of the riverside stand. How many looks is he going to need? There's a little kid in a film shirt who's shrugging his shoulders and saying to Anthony Taylor, what do you reckon? What is it going to be? For the first time we've seen it, I think there's connection. I don't see how it takes this long, to be honest, to make a decision. Well, Anthony Taylor is the on-field referee. I think it's right that he does have a look, doesn't he? Rather than the decision being made to sort of part. At the moment, he's looking at a paused picture. I think he needs to see a little bit more than that. I mean, that is the paused picture. It's the other angle. It's the reverse angle looking back where he gets the touch. They've got to show him that. That is the difference. Four different pictures now, Anthony Taylor has. A split screen from different angles of the Kevin challenge on Bacchio Sacca. Well, none of those are going to show anything. No. Ali, to be honest, they need to show the slow motion. Retray. Still waiting. You can see a steward over there just trying to calm some of the full-on fans down. Anthony Taylor, there we go. Now he's finally seeing what we've seen three or four times. There's the touch on the ball. The slightest of touches as well, isn't it? Yeah. But it's a touch, and that's what, for me, makes all the difference. Yeah. Rocking and rolling. Rocking and rolling. Back we go, forward we go. And again, this little kid is having time with his life. He's going to star on Match The Day tonight. Michel Arteta is now in the fourth official's ear, complaining about how long this is taking. I think contact on ball before Sacca's shin. But Leno shakes his head. Right, Anthony Taylor takes his time. He's moved away from the screen. And at the moment, he's not signalling what he's going to do just yet. Full of 22 makes a talent. He plays the ball. Then a good one comes in. He takes it, takes it, takes it. He's got a good one. There's the voice of Anthony Taylor. He plays the ball. Kevin played the ball. No penalty. So it fooled us. It fooled Anthony Taylor. They've had a long, long look at that. It's taken an awfully long time. Is that the right decision in the end, Freddie? That's the key thing. 100%. It's the right decision. It takes a long time. It only takes one or two glimpses at the footage to know that he's got the slightest of touches, regardless of seeing Sacca thinks otherwise. And many of the Arsenal supporters and Nikolá Teta does too, I'm sure, but it's a risky challenge. It's very questionable, but it is a touch on the ball, so it's no penalty. Kevin on the ball now for Fulham. Just over 20 minutes to play, plus a fair bit of added time. Fulham, they'll ask for one. It will be. Brings the ball down inside the penalty area, plays it back to Kostan, Cross comes in, diving header away from Gabrielle. Cesson, you're on chest sit down, goes back into his own half. Goal in the game between Kilmarnock and Hartz. Can he crawl for it? 57 minutes gone. Kilmarnock, Nel Hartz too. Kilmarnock gave it away 30 yards out. Kizzeri decided to short. Eddie Beach saved that one, but the rebound failed to Claudio Braga, the Portuguese, and he put it in from 10 yards for the seventh of the season. Kilmarnock, Nel Hartz too. Iwobi charging forward for Fulham. Here's Harry Wilson on the right-hand side. Moves infield, Califuri sticks with him, gives it to Iwobi, back to the Welshman Wilson again. Side-footed pass across to the giant figure of Sander Berger. Smith Rowe, former gunner on the ball for Fulham. White to Cessignon, back to Smith Rowe with the light blonde hair, swept across his forehead into the feet of Iwobi. Rowe ball into the box, Cessignon can't take it on the turn. Build-up was great from Fulham there. It's gone behind for the goal kick. It remains Carlisle United 2, Forest Green Rovers 2 in the National League. The reason I'm focusing on that one is two former Welsh internationals going head-to-head in Mark Hughes and Robbie Savage, and it's Sutton United 2, Hartleypool United 2. Chris Sutton, the link there, hosting 606 tonight with Aaron Paul. Lines are open, numbered a dial, 08085 909 693. And it's very much still game on at Craven Cottage. Trossard's low cross-in, edge of the box, complete miscue from Marino, falls to Yocarez. Yocarez outside of his right foot finds Trossard, makes the outside run, crosses into the far post, Leno stretches and grabs the ball with both hands, runs out to the edge of the penalty area. It's funny how incidents like that, silly challenge by Kevin, looked to penalty all day long, was and can turn again, funny. Well, look how it's changed the reaction from the supporters, Ali. The decision going their way, which is the correct decision, as we see it, it's just giving them a little lift and the players on the pitch are responding to that. Just on 7 o'clock this Saturday night, Premier League highlights available on the i-player from 8 o'clock match of the day tonight, BBC One at half 10. Here's Smith Rowe, playing the ball back to Berger forward. It goes to Iwoobi, full of moving at pace, white shirt streaming forward, Declan Rice, sticks a left arm out, wants cover behind him, Kostania is there wide on the right, gets the pass back to Iwoobi, little cross into the near post, Rice got to be careful, bounces in front of him, watches it all the way into his chest, grabs it with both hands, and then very gently rolls the ball out under onto Zubemendi. First time layoff from Rice is back to Trossard. Trossard's whose goal separates the two teams and Kostania backs off his fellow Belgian here, so Trossard brings it up to the corner of the box and he's got Wilson in Iwoobi in front of him. This time he plays the pass to Rice, stands on the ball for a second, then caresses a low pass to Saliba, out wide it goes to Timber, back to Saliba, across to Rice and Arsenal start to move full of them around. And Fulhamer's still got to chase it if they want something from the game. Trossard does well to keep that ball in play. Eventually it's knocked out by Iwoobi, throwing to Arsenal on the left, who will want that second goal, that cushion, just to make sure of this game, make sure of the three points, get themselves three points clear at the top of the Premier League table. At a ground where the last couple of seasons, as I said in the first half, they've not won and Fulhamer have been awkward for them. Campreel, left-footed ball, crosses his own half to Saliba, Zubemendi in goal, back to Saliba again. Saliba looking right and left, another goal at Kilmarnock, Kenny Crawford. 61 minutes gone, another Hart's goal, another Claudio Braga goal, Hart's three, great work by Qasaritas to set him up. Over to Braga, he rounded the goalkeeper beach and thumped in in front of 3,900 visiting Hart's fans. Kilmarnock now Hart's three. So a Hart's win, we're taking to 22 points, Celtic on 17, Celtic at Dundee tomorrow in the lunchtime kickoff, long ball downfield, Saka can't quite control it, Kevin's lost it, Tim were in field to Saka, didn't find his man with the pass, burger onto the ball for Fulhamer, Iwoobi's running ahead of him, the ball hit his heels, Smith-Rowe, Iwoobi's in space again on the right, Fulham fans are encouraged, just over 15 minutes to play. Kostanio makes the overlapping run, Iwoobi takes it in field, runs out of options, plays back to D'Obb, cross it goes to Quenca, back to D'Obb, forward to Iwoobi, Kostanio in space again on the right, Calafiori shuts that down, back it comes to Iwoobi again, Iwoobi with his left foot, strikes a delicious pass across field to Quenca. Right it comes here to Cessignon, Cessignon driving run forward, the ball ends up at the feet of Wilson, Trossard makes the challenge, Anthony Taylor wanted to play the advantage, Fulham get the free kick and they take it quickly, Iwoobi sees space on the left, good ball, here's Kevin, what can he do with the ball at his feet, running at Timber, onto his right foot, cross comes in, Gabrielle does really well with the header to prevent Jimenez getting there, D'Obb leans into a challenge over the back of Yurkarez, and that is considered a foul, asked him to get the free kick, but he's running but Ali. Yeah, the game's certainly liven up now, Ali, isn't it? Supporters have realised what's at stake for the remaining minutes, but both sides really taking the game and sort of up in the tempo, the pace, and Fulham are really still pushing, that was a little bit of a question, just in a replay of Gabrielle's header that he won, he's got his left arm around Jimenez's neck, is there enough for a penalty? I don't think so, but he's a good header, but it shows Fulham are still a threat, Arsenal certainly would like the comfort of a second goal to make this an easier three points. Talking about explaining VAR decisions, I mean it was explained by Anthony Taylor over the loudspeaker inside the stadium here, but we have a written explanation on the big screen at either end at Craven Cottage, basically making the point that Kevin played the ball, which is why Arsenal didn't get their penalty. We're waiting for the game to restart, David Ryder is going to do that with a free kick to Arsenal, seven or eight yards outside his own penalty area, number to dial for 6-0-6 is 0-8-0-8-5, 9-0-9, 6-9-3, the lines are open. Ange Kostakoglu is sacked by Nottingham Forest today. Roberto Mancini is another name I've seen mentioned in a BBC Sport article on the BBC Sport website this evening, Sean Dysh's name is there, Marco Silva's name, Fulham Boss has been thrown in as well. Nottingham Forest have Porto at home on Thursday in the Europa League and then away to Bournemouth as well, so fixtures don't get any easier. Arsenal leading here 1-0, Fulham have want to throw, Raul Jimenez runs behind Michel Arteta to get to the ball, Wilson is onto this on the right, Califiore's followed him out there, Wilson with the long dark hair tied back has given it away, that's a foul on Yocarez, Arsenal get a free kick inside their own half, Fulham just lost their composure at the crucial moment there. I was just thinking how well Harry Wilson has been doing and having a real decent game, he's been full of energy for sure, but just a little stray pass there, little sloppiness, maybe fatigue is just starting to kick in a little bit now at this stage of the game. By the way, one other sport I haven't mentioned today, if you're a fan of Sumo, the grand Sumo tournament taking place at the Royal Albert Hall, you can watch on the iPlayer, BBC Sport website and app at 7.30 tonight, there was an item on the national news last night, it showed them all the wrestlers arriving at Heathrow Airport. I think I did see absolutely enormous, as you'd expect. Oh, good challenge by Kevin here on Saliba, Kevin still on the floor, gets to his feet, fouled by Zubemendi, Fulham fans love that, free kick for Fulham, Fulham, they're Arsenal won in the 78th minute of the game and Michel Arteta knows how good his defence is, just how many clean sheets they have kept so far this season, but of 1-0, still dangerous. It's always in question, isn't it? You know, it's such a tight game, but you know, they've got the belief, they've got the confidence of keeping games tight, keeping clean sheets, but Fulham also, you saw the spring in the defenders' boots to get up into the 18-yard box, Diop, especially they'll be looking to get on the end of this delivery. Fulham set piece, free kick from deep, Harry Wilson into the far post, ball drops inside the box, Diop is there, lays it back to Smith Rowe, back to Iwobi. 30 yards out, Trossard comes to challenge him, Iwobi beats him, gives it to Smith Rowe, Ryathawd about coming for the cross, doesn't do so. Saliba wins the header for Arsenal, Saka leaps, just knocks a little header down to himself and his bright green brutes, clears the ball down the right to Yocca as he wants a physical battle here with Cessignon. Backs into him, Cessignon gets the ball, clears it away, Saliba volleys it forward and Iwobi has come all the way back to cover the Arsenal counter, gets on the ball inside his own half, runs it up to the halfway line, plays it to Costania, back to Iwobi and Iwobi goes across to the left to Cuenca. 12 minutes plus added time, remaining. Just shows you, Ali, doesn't it? You know, Fulham have been very much in this game through the entire match so far and it's just been that one set piece, doesn't it? Just the importance that everyone makes about the difference that that can make in these kind of games. 15 Premier League goals for Arsenal so far this season, five of them from open play, ten from either corners, throw-ins or penalties. I think it's seven corners they've now scored and that makes your point. Exactly, and it just shows how important it is. We see teams now even refusing to take quick throw-ins when it's almost like level with the 18-yard box. They just put it into the box. Saka looking for the ball through to Yocarez, couldn't find him. Fulham trying to turn it into a counter of their own. Going into end now, Jimenez, long ball looking for Wilson trying to run off the back of Gabrielle. Gabrielle climbs, flicks ahead to his left, Ryder plays it out to Calafiori. The more Fulham come at Arsenal, the more open it will leave them to Arsenal sealing this game with a second goal, but they are offering an attacking threat themselves on their home patch and the Fulham fans will not let them go down quietly. It's Gabrielle, cross to Rice. Franny said it right at the side of the game. One nil to the Arsenal potentially, Yocarez backing into Cuenca. Still Yocarez, always smashed it over the bar. He did so well to fight for that ball and make the chance for himself and then the moment came seven yards out and he's launched it into that puttney end away to our left-hand side. Well, he won't want to see this again, will he? He gets a little bit fortunate. He muscles his defender out. He just blasts it high, doesn't he? Maybe just snatches at it a little bit. Got him in the fantasy team, Franny. I've gone for him instead of Saka. Well, there you go. That's why it happened. Come on, Victor. Anidia, buy-in to Borussia Dortmund nil. Michael Alise has scored the second. Cain and Alise with the two goals for Bayern Munich this evening. Gabrielle Martinelli on the field for Arsenal. I was just looking at the latest from the Bundesliga and he has come on for Trossard, the goal scorer. Fulham nil Arsenal won into the last ten minutes. Gabrielle heads it forward. High ball drops just inside the fulham half. Saka clips it forward with his left boot. Quencher is there, thumps it up in the air. Awkward one for Saliba, under pressure from Kevin trying to get the ball on the floor. Jimenez moves in to make a tackle, comes off the Mexican, goes out for a throw into Arsenal. Adama Triore is getting stripped off and ready to come on. Calvin Bassi is coming on as well. So Bassi on for Quencher. Quencher has put himself about this evening, hasn't he, Franny? Yeah, I've been impressed with him. He's very solid, hasn't he? He's a big physical presence back there. He's won some important headers, some important challenges. Just getting that little fresh legs and seeing Wilson going off another one. That's put a huge shift in today. If you're a tiring Arsenal defender, and you see this fella, Adama Triore bouncing onto the field, you're thinking, how long have we got to go here? Nine minutes plus added time. Calla Fiori, I think will relish this challenge for Arsenal. Defensively the best in the business, leading 1-0, set-piece goal, Saka's corner flicked on by Gabrielle, finished by Trossard at close range. Martin Ellies made some important contributions from the bench this season already for Arsenal. He's playing wide left. Saka stays on the field wide right. Rice finds him with the high diagonal pass. Ball is played back to the halfway line to Saliba. Saliba to Saka. Saka comes zooming in field, finds Marino. He's got a woe be breathing down his neck. Back it comes to Zubemendi across to Rice. Rice lays it off to Martin Ellies. Keeps going with his run to the edge of the box. Martin Ellies plays it back to Calla Fiori, crosses to Zubemendi. Timbers making a good run in space in the box. Chests it down, ball bounces in front of him, delays the cut back here, still waiting. Scoot ball, overhead kick from Martin Ellies. Arsenal appeal for a handball. Hoisted up in the air there by Bassey over his own bar. Referee's just going to say wait. Just going to say wait so that VAR can have a look at what happened there. Full amount of waiting to take a goal kick. And we're going to see for any weather. Martin Ellies, overhead kick has been illegally blocked. Bassey's left arm down by a side. I don't think so. I think he's got his thigh. It was close. I don't think it has struck his arm. Good call. Spot on. Franny Benali, form a Southampton defender with us here at Craven Cottage tonight. Says no penalty. VAR Anthony Taylor agree. I think. No, we're not back underway just yet. Let's wait and see. We are still checking. OK. Ah, now is that D-Op on the Yucca res we're looking at? Yeah, they're having a look at that as well. No, and they've waved that away too. So, game is back underway. It was just a little wrestling match going on there, wasn't there? Yep. 84th minute of the game. Five live in BBC Sounds. 6-0-6 follows. Martin Ellie speeding away down the left up against Kostania and Iwobi. Martin Ellies slips over as he tries to pass the ball between the pair of them. Here's Iwobi. Cross to Berger. Berger runs it past Marino inside his own half. Can Fulham summon something late on to peg Arsenal back and deny them again at Craven Cottage. Beat them here two seasons ago under Marco Silva, who has actually beaten Arsenal in charge of four different clubs. Coming with Olympia Arcos, Watford, Everton and Fulham. Tonight though, is Fulham team are behind. Fulham near Arsenal one. Arsenal come looking for the second. Here's Timber on the right. Passing towards Yocca res, it wouldn't stick. He tried to hold that up on the edge of the box. Cessignon has it. Yocca res goes chasing, puts Bassi under pressure. Clearance is deflected off Yocca res' boot, chested down there by Zubemendi. Kevin has it for Fulham. Scoops a risky ball back towards his own penalty area. Yocca has nearly got that. Fulham clear to the halfway line. Arsenal work it into the feet of Gabrielle, just inside his own half looking for runners coming towards him. And Arsenal still look so strong. Rice to the left to Calafiori. Last five minutes of the game plus added time. Good step over there to leave the ball for Marino. Martin, Ellie and Marino on the same way that Sacher is screaming for the ball in space on the right and he's not going to get it. Zubemendi to Rice. Fulham are now back in their defensive shape so that ball to Sacher's not on but Saliba's going to go looking for him. Sacher can't control it. He is fuming, Franny, because the ball should have come a lot earlier, shouldn't it? Yeah, certainly did. You know, the midfielders just turned out and came back the other way again but it wasn't a great ball to Sacher, was it? It was a difficult one for him to control at the end there. But Fulham, you've got to give them some credit. They've certainly worked their socks off in this game to make it a game against Arsenal and it's been extremely difficult given their resources. Dortmund have a goal back against Bayern Munich. Bayern 2, Dortmund 1, Julian Brandt has scored that. Here's Kevin taking on Timber who got the last touch there. Anthony Tatis' corner to Fulham. Sacher was back helping the defending. Sacher and Timber against Kevin. Something a bit special about Kevin actually and Fulham fans have immediately taken him to their hearts. Come on, Fulham. It's the chart you can hear ringing round Craven Cottage. 87th minute now. Arsenal still leading. Corner for Fulham and it comes. Whip on that. Califuri leaps high and heads the ball away. Arsenal's defensive resolve is being tested once more. We've got commentary on Arsenal's game in the Champions League on Tuesday night. We're at home to Atlético. We've got Chelsea Ajax commentary for you on Five Live on Wednesday night. As this long throw comes into the Arsenal penalty area, Gabrielle has headed that as high as a goal kick. Sacher's down edge of his own box. Cessignol ran into him. There was a collision. Sacher's down hurt. Arsenal get the free kick. Marquis Carlisle leads Robbie Savages' Forest Green 3-2 and Hartley pulls 3-2 up the way to Sutton. A couple of five goal-thrillers in the evening kick-offs in the National League. And just a reminder tomorrow, two commentators on Five Live and BBC Sounds. BBC Sounds is what you need on your device if you're on the move and you want to listen to us. And not just us, but you've got all the BBC radio stations on there, including our extra sports streams, Sports Extra 2 and 3. Tottenham Villa at 2 tomorrow and Liverpool Manchester United, which still has such a resonance to it as a football fixture in this country. The two teams who both won 20 top flight titles each go head-to-head at Anfield tomorrow at half four. John Murray and Stephen Warrick with the commentary. Arsenal trying to close this out. Sacher's on the ball. Seems determined to do it himself. His pass through his block. Supermendi. Clever pass. Hooks it over his shoulder. Finds Yocarez in the right-wing position. Back to Supermendi. Back heel from Sacher looking for Supermendi. Slight intelligent passy corner for Arsenal. And it would be just like Arsenal, Franny, to seal this with a second goal from a set-piece. Well, it took a corner from exactly the same spot before to get the goal that's winning the game so far. Just seeing whether this was actually a goal kick or not. Oh, no, you're right. Goal kick has come off Supermendi's foot. That's his appeal for it, but the officials have got it wrong. We'll see if it costs Fulham even more. Yeah, Fulham had some tough calls go against him this season. That game they lost at Stanford Bridge in particular. They're one nil down here. This should not have been a corner. Slight touch from Supermendi's foot. Anyway, let's see what Arsenal can do with it. Arsenal players in the dark blue shirt start to make their run. Sacher's delivery looks dangerous. Flicked onto the far post. Gabriel's going to let it bounce. Try and get his body in the way. Jimenez is there. Noxit passed Martinelli. Saliba's got it covered. He's happy to hoof it into the stands. Goes out for a throw. Jimenez wanted to take it quickly. He's five yards further forward from where he should have been. Throws it back here to Diop. He's immediately under pressure from Yoccarez. 89th minute of the game. Fulham, the last nor one. 6-0-6 is on the way. If you want to have a chat with Aaron Paul and Chris Sutton tonight. 0-8-0-8-5. 9-0-9. 6-9-3 is the number to dial. Bassi. A little pass to Berger. Back to the goalkeeper Leno. Leno, slightly loose touch in his own six-yard box. Arsenal players closing in on the press here. Fulham have done well. Berger's pass to the right. Fainzi Wobbe. Declan Rice. What the effort he's putting in to try and get back to cover this run from Wobbe. He just gets his body in front of him to slow it down. Triori, first touch of the evening. Takes on Calafiori. Still going. Heading for the bi-lung. Wins Fulham. The corner. They're asking questions at the right time. Ali, they've certainly been in this game. Albeit falling behind to that goal from the set piece from Arsenal. They're going to give themselves an opportunity to try and get back on level terms. You can see what they've been difficult to play against here at Craven Costins this season. Fulham fans on their feet at the Hammersmith end away to our right. Kevin takes the corner. High away, swinging to the far post. Volley Deppert takes it to the flexion. Can Arsenal now attack on the counter? Marino lofts it up in the air. Montanelli jump powerfully to win that ball on the half way line. And we have got nine minutes of added time. Fulham have got the ball back to Leno. Quickly worked it forward now to Kevin. He takes it on the turn in the inside right channel. Nine minutes and a load of that was deciding whether it was a penalty or not. Of course, a huge amount of that was. We've had a couple of injuries, few stoppages. But VAR certainly taken up a big chunk of that nine minutes. Still one-nil Arsenal. Win tonight, they're three points clear at the top of the Premier League. Treyorro has it on the right. Declan Rice is in his way. Little step over. Treyorro's got into the penalty area now. Rice has got to be careful. Follows him down to the byline. Flicks the right foot out. Treyorro gets it back to Kostan. Cross comes in. Arsenal deal with that for now. It bounces in front of Basi. 40 yards out. Knots it towards Berger. Berger side-foot to pass here. Up towards the edge of the penalty area. Sessignal controls. Plays it back to Basi. He doesn't see an option for Fulham. Under pressure here from Saka. Turns away from him. Low pass down the left. Smith throws in. Looking for a 1-2. Fulham keeping it alive for now. Basi across to Berger. And Arsenal's defenders having to cover the yards. Berger low sweeping pass. Fines Treyorro. They're looking for him every time. Beats Calafiore. Running across the edge of the box. Trying to set himself up for the shot. Little step over. Turns. Goes to the right-hand side. Here's Iwobi. Still inside that Arsenal area. Couple of step-overs. Martenleli's in front of him. Down with the byline. He goes and then knocks it too far. Can't get the crossing on the slide. That's why Arsenal keep so many clinches. They're so difficult to get past. They're hard to break down aren't they? You know, it's good defending from the Arsenal players. But Fulham, you've got to give them credit as well. They've certainly not sort of just sat back and tried to just keep Arsenal at bay. They've really asked some questions. They've stepped up the game once they've had to. And you've got to say that the remaining minutes, there's still enough time to get a goal back. Seven minutes of added time remaining. Then we'll wrap everything up for you. Then we're going to hand it over to Aaron Paul and Chris Sutton. We'll definitely want to talk tonight to Nottingham Forest fans about the sacking of Ange Poster Goglu just over 20 minutes after the 3-0 home defeat against Chelsea in the lunchtime kickoff. 39 days in charge, eight games, no wins. What do you think, Forest fans? And who would you like to see next through the door? Number to dial 08085909693. Arsenal at the moment leading Fulham 1-0 at Craven Cottage. Sessing on the ball inside his own half. Chips it forward. Zubemendi challenges Kevin. Zubemendi's knocked it out of play for a full-and-throw. Three minutes of the nine minutes of added time have ticked away. So Fulham have got six minutes here to try and find themselves an equaliser. If they don't and lose the game, that will be three defeats in a row for them. Next up, Newcastle away next Saturday at 3 o'clock. And then they go to Wickham in the league playing for a place in the quarterfinals. Here's Gabrielle back to Ryan. Arsenal trying to hold on to the ball to see this out. The Ryre actually is going to go long downfield. Yocarez will chase. Basi will head it away, only as far as Martinelli, who's in the middle portion of the pitch here inside the Fulham half. See Saka in space on the right. Yocarez is trotting into position in the middle. Saka slides a little pass into the feet of Yocarez, turns, shoots. Leno comes it away. Martinelli shoots. And Leno on the floor makes another save, knocked it behind corner for Arsenal. Robin Arlie. Dangerous attack from Arsenal. Looking bright and Yocarez doing well. Link up plays back to play. He's done very well. He gets a shot away, but not for the first time today. Leno has made some important saves for Fulham. Right, another Arsenal corner. Looking for a second goal that will win the game, kill Fulham off, and make it safe tonight. Four minutes of added time played, five minutes still to go. Same old routine. Saka with his left foot from the right-hand side, whole clutch of dark blue shirts in that six-yard box. Here comes Saka, left-footed delivery, edge of the six-yard box. Gabriel gets the flick on only as far as Imenez. Takes one touch on the laces of his right boot, slices the clearance away. Ry has miles of his penalty area, slices that up in the air. Awkward one for him. Kevin was putting him under pressure. Raul Jimenez wouldn't get a job in the England cricket team. Obviously not, because he's Mexican. He wouldn't get a job in the Mexican cricket team, because he's dropped that and long off. Spilled it twice, and it delayed. Fulham restarting the game as quickly as they wanted to. By the way, Monday nightclub on Monday night with Mark Chapman is followed by five-live cricket hour, in which Michael Vaughn, Glenn McGraw, and Phil Tuffin are picking their best Ashes 11. Ashes not too far away now. Here's Jimenez. Jimenez turns inside the Arsenal half, back to Iwoobi. Iwoobi looking for tri-aureate. God, the flick behind his legs had so much power on it. Wiz past Kostanio went out for the throw into Arsenal. They were quite happy now to slow everything down. And we've got another change coming for Arsenal. Victor Yocaras, how do you think he's done tonight, Freddie? So that's now nine games for club and country without a goal. 16, 15, no. What do you make of his performance tonight? He plays a key role. Get what Nikola Tessa does say about him. Yes, they want goals from him. He'll be disappointed that he hasn't scored today. There's that one in the second half here where he's ballooned the chance over high over the bar, probably his best chance. He works so hard up front for them, doesn't he? He's a good little link player if the ball comes into his body. He'll be disappointed not to score, but I'm sure the goals will come. Going to be playing a lot of minutes, too. Havertz still out, Jézus still out. Obviously, Mikael Moreno can do the job. He's playing the ball back to his goalkeeper. Three minutes, just a little bit more remaining. 6-0-6 on the way, five live in BBC Sounds. Arsenal leading one-nil at Craven Cottage. Bassie's long ball aimed towards Traore. Gabrielle wins the header and he's taken a knock into the small of his back, but he continues play. Traore turns away from Califari. Had a hold of his shirt there, I thought, no. Anthony Taylor says no free kick. Rice, powerful run inside his own half, runs into trouble, gives the ball away. Burger to Traore. He tries to win it back. Arsenal do have it back, and then Califari goes down so easily there. Traore topples over him, play continues, full of habits. Smith-Rose now down. Jimenez running into the Arsenal penalty area. Angle's got almost impossible. Oh, Gabrielle's knocked him over the dead ball line there. And Jimenez flat on his back, and eventually it's cleared away by Christian Norgaard, who's come on for Victor Yocarez. And we have played almost seven minutes of the nine minutes of added time. Two minutes to go. Gabrielle and Jimenez could have quite easily injured him. He saw him holding his shoulder or moving his shoulder from the fold that he took. It's just one of those contacts where he lent into him as he played the ball. Yeah, he's off balance, trying to get that cross in from the dead ball line. And Gabrielle's just given sort of leaned into him, just pushed him, and he slammed his shoulder into the advertising holdings behind the goal. Last two minutes of the game, got a full on fans, and the Johnny Haines stand don't think it's going to happen for Fulham. They're heading for the exits. Ball is down inside the Fulham half. Carlisle four, Forrest Green two, so Mark Hew's getting a bit of a Robbie Savage in the national leagues, and Sutton have equalised against Hartley Poole. Come on, the cracking game. Sutton three, Hartley Poole three. Both games kicked off at half five like this one. Gabrielle's ball over the top. Martinelli tried to control it on the right instep. Difficult one to do, flies off his boot and goes out for a throw into Fulham in the right back position. Minute and ten seconds remaining. And Arsenal will not care how the three points come at the moment they're coming from. The Trossard close range finish. Saka to Merino. Can they find a second right at the end? Here's Saka again, edge of the Fulham box, back to goal. Drawing defenders in, ah, does so well. Gives it to Zubemendi, cut back into the penalty area, and it goes out for an Arsenal corner. So, Farny's just put the current Premier League table in front of me. If Arsenal win this game, 19 points from eight games. Manchester City on 16 from eight, and Liverpool on 15 from seven. Manchester United tomorrow at half four, full commentary on five live. And Bournemouth three, three at Palace today, 15 from eight games. What an incredible season they're having. Tottenham on 14, actually, and they're at home to Villa tomorrow. Arsenal are going to kill time now. They've taken the corner short. Saka's going to try and hold on to the ball by the corner flag. It's a right old stromash down there. White shirts, blue shirts, feet kicking out of the ball, and it's eventually gone behind. No, not behind, if I could pardon. It's gone out for a throw in to Arsenal. They're 10 seconds away from another Premier League win, and that's the loudest I've heard the fans this evening. The red and white flags are waving in the putty end away to our left. They believe this season could be Arsenal's season. Bakao Saka roars at the Arsenal fans on the full-time whistle. Declan Rice joins in as well. They've had to work really hard for that win tonight. It's come from a set-piece goal. Saka's corner flicked on by Gabrielle and finished by Leandro Trossard. But you can see from that post-match reaction, Franny Bernali, how hard that was, how much it means, and actually how important they know every single point is going to be this season if they're going to win the Premier League. We spoke beforehand, Ali, didn't we, about with respect to Fulham, these are the kind of games where they have to turn up, they've got to put a performance in, and they've got to come away with the maximum points if they want to have those hopes of winning the Premier League this season. It certainly wasn't easy. Fulham have made it extremely hard for them. They were hard to break down. They offered stuff going forward as well. Especially given that you look at the difference between the two clubs, the spending power, the players that they can attract Arsenal, the players that come off the substitutes bench. It's a big difference, so you've got to give credit to Fulham. They're a tough side to come up against. And as we said in the comms, that set-piece was the big difference on the night. Aaron Paul and Chris Sutton waiting to take the calls on 6-0-6. I know Chris is going to love producer George's stats, so I hope he's listening, against the equivalent opponents last season. So the equivalent games last season, Arsenal are now already seven points better off than the points they got from these games last season. The season has started well for them. They are a definite bonded unit, standing over there all together as a club. Players, coaching staff, manager Mikel Arteta just moves away. They celebrate the win with their fans right now. We're handing you over to 6-0-6 shortly. Let's check in on the Scottish premiership, though. 5-45 kickoff tonight. Leaders' hearts at the start of the evening away to kill Monarchy as Kenny Crawford. 89 minutes gone. Come on up, Nell. Arsenal's hearts three, so as it stands, Derek McKinnis' visitors are going to go five points clear at the top of the premiership with Celtic, not playing Dundee until tomorrow. Convincing performance, Halcet and a Braga brace with the goals. It's come on up now. Hearts three with a few minutes of added time to go. Arsenal three points clear at the top of the Premier League table and Poster Coglu, sacked by Nottingham Forest today. So much to react to on 6-0-6 this evening. What a game at Selhurst Park as well. Crystal Palace three, Bournemouth three. Aaron Paul and Chris Sutton waiting to take your calls on 6-0-6. Here tonight at Craven Cottage, it has finished full on their last all-one and Arsenal are three points clear at the top of the table. Time for 6-0-6.
