[0.00 - 3.40] P:1891.45 E:0.033338 |  Lewis and Gundawan, De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva,
[3.40 - 7.08] P:1715.35 E:0.092143 |  Docku and Grealish coming into the side with top scorer,
[7.08 - 12.64] P:1624.96 E:0.098190 |  18-goal Harland up front and Phil Forden and Matteo Kovacic
[12.64 - 13.92] P:1586.37 E:0.089014 |  on the bench.
[13.92 - 16.56] P:1608.88 E:0.102323 |  I think there's more of an eye on them for Sunday
[16.56 - 19.96] P:1659.84 E:0.094339 |  because for Manchester City it is two matches this week
[19.96 - 22.28] P:1724.09 E:0.090083 |  against two of the great clubs of Europe.
[22.28 - 24.60] P:1736.83 E:0.077916 |  Juventus tonight, here in Turin,
[24.60 - 26.96] P:1781.15 E:0.084204 |  and on Sunday the Manchester Derby.
[27.04 - 30.92] P:1871.60 E:0.100931 |  I hope you'll be with us for both of those matches on five live
[30.92 - 32.32] P:1920.95 E:0.100908 |  as the whistle goes.
[32.32 - 35.36] P:2010.60 E:0.107772 |  Listeners to Radio Manchester are with us as well.
[35.36 - 37.76] P:1895.44 E:0.084967 |  You can listen on the move on BBC Sounds,
[37.76 - 41.12] P:1784.85 E:0.091951 |  and it is Juventus in the black and white striped shirts,
[41.12 - 42.64] P:1793.61 E:0.081889 |  white shorts, white socks,
[42.64 - 45.20] P:1710.88 E:0.091084 |  who clear the ball out for a throw into Manchester City,
[45.20 - 48.68] P:1662.51 E:0.091321 |  who as we look from high up here on the dressing room side of the ground,
[48.68 - 50.32] P:1671.25 E:0.086280 |  are playing from right to left
[50.32 - 55.24] P:1810.11 E:0.100964 |  and will obviously keep you right across the Arsenal-Monaco match tonight as well,
[55.32 - 59.28] P:1687.34 E:0.087736 |  which is currently 12th against 13th in the table.
[59.28 - 63.40] P:1719.30 E:0.082410 |  So Arsenal also with work to do, like these two clubs,
[63.40 - 65.40] P:1604.47 E:0.110962 |  if they're going to finish in the top eight,
[65.40 - 67.60] P:1805.00 E:0.086878 |  and that means if you finish in the top eight,
[67.60 - 71.24] P:1659.67 E:0.094047 |  you will qualify automatically for the round of 16.
[71.24 - 74.72] P:1746.35 E:0.095842 |  As Manchester City have possession on the edge of their own penalty area,
[74.72 - 78.36] P:1690.83 E:0.097338 |  and Gavadiole turns it back to goalkeeper Ederson,
[78.36 - 80.80] P:1924.14 E:0.095717 |  who's back in after Ortega started the last three,
[80.80 - 84.28] P:1547.89 E:0.088462 |  but Pep Guardiola switching it around with the goalkeepers.
[84.32 - 87.24] P:1515.03 E:0.083318 |  Yeah, but they're good goalkeepers, and he accepts it,
[87.24 - 89.04] P:1501.34 E:0.098002 |  when we get a chance now and again,
[89.04 - 92.12] P:1604.94 E:0.100855 |  and he would be worried about that if you're a defender,
[92.12 - 94.68] P:1637.85 E:0.087375 |  actually, if you're a Manchester City fan, he's getting off.
[94.68 - 98.04] P:1727.83 E:0.097119 |  Here's Kevin De Bruyne on the right-hand side just presently.
[98.04 - 101.80] P:1613.85 E:0.100814 |  Bernardo Silva's there as well, it goes back to Kyle Walker, then Gundawan.
[101.80 - 105.60] P:1550.24 E:0.102586 |  And it is Gundawan and Lewis who are in the midfield roles,
[105.60 - 108.08] P:1535.84 E:0.082045 |  with Lewis dropping back into the back line,
[108.08 - 109.60] P:1739.93 E:0.087409 |  when Juventus have possession,
[109.60 - 113.88] P:1516.57 E:0.086304 |  but Kevin De Bruyne again on the right-hand side goes back into his own half.
[113.88 - 117.12] P:1692.46 E:0.108234 |  Douglas Louise is on the bench for Juventus tonight,
[117.12 - 120.16] P:1673.74 E:0.099660 |  as is Weston McKenney as well, the USA International,
[120.16 - 123.00] P:1600.82 E:0.096915 |  that you might remember being on loan at Leeds United,
[123.00 - 126.40] P:1632.19 E:0.095284 |  they're two of the Juventus players who are coming back from injury.
[126.40 - 131.28] P:1609.42 E:0.098008 |  But Nill, they're very early stages here, it's dry, it's very cold as well,
[131.28 - 133.92] P:1477.97 E:0.093894 |  and there is that alpine freshness in the air.
[133.92 - 138.04] P:1651.63 E:0.094824 |  With Manchester City doing exactly what Pep Guardiola asked them to do last night,
[138.04 - 141.52] P:1664.85 E:0.096548 |  when he was speaking to us, they are keeping it very simple, Pat.
[141.52 - 144.96] P:1577.58 E:0.099852 |  Yeah, they are. Not taking any chances with the passes just now,
[144.96 - 147.92] P:1487.52 E:0.098390 |  Bernardo Silva is the first player to try and take anyone on.
[147.92 - 150.44] P:1657.29 E:0.097408 |  But you're right, the pivotal player is Rico Lewis.
[150.44 - 153.12] P:1503.04 E:0.082087 |  He started with the possession at the left-back,
[153.12 - 156.28] P:1498.28 E:0.084430 |  he's not actually been there since the first 10 seconds of the game,
[156.28 - 158.72] P:1396.50 E:0.084596 |  they've moved into that centre-midfield position,
[158.72 - 161.60] P:1541.96 E:0.090968 |  and that is how he does that in that position,
[161.60 - 164.12] P:1477.64 E:0.080616 |  because it's so important to Manchester City,
[164.12 - 166.56] P:1669.06 E:0.081122 |  because that player controls how much you hold the ball.
[166.56 - 169.48] P:1803.52 E:0.099022 |  Rico Lewis will be suspended after being sent off at Salos Park,
[169.60 - 172.16] P:1545.45 E:0.103784 |  De Bruyne and now with a cross, deep from the right-hand side,
[172.16 - 175.44] P:1693.77 E:0.105854 |  but goalkeeper Di Gregorio can come and catch that high up above Harland.
[175.44 - 177.36] P:1633.54 E:0.101809 |  And the other thing as well is, Pat, you know,
[177.36 - 180.16] P:1739.92 E:0.104816 |  has sort of blithely mentioned that Grealish would be on one side
[180.16 - 186.40] P:1548.98 E:0.100778 |  and Docu on the other, but Grealish, I mean, it's not really a number 10 role, is it?
[186.40 - 189.12] P:1524.71 E:0.095613 |  It's a left-sided midfield role.
[189.12 - 192.44] P:1515.79 E:0.101463 |  Yeah, but at Bellum's, the double 10, De Bruyne will be one side,
[192.44 - 196.00] P:1568.30 E:0.096932 |  I think that Grealish will be the other side of Harland,
[196.00 - 199.40] P:1704.75 E:0.095323 |  and there's kind of half-positions in the plate all over the place there.
[199.44 - 202.68] P:1695.79 E:0.095798 |  Which looks great, we're in a positive position in the home,
[202.68 - 206.40] P:1623.75 E:0.094348 |  but there are weaknesses to that, and I would say Closley Sal,
[206.40 - 209.88] P:1415.59 E:0.103208 |  who's on the right-hand side here, he's going to be a lot of space,
[209.88 - 212.76] P:1301.75 E:0.091519 |  if he can get the ball one-on-one against Guardio,
[212.76 - 215.36] P:1392.90 E:0.092176 |  that's something that he'll look forward to.
[215.36 - 217.72] P:1452.09 E:0.098587 |  That's Pat Nevin with us for the commentary,
[217.72 - 221.52] P:1664.74 E:0.093694 |  Scotland International twice Chelsea player of the year,
[221.52 - 224.72] P:1592.97 E:0.099931 |  and looking down at the winger here on the left-hand side for Manchester City,
[224.72 - 229.04] P:1547.57 E:0.093607 |  Docu, who is all on his own, way out wide on the left wing,
[229.24 - 231.48] P:1637.50 E:0.096941 |  I don't think he's had a touch of the ball yet,
[231.48 - 234.64] P:1424.84 E:0.092559 |  because it's all been on the right-hand side for Manchester City,
[234.64 - 237.20] P:1298.74 E:0.102776 |  and it's there again with Bernardo Silva,
[237.20 - 240.00] P:1291.44 E:0.079867 |  comes back to de Gundewan,
[240.00 - 242.76] P:1429.57 E:0.097043 |  Manchester City's Champions League-winning captain,
[242.76 - 245.60] P:1462.23 E:0.088697 |  to the now-club captain, Kyle Walker,
[245.60 - 248.36] P:1621.22 E:0.096055 |  then forward again to Rico Lewis, passes it back,
[248.36 - 250.48] P:1425.11 E:0.098431 |  Juventus just can't get a touch of the ball,
[250.48 - 253.12] P:1578.82 E:0.096813 |  Benfica are winning one-nil against Bologna,
[253.12 - 257.32] P:1527.71 E:0.097429 |  that is the first goal of the night in the eight-o-clock kick-offs,
[257.32 - 258.92] P:1431.51 E:0.101872 |  with Benfica one-nil up,
[258.92 - 261.72] P:1382.07 E:0.089783 |  Manchester City with the ball on the right-hand side,
[261.72 - 267.20] P:1444.43 E:0.094022 |  with Bernardo Silva bears a touch to knock it out of play from Kenan Yildiz,
[267.20 - 269.08] P:1439.80 E:0.095497 |  and it's a throw-in to Manchester City.
[269.08 - 271.84] P:1660.62 E:0.096096 |  Kipping you across all of the matches in the championship tonight,
[271.84 - 275.52] P:1526.68 E:0.092973 |  still winning for the first goal of the evening,
[275.52 - 278.52] P:1557.82 E:0.093324 |  and the choice of listening tonight, the sports extra,
[278.52 - 282.36] P:1566.65 E:0.102814 |  option is the T20, and that goes beyond the Benfica,
[282.36 - 285.28] P:1337.33 E:0.104999 |  goes beyond, so it's back to nil-nil between those two.
[285.28 - 291.24] P:1255.17 E:0.092919 |  So nil-nil, here in Turin, completely enclosed stadium,
[291.24 - 296.08] P:1404.02 E:0.100649 |  the stadium that was built to replace the old Stadio della Alpi,
[296.08 - 298.72] P:1642.14 E:0.102474 |  you must have come here, Pat, to the old della Alpi,
[298.72 - 300.52] P:1646.21 E:0.091686 |  with that big track around,
[300.52 - 303.44] P:1677.29 E:0.099213 |  it felt as though you were miles and miles away from the action.
[303.44 - 305.44] P:1750.54 E:0.110020 |  This new stadium brilliantly rebuilt
[305.44 - 307.72] P:1509.88 E:0.093006 |  with all of the white metalwork above our heads,
[307.72 - 310.16] P:1599.74 E:0.104391 |  everyone has got a great view and is close to the action,
[310.16 - 312.32] P:1634.54 E:0.093927 |  as it comes up to Docky on the halfway line,
[312.32 - 314.44] P:1672.29 E:0.092938 |  Docky was being took back there by Gatti,
[314.44 - 316.44] P:1538.93 E:0.095586 |  and it's a free kick on the halfway line,
[316.44 - 318.44] P:1472.78 E:0.086758 |  given by Clement Terpan, the French referee.
[318.44 - 321.56] P:1615.04 E:0.091465 |  Yeah, the atmosphere has not changed a great deal,
[321.56 - 323.56] P:1540.47 E:0.087920 |  no matter what the stadium looks like.
[323.56 - 326.36] P:1738.56 E:0.094049 |  The fans have been fantastic all the way from the start of this game,
[326.36 - 328.60] P:1733.75 E:0.099892 |  and considering the difficult run they've been having,
[328.60 - 330.60] P:1663.96 E:0.091519 |  they're absolutely up for these fans.
[330.60 - 332.60] P:1761.41 E:0.099922 |  But the thing is, the team kind of got kicked,
[332.60 - 335.96] P:1719.47 E:0.087277 |  the ball just now, and Manseter tried to close them down high up the field,
[335.96 - 338.36] P:1776.16 E:0.092894 |  this is important to see if they're capable of doing it.
[338.36 - 340.76] P:1795.94 E:0.107759 |  That was brave from D. Gregorio, the goalkeeper,
[340.76 - 343.60] P:1645.09 E:0.086304 |  passing it between De Bruyne and Grealish.
[343.60 - 346.72] P:1726.57 E:0.084144 |  He had to get that absolutely right to Locatelli, but he did.
[346.72 - 351.60] P:1806.78 E:0.099573 |  And now finally, the Bianconeri have got possession of the ball,
[351.60 - 353.60] P:1787.66 E:0.106147 |  and you can hear the reaction from the crowd,
[353.60 - 356.60] P:1881.79 E:0.100542 |  as the ball is played through to Flavage, might have been offside.
[356.60 - 359.60] P:1881.50 E:0.092265 |  Still Flavage takes it out towards the left and shoots it,
[359.60 - 361.60] P:1829.68 E:0.104577 |  deflected behind it, then the offside flag goes up,
[361.60 - 364.60] P:1797.43 E:0.103616 |  and you can hear the reaction from the popular end to our right.
[364.60 - 367.60] P:1738.68 E:0.099985 |  Yeah, we had not been too clever, we were dead on line without it.
[367.60 - 369.60] P:1870.35 E:0.085098 |  You could see that it had gone offside,
[369.60 - 371.60] P:1719.37 E:0.088490 |  you're going far, I would say far too early,
[371.60 - 372.60] P:1401.57 E:0.091839 |  but a little bit too early.
[372.60 - 375.60] P:1656.67 E:0.093272 |  I mean, it is an intriguing way that it's been set up,
[375.60 - 378.60] P:1659.42 E:0.110298 |  Manseter said just now, and it's going to take a little while
[378.60 - 382.60] P:1950.47 E:0.105361 |  for Juventus to figure out what Stronan and where the spaces are.
[382.60 - 385.60] P:1727.03 E:0.102273 |  You can see they're used to that, they're comfortable with that,
[385.60 - 387.60] P:1487.83 E:0.096806 |  and Flavage and Yildiz hasn't got on the ball yet,
[387.60 - 389.60] P:1627.82 E:0.106625 |  these are very, very special players,
[389.60 - 392.60] P:1613.82 E:0.097392 |  and he'll be desperate for a chance to have a goalkeeper.
[392.60 - 394.60] P:1842.15 E:0.099031 |  So this is Champions League commentary last night,
[394.60 - 398.60] P:1711.81 E:0.105344 |  we brought your commentary from inside the stadiums in Spain and Germany.
[398.60 - 400.60] P:1723.85 E:0.111774 |  Tonight we're in Italy, tomorrow night Europa League,
[400.60 - 403.60] P:1602.60 E:0.091623 |  don't miss that, from Ibrox, we'll be inside the stadium,
[403.60 - 407.60] P:1668.12 E:0.096225 |  not sure you're getting that anywhere else, and it is nil-nil here.
[407.60 - 410.60] P:1657.45 E:0.100757 |  We're also keeping across the matches in the women's Champions League,
[410.60 - 413.60] P:1751.83 E:0.095303 |  where Chelsea have taken the lead against 20,
[413.60 - 417.60] P:1546.83 E:0.092491 |  Catarina Macario with the goal for Chelsea,
[417.60 - 421.60] P:1767.26 E:0.090498 |  Celtic playing Real Madrid in the women's Champions League tonight.
[421.60 - 426.60] P:1609.78 E:0.090616 |  De Bruyne, five yards inside the Juventus heart,
[426.60 - 429.60] P:1526.43 E:0.086505 |  very much hooking the far touch line,
[429.60 - 432.60] P:1677.40 E:0.089676 |  and then Walker gives it back to Kevin De Bruyne,
[432.60 - 435.60] P:1800.81 E:0.098918 |  and De Bruyne flips it forward towards Harland on the edge of the area,
[435.60 - 438.60] P:1590.74 E:0.095575 |  tried to give it back to De Bruyne, too many black and white shirts in there,
[438.60 - 440.60] P:1455.34 E:0.105784 |  and then it's run away by Yildiz,
[440.60 - 443.60] P:1544.09 E:0.096239 |  who's actually forced to run it all the way back into his own full-back position,
[443.60 - 447.60] P:1789.88 E:0.099512 |  where De Nilo passes it forward to Touram,
[447.60 - 452.60] P:1679.62 E:0.092702 |  another of the sons of the great Lillian Touram,
[452.60 - 455.60] P:1469.56 E:0.094389 |  the French international World Cup winner.
[455.60 - 458.60] P:1582.63 E:0.106553 |  De Bruyne now tries to, and I think he might have been pulled back there by Gatti,
[458.60 - 461.60] P:1728.70 E:0.102165 |  but referee who was right there said no, De Bruyne went to ground,
[461.60 - 463.60] P:1633.65 E:0.096345 |  there weren't too many complaints from De Bruyne,
[463.60 - 464.60] P:1625.88 E:0.104346 |  and he went back with it.
[464.60 - 466.60] P:1669.98 E:0.092443 |  He lost control of the ball, it was a pullback, but he'd lost control of the ball,
[466.60 - 468.60] P:1518.42 E:0.086482 |  and he wasn't going to get it there,
[468.60 - 470.60] P:1502.57 E:0.103227 |  with that heart showing on, but you know, a referee,
[470.60 - 472.60] P:1670.09 E:0.100733 |  that's how he understood how it was going to play.
[472.60 - 474.60] P:1724.65 E:0.108947 |  Really intriguing to see, UV,
[474.60 - 476.60] P:1577.48 E:0.097108 |  they think they can play through this city team,
[476.60 - 479.60] P:1549.90 E:0.093146 |  they think this high-press ain't going to work,
[479.60 - 482.60] P:1541.32 E:0.094070 |  they don't think Manchester City have the energy to keep it up,
[482.60 - 485.60] P:1428.81 E:0.093599 |  very intriguing to see that they're wanting to do that,
[485.60 - 489.60] P:1744.35 E:0.087715 |  and almost drawing Manchester City up the field to try.
[489.60 - 491.60] P:1575.18 E:0.104304 |  So it's still 0-0 here,
[491.60 - 494.60] P:1548.37 E:0.088629 |  and neither goalkeeper has had a save to make.
[494.60 - 498.60] P:1770.98 E:0.100481 |  By the way, five lives, Champions League Final Score is in operation tonight,
[498.60 - 502.60] P:1747.96 E:0.095372 |  so you can listen to our commentary alongside the Final Score graphics and the video printer.
[502.60 - 505.60] P:1548.57 E:0.095405 |  If you go to the red button on your television,
[505.60 - 511.60] P:1469.76 E:0.095218 |  the iPlayer as well, you can click on Champions League Final Score and do that.
[511.60 - 514.60] P:1771.29 E:0.100612 |  So, 0-0 here in the early stages, how have things started at Arsenal?
[515.60 - 519.60] P:1678.44 E:0.111248 |  Arsenal 0-0, Milooslaviskeli only recently turned 18,
[519.60 - 523.60] P:1739.39 E:0.106342 |  Younger's player to start a Champions League game for Arsenal in over 13 years.
[523.60 - 525.60] P:1678.62 E:0.116639 |  He's begun ostensibly at left back,
[525.60 - 528.60] P:1764.91 E:0.102921 |  but as fullbacks do these days, he's creeping into midfield.
[528.60 - 532.60] P:1788.40 E:0.102228 |  Gabriel Jesus is at the first big chance of the evening, it's Arsenal 0-0.
[532.60 - 536.60] P:1883.34 E:0.092964 |  Thank you, Conor, and it is Conor who will be at Ibrox tomorrow night
[536.60 - 540.60] P:1799.19 E:0.089460 |  with James McFadden for the Rangers Tottenham commentary.
[540.60 - 542.60] P:1762.98 E:0.085003 |  That's it, that's a massive match,
[542.60 - 545.60] P:1720.93 E:0.092404 |  and here you've entered on the attack pad and they've won a corner.
[545.60 - 547.60] P:1603.87 E:0.094366 |  Well, I was going to talk at the start of the tour,
[547.60 - 549.60] P:1531.25 E:0.100195 |  we didn't have enough time to lead the chat,
[549.60 - 552.60] P:1709.18 E:0.079381 |  but we talked about the big match-ups in this game,
[552.60 - 554.60] P:1824.11 E:0.093949 |  you know, big players playing against each other.
[554.60 - 556.60] P:1834.00 E:0.097468 |  There's a very small match-up down there,
[556.60 - 559.60] P:1702.70 E:0.091801 |  isn't it? Conce Sal is playing against Rico Luz,
[559.60 - 561.60] P:1590.81 E:0.089335 |  and that's the first time he's had a run-up,
[561.60 - 563.60] P:1410.66 E:0.095783 |  and Luz lost him there.
[563.60 - 566.60] P:1434.83 E:0.089766 |  He's going down and injured himself there, Conce Sal.
[566.60 - 569.60] P:1723.46 E:0.082825 |  Now, to be fair, Conce Sal goes down a lot.
[569.60 - 573.60] P:1426.96 E:0.094300 |  I mean, he seems to have an inner-ear problem every time you see him play.
[573.60 - 577.60] P:1557.93 E:0.092365 |  Actually, in this thing, I think he's injured himself, he's not been kicked.
[577.60 - 579.60] P:1754.22 E:0.081439 |  I think he has actually injured himself.
[579.60 - 581.60] P:1639.87 E:0.096576 |  Well, they are...
[581.60 - 583.60] P:1703.68 E:0.091752 |  Look at that, I can see that.
[583.60 - 586.60] P:1589.65 E:0.093021 |  The spray that he's being administered to is...
[586.60 - 588.60] P:1749.74 E:0.096392 |  Dry-ice!
[588.60 - 590.60] P:1645.03 E:0.082256 |  It's like disco time.
[590.60 - 592.60] P:1824.44 E:0.104921 |  Let's hope he's OK. I know exactly what you mean.
[592.60 - 596.60] P:1778.32 E:0.103028 |  I saw him play last season for Porto in the Champions League.
[596.60 - 598.60] P:1809.10 E:0.115755 |  He's been out of the pitch,
[598.60 - 600.60] P:1853.52 E:0.099439 |  and we'll see if he's able to come back on.
[600.60 - 602.60] P:1817.52 E:0.097557 |  In the Champions League,
[602.60 - 604.60] P:1668.93 E:0.102961 |  Fiannaud are winning 1-0 against Sparta Braga,
[604.60 - 607.60] P:1647.41 E:0.087779 |  it was Fiannaud who had that comeback against Manchester City
[607.60 - 610.60] P:1589.24 E:0.096179 |  in their last match from 3-0 down.
[610.60 - 613.60] P:1536.26 E:0.085276 |  And also, trumpet playing,
[613.60 - 615.60] P:1468.10 E:0.095240 |  it is 1-0 to Young Boys,
[615.60 - 617.60] P:1681.97 E:0.092747 |  they're winning 1-0 against Stuttgart,
[617.60 - 620.60] P:1653.01 E:0.089763 |  having yet to win a point in the Champions League.
[620.60 - 624.60] P:1697.93 E:0.087253 |  Here is the corner, which is taken deep, deep to the back post
[624.60 - 626.60] P:1677.85 E:0.100822 |  by Coupe Minas, headed away by Lewis.
[626.60 - 628.60] P:1619.68 E:0.096518 |  There was no-one there for Juventus,
[628.60 - 630.60] P:1595.84 E:0.098580 |  but Lewis is headed out of play
[630.60 - 632.60] P:1623.16 E:0.085504 |  and has conceded how to come back on.
[632.60 - 634.60] P:1627.25 E:0.084406 |  Yes, he has. He's back on the field,
[634.60 - 636.60] P:1630.18 E:0.098230 |  so he looks as though he's all right.
[636.60 - 638.60] P:1675.19 E:0.086304 |  That spray has done its worth, perhaps.
[638.60 - 640.60] P:1571.73 E:0.085612 |  Yeah. The corner kick,
[640.60 - 644.60] P:1565.64 E:0.091314 |  we're so used to the real artists of the corner kick,
[644.60 - 648.60] P:1510.69 E:0.092292 |  getting it right, the likes of Arsenal and Stuttgart.
[650.60 - 652.60] P:1691.70 E:0.116126 |  A viewer.
[652.60 - 654.60] P:1678.80 E:0.063279 |  Very good.
[654.60 - 657.60] P:1487.05 E:0.100315 |  And as Nill, Manchester City, Nill,
[657.60 - 659.60] P:1394.79 E:0.104997 |  and the balls out of play for a throw-in-two city
[659.60 - 662.60] P:1433.03 E:0.109064 |  on the far side with Kyle Walker.
[662.60 - 665.60] P:1625.49 E:0.109331 |  And the cry of Juve,
[665.60 - 668.60] P:1574.95 E:0.102677 |  Juve comes up from the stand to our right,
[668.60 - 671.60] P:1515.05 E:0.093860 |  where all manner of flags,
[671.60 - 675.60] P:1568.33 E:0.094055 |  of varying messages and crests
[675.60 - 677.60] P:1652.19 E:0.098689 |  and flags are being waved all the way up
[677.60 - 679.60] P:1532.93 E:0.085724 |  and down the middle of that stand.
[679.60 - 681.60] P:1817.92 E:0.111875 |  Throw-in for Manchester City,
[681.60 - 683.60] P:1873.15 E:0.094859 |  which is deflected out of play
[683.60 - 687.60] P:1718.61 E:0.081793 |  for a throw-in-two Juventus.
[687.60 - 691.60] P:1567.42 E:0.080039 |  So back Juventus go to the centre of defence
[691.60 - 695.60] P:1463.79 E:0.110332 |  and all the way back to goalkeeper D. Gregorio.
[695.60 - 698.60] P:1490.69 E:0.095643 |  An opening goal of the night in the championship
[698.60 - 701.60] P:1646.74 E:0.101566 |  at the Hawthorns in the 8 o'clock kick-off,
[701.60 - 702.60] P:1707.63 E:0.094688 |  Sanirudh Ravajala.
[702.60 - 705.60] P:1598.53 E:0.100282 |  12-gone West Bromwich Albion 1, Coventry City,
[705.60 - 707.60] P:1756.88 E:0.117607 |  Nill, Tom Fellow is driving into the box,
[707.60 - 709.60] P:1792.39 E:0.098334 |  his shot was, his work was cleared,
[709.60 - 711.60] P:1798.83 E:0.101076 |  only to Alex Moer on the edge of the area
[711.60 - 713.60] P:1940.93 E:0.095195 |  who's hammered it home.
[713.60 - 715.60] P:1780.03 E:0.091770 |  West Bromwich Albion 1, Coventry City, Nill.
[715.60 - 718.60] P:1800.41 E:0.083631 |  In the Champions League, Feyenoord now 2-0 up on Sparta Prague.
[718.60 - 720.60] P:1647.22 E:0.100842 |  Another of our featured matches in the championship.
[720.60 - 722.60] P:1591.42 E:0.094846 |  Is it the den, Aaron Paul?
[722.60 - 724.60] P:1463.70 E:0.087975 |  Nill Sheffield United.
[724.60 - 726.60] P:1635.90 E:0.105959 |  Now how Sheffield United are not ahead,
[726.60 - 727.60] P:1588.08 E:0.106592 |  I do not know.
[727.60 - 730.60] P:1722.13 E:0.106486 |  We saw an attempt from Gustavo Haimer
[730.60 - 732.60] P:1806.45 E:0.090229 |  cross the box, and then, John,
[732.60 - 734.60] P:1745.13 E:0.097828 |  we've seen four or five cross-cum shots
[734.60 - 737.60] P:1690.51 E:0.099320 |  all evade the goal line of Lucas Jensen,
[737.60 - 739.60] P:1653.92 E:0.101609 |  baffling stuff from Sheffield United.
[739.60 - 742.60] P:1455.24 E:0.100665 |  They've definitely been in control in these opening phases,
[742.60 - 744.60] P:1640.34 E:0.107581 |  but atmosphere conversational here at the den,
[744.60 - 748.60] P:1479.75 E:0.101022 |  very, very flat, following that news of Nill Harris's departure
[748.60 - 749.60] P:1580.18 E:0.089830 |  after the weekend's fixture.
[749.60 - 751.60] P:1689.90 E:0.105229 |  27-gone Millwell Nill, Sheffield United now.
[751.60 - 754.60] P:1485.48 E:0.090146 |  Yes, his last home match in charge.
[754.60 - 757.60] P:1771.43 E:0.097826 |  Manchester City with the ball just outside the Juventus box.
[757.60 - 760.60] P:1707.53 E:0.091681 |  Lewis found Jack Grealish on the edge of the area,
[760.60 - 763.60] P:1622.13 E:0.098258 |  just lost possession, but Sidney have got it back.
[763.60 - 768.60] P:1458.15 E:0.096622 |  Gavadial swings the pass to his left to Dockoo,
[768.60 - 772.60] P:1447.80 E:0.081560 |  and then Lewis and Gavadial again,
[772.60 - 774.60] P:1682.71 E:0.094703 |  as Grealish is after it,
[774.60 - 777.60] P:1526.78 E:0.085802 |  but it's going to be taken back down there by Gatti,
[777.60 - 779.60] P:1694.25 E:0.093695 |  who turns, finds the pass away.
[779.60 - 781.60] P:1655.75 E:0.100588 |  Lewis, though, is able to get up and head it forward.
[781.60 - 784.60] P:1545.40 E:0.098054 |  Dockoo is, I think, caught there.
[784.60 - 787.60] P:1743.00 E:0.104778 |  He was the defender, the young right-back Savona
[787.60 - 788.60] P:1799.59 E:0.096718 |  was looking at clearing away,
[788.60 - 791.60] P:1666.86 E:0.094446 |  and it was just touched away from him by Dockoo.
[791.60 - 794.60] P:1784.24 E:0.093025 |  He was already through with his kick and caught the Manchester City player
[794.60 - 795.60] P:1493.17 E:0.054818 |  for a free kick.
[795.60 - 798.60] P:1615.28 E:0.089516 |  Yeah, he stood in the back of his foot there.
[798.60 - 803.60] P:1591.37 E:0.090492 |  No shock news, Constance was always back down in his backside again.
[803.60 - 806.60] P:1557.69 E:0.096652 |  Honestly, the guy should have been a warram.
[806.60 - 807.60] P:1791.29 E:0.112693 |  He's always timing the ground.
[807.60 - 809.60] P:1713.41 E:0.086604 |  Anyway, so, you know, I've got a chance here.
[809.60 - 812.60] P:1646.52 E:0.103078 |  The player such as De Bruyne and Dockoo, Grealish,
[812.60 - 815.60] P:1795.65 E:0.093690 |  they haven't really got on the ball that much in the final third,
[815.60 - 817.60] P:1671.23 E:0.078447 |  but gaps will open up.
[817.60 - 819.60] P:1616.21 E:0.080682 |  It's just seeing if they can do something with it.
[819.60 - 822.60] P:1731.52 E:0.085618 |  Savona takes this free kick, actually takes it down the line
[822.60 - 824.60] P:1753.61 E:0.099057 |  to Dockoo, could have delivered it into the area.
[824.60 - 827.60] P:1540.11 E:0.097137 |  Here is the delivery to the near post, headed away by two-ram.
[827.60 - 830.60] P:1561.73 E:0.090267 |  Grealish with the volley square on the edge of the box,
[830.60 - 832.60] P:1231.27 E:0.096088 |  over there to the right, Bernardo Silva,
[832.60 - 835.60] P:1444.24 E:0.079075 |  and then it comes back to Gundawan,
[835.60 - 839.60] P:1598.52 E:0.100962 |  who is very much a part of this Manchester City team.
[839.60 - 843.60] P:1642.71 E:0.092746 |  This is his 14th start in the last 16 matches.
[843.60 - 845.60] P:1677.21 E:0.097542 |  I'm not sure that was necessarily the plan
[845.60 - 848.60] P:1537.62 E:0.101484 |  when he was brought back to Manchester City at the age of 34,
[848.60 - 850.60] P:1574.82 E:0.099273 |  but needs must be exactly.
[850.60 - 853.60] P:1469.95 E:0.091616 |  There were a number of players that he was seeing his back up for
[853.60 - 856.60] P:1435.15 E:0.086979 |  when he brought him back in, but he absolutely has to be in there.
[856.60 - 859.60] P:1539.99 E:0.091375 |  But as I say, Rico, though, is actually probably the more important one
[859.60 - 862.60] P:1659.00 E:0.085885 |  in that central area, just trying to play through him.
[862.60 - 864.60] P:1647.34 E:0.091443 |  And he's getting all out of the ball,
[864.60 - 867.60] P:1606.73 E:0.094315 |  but he's had maybe one forward pass in the game so far.
[867.60 - 869.60] P:1582.32 E:0.095651 |  Do you think that, Rodri, position is easy?
[869.60 - 871.60] P:1371.41 E:0.075640 |  It isn't.
[871.60 - 875.60] P:1400.78 E:0.096938 |  No, as they are very obviously demonstrating.
[875.60 - 879.60] P:1642.79 E:0.093889 |  Juventus nil, Manchester City nil, still Arsenal nil,
[879.60 - 884.60] P:1685.66 E:0.087909 |  Monaco nil, and the ball has found its way back to Edison,
[884.60 - 888.60] P:1677.35 E:0.103310 |  who in the absence of Allyson, with his injury,
[888.60 - 891.60] P:1904.64 E:0.106995 |  Edison has been the Brazilian first choice
[891.60 - 894.60] P:1878.06 E:0.094196 |  for the last four World Cup qualifiers.
[894.60 - 897.60] P:1448.42 E:0.092634 |  Back in goal tonight,
[897.60 - 900.60] P:1706.33 E:0.087972 |  with City playing the ball out from the back,
[900.60 - 903.60] P:1731.43 E:0.084941 |  and Gundawan under pressure, finding Diaz,
[903.60 - 906.60] P:1680.28 E:0.098659 |  and Walker in the end has to hit the long pass,
[906.60 - 909.60] P:1645.72 E:0.091854 |  which is deflected out for throwing to Manchester City.
[909.60 - 913.60] P:1388.28 E:0.096770 |  Manchester City, they're almost asking Manchester City
[913.60 - 915.60] P:1533.58 E:0.093540 |  to play it out from the back, saying,
[915.60 - 917.60] P:1596.90 E:0.079558 |  we actually think we can do you there.
[917.60 - 921.60] P:1539.96 E:0.093985 |  And they feel as if Manchester City had the really well before.
[921.60 - 923.60] P:1602.56 E:0.094301 |  They're giving them no time at all
[923.60 - 925.60] P:1715.90 E:0.088418 |  when they're close to going up the pitch there,
[925.60 - 927.60] P:1701.41 E:0.096196 |  and that's twice as nearly quite city.
[927.60 - 929.60] P:1604.27 E:0.064486 |  However, this time, City have got it.
[929.60 - 931.60] P:1713.39 E:0.093253 |  15 minutes played,
[931.60 - 934.60] P:1622.88 E:0.094816 |  and really not too much to right home about so far,
[934.60 - 936.60] P:1757.75 E:0.092139 |  as Dooku goes on a weaving run
[936.60 - 938.60] P:1720.45 E:0.073376 |  and was just sort of balked there
[938.60 - 941.60] P:1758.95 E:0.090699 |  as he took it past Coop Minor, so that's a free kick,
[941.60 - 944.60] P:1639.41 E:0.095966 |  middle of the half, over towards this left-hand side.
[944.60 - 947.60] P:1451.76 E:0.091231 |  It's a vibrant atmosphere, as it always is here.
[947.60 - 950.60] P:1534.75 E:0.094689 |  The Amanda supporters, whenever you come to Italy,
[950.60 - 953.60] P:1514.03 E:0.100376 |  they are so passionate, aren't they?
[953.60 - 956.60] P:1425.33 E:0.103110 |  I mean, when they opened the doors, what was it like?
[956.60 - 958.60] P:1695.11 E:0.082075 |  There was a sprint to get in.
[958.60 - 961.60] P:1499.08 E:0.094230 |  My guys, there's two hours and girls.
[961.60 - 963.60] P:1656.67 E:0.096840 |  Walking, running down the steps,
[963.60 - 967.60] P:1596.79 E:0.092594 |  getting their places with their tight black jackets on.
[967.60 - 969.60] P:1528.64 E:0.098021 |  They all seem to wear tight black jackets, don't they?
[969.60 - 972.60] P:1460.15 E:0.096720 |  Or the majority? Free kick then for De Bruyne.
[972.60 - 974.60] P:1678.55 E:0.085307 |  De Bruyne, Harlan just takes up a position
[974.60 - 977.60] P:1488.10 E:0.093210 |  outside the six-yard box, makes himself very obvious.
[977.60 - 981.60] P:1400.25 E:0.093614 |  De Bruyne plays it in, it's headed up and away by Turam,
[981.60 - 983.60] P:1450.12 E:0.092118 |  then further away by Consisau,
[983.60 - 986.60] P:1387.79 E:0.096689 |  but only giving possession back to the marooned shirts
[986.60 - 990.60] P:1396.56 E:0.093901 |  of Manchester City and Kyle Walker in the centre circle.
[990.60 - 992.60] P:1555.68 E:0.097796 |  If you're going to watch the highlights tonight
[992.60 - 996.60] P:1379.20 E:0.090768 |  on Champions League Match of the Day, which is on after the news,
[996.60 - 999.60] P:1648.85 E:0.098260 |  you won't see much of the first 15 minutes of this match.
[999.60 - 1002.60] P:1503.88 E:0.099139 |  No, they've just been testing each other out,
[1002.60 - 1006.60] P:1523.12 E:0.090440 |  seeing where everyone's playing, where's my man, who do I mark.
[1006.60 - 1009.60] P:1384.81 E:0.100714 |  When we've got the ball, where's the space going to be?
[1009.60 - 1011.60] P:1536.04 E:0.082883 |  But as the classic came of chess,
[1011.60 - 1014.60] P:1516.03 E:0.098882 |  as they try to figure each other's weaknesses out and so forth.
[1014.60 - 1018.60] P:1486.74 E:0.092890 |  That chess was very apt since we're watching the black and white
[1018.60 - 1023.60] P:1397.67 E:0.086402 |  of Juventus and Manchester City get the ball down on the halfway line.
[1023.60 - 1027.60] P:1312.99 E:0.091306 |  So remember, both of these sides, they have got eight points in the group
[1027.60 - 1032.60] P:1457.75 E:0.093626 |  coming into these matches in what UEFA call Match Day 6.
[1032.60 - 1035.60] P:1404.11 E:0.104540 |  So if there's a loser tonight, I mean, you're quite convinced
[1035.60 - 1038.60] P:1485.72 E:0.095056 |  that whoever loses, that's excellent play by Bernardo Silva
[1038.60 - 1040.60] P:1589.84 E:0.103490 |  on the edge of the area into the box,
[1040.60 - 1043.60] P:1618.92 E:0.096182 |  but his attempted cross was blocked by Danilo,
[1043.60 - 1046.60] P:1331.42 E:0.093485 |  who almost went down onto one knee, the long barrier to put it behind
[1046.60 - 1049.60] P:1493.29 E:0.083498 |  for a corner there first to Manchester City.
[1049.60 - 1056.60] P:1714.76 E:0.086898 |  Yeah, I think the loser tonight is so little chance of getting to the direct qualification.
[1056.60 - 1059.60] P:1476.04 E:0.103405 |  And I actually think either team, you know, if even if they draw,
[1059.60 - 1061.60] P:1698.47 E:0.101733 |  I think it's a real struggle for them.
[1061.60 - 1064.60] P:1493.60 E:0.091796 |  I think on the top of their minds is one thing that Peguardio said,
[1064.60 - 1069.60] P:1546.71 E:0.088194 |  one at a time, is actually getting through to the next round, even if it's qualifying.
[1069.60 - 1072.60] P:1620.81 E:0.082768 |  Yeah, so it's a corner then to Manchester City.
[1072.60 - 1076.60] P:1658.86 E:0.096542 |  Harland is being manhandled in it comes looking for Harland,
[1076.60 - 1078.60] P:1649.37 E:0.077770 |  he was stretching for it.
[1078.60 - 1082.60] P:1505.03 E:0.082784 |  I think the defender still had his arms around Harland,
[1082.60 - 1085.60] P:1485.77 E:0.093094 |  but wasn't able to get a clear head to it.
[1085.60 - 1088.60] P:1345.15 E:0.085117 |  Juventus played back from Locatelli,
[1088.60 - 1092.60] P:1580.96 E:0.095204 |  and then long from goalkeeper Di Gregorio,
[1092.60 - 1096.60] P:1638.80 E:0.091407 |  but Kyle Walker inside his own heart was able to turn it back to the City goalkeeper.
[1096.60 - 1099.60] P:1630.29 E:0.101997 |  I thought it's not been hugely exciting.
[1099.60 - 1102.60] P:1520.19 E:0.086834 |  You look at the technical side of the game just now,
[1102.60 - 1104.60] P:1686.62 E:0.088671 |  no players have got any space,
[1104.60 - 1107.60] P:1550.40 E:0.083131 |  and very rarely does a forward player get a one-on-one,
[1107.60 - 1113.60] P:1510.61 E:0.098783 |  an individual one-on-one in the last third against any of the defenders on both sides.
[1113.60 - 1115.60] P:1512.16 E:0.100796 |  It tells you most managers know what they're doing,
[1115.60 - 1117.60] P:1739.45 E:0.107485 |  most coaches know exactly what they're doing,
[1117.60 - 1119.60] P:1639.29 E:0.079789 |  but it's all about concentration,
[1119.60 - 1122.60] P:1516.64 E:0.086331 |  because eventually at some point a gap will open up,
[1122.60 - 1125.60] P:1650.50 E:0.090164 |  and it's to see who's capable of making good use of that gap.
[1125.60 - 1128.60] P:1534.03 E:0.083392 |  Manchester City with the ball in Juventus territory.
[1128.60 - 1130.60] P:1758.74 E:0.087094 |  Walker goes for a high,
[1130.60 - 1133.60] P:1656.19 E:0.088661 |  Crossfield pass, but Savona is underneath that,
[1133.60 - 1136.60] P:1405.92 E:0.085622 |  and is able to then get it back from Conce São,
[1136.60 - 1139.60] P:1428.74 E:0.089084 |  and then infield to Locatelli,
[1139.60 - 1142.60] P:1481.65 E:0.087944 |  and Juventus played across their back line,
[1142.60 - 1145.60] P:1362.03 E:0.092674 |  and over there towards the left-hand side,
[1145.60 - 1148.60] P:1629.67 E:0.092178 |  where Danilo will play it back into the six-yard box,
[1148.60 - 1151.60] P:1848.82 E:0.115515 |  as he is at the best of terrible press, as awful.
[1151.60 - 1153.60] P:1817.72 E:0.105346 |  Harland running right across him,
[1153.60 - 1156.60] P:1829.21 E:0.101265 |  and therefore De Gregorio is able to find the pass through Savona,
[1156.60 - 1160.60] P:1674.06 E:0.093441 |  and Savona now attacking the penalty area using Conce São to the right.
[1160.60 - 1162.60] P:1775.61 E:0.097724 |  City have got two men on him, Lewis and Docky.
[1162.60 - 1165.60] P:1671.47 E:0.089055 |  Back it goes from Conce São to Locatelli.
[1165.60 - 1168.60] P:1626.04 E:0.102141 |  Locatelli's aerial ball into the area is headed away by Cavadio,
[1168.60 - 1171.60] P:1581.58 E:0.091697 |  but it comes out to Juventus again,
[1171.60 - 1176.60] P:1785.64 E:0.109544 |  and this is a danger as the shot flashes across the face of goal from Yildiz,
[1176.60 - 1179.60] P:1849.38 E:0.108110 |  and given the angle that was probably the best part of 25 yards.
[1179.60 - 1182.60] P:1825.33 E:0.090655 |  Edison leaping to his left, but it bounced wide.
[1182.60 - 1185.60] P:1880.65 E:0.095263 |  Doing that's the first real chance we've had to see Yildiz.
[1185.60 - 1188.60] P:1785.36 E:0.086523 |  Just moments ago, I'm seeing there's very few times
[1188.60 - 1191.60] P:1686.00 E:0.093156 |  any player's got the chance of a one-on-one in the final third.
[1191.60 - 1193.60] P:1615.80 E:0.094907 |  Well, they've a little bit of a chance here,
[1193.60 - 1195.60] P:1657.94 E:0.087217 |  just a tiny little bit of an opening.
[1195.60 - 1197.60] P:1707.88 E:0.089629 |  Giver may be hard to cover,
[1197.60 - 1200.60] P:1716.28 E:0.095451 |  but you know it looked as if it's just about on target,
[1200.60 - 1204.60] P:1697.93 E:0.082404 |  but it's just swung away inches at the last moment.
[1204.60 - 1207.60] P:1744.25 E:0.085641 |  And the decision-winner's a lot of half a chance, actually, Stans.
[1207.60 - 1211.60] P:1649.24 E:0.093719 |  But something happened down the right-hand side there, Savona and Conce São.
[1211.60 - 1216.60] P:1792.27 E:0.081692 |  Conce São did the underlap there, had the bat of space, and then stopped.
[1216.60 - 1218.60] P:1789.95 E:0.085350 |  Do yourself a favour, Savona, keep on moving.
[1218.60 - 1220.60] P:1758.97 E:0.104017 |  It was an absolute disgrace to him.
[1220.60 - 1223.60] P:1744.95 E:0.087732 |  Unprofessional piece of play by Savona.
[1223.60 - 1225.60] P:1613.66 E:0.086170 |  You've got to work with Dwellas in front of you,
[1225.60 - 1228.60] P:1499.72 E:0.085834 |  not turn round to the crowd and say you've done something wrong.
[1228.60 - 1231.60] P:1537.96 E:0.095603 |  Savona still relatively inexperienced.
[1231.60 - 1237.60] P:1645.77 E:0.097758 |  He is 21, but this is his first season in the first team on stages like this.
[1237.60 - 1240.60] P:1720.87 E:0.085531 |  Juventus nil, Manchester City nil.
[1240.60 - 1243.60] P:1738.31 E:0.102275 |  Still Arsenal nil, Monaco nil.
[1243.60 - 1246.60] P:1662.05 E:0.078066 |  We'll be making regular visits there.
[1246.60 - 1251.60] P:1748.25 E:0.096246 |  Manchester City, there is a little bit of tension in the Alpine air here.
[1251.60 - 1254.60] P:1842.45 E:0.097778 |  Manchester City, who in the groups in recent seasons,
[1254.60 - 1256.60] P:1723.61 E:0.088839 |  has been relatively plain sailing.
[1256.60 - 1258.60] P:1607.72 E:0.079472 |  And I think that is one of the beauties.
[1258.60 - 1260.60] P:1495.77 E:0.100077 |  I think regular listeners will know
[1260.60 - 1265.60] P:1674.34 E:0.093047 |  I'm not completely sold on this new extended league phase of the Champions League,
[1265.60 - 1269.60] P:1761.40 E:0.092494 |  but Manchester City last season won all six group matches
[1269.60 - 1271.60] P:1752.65 E:0.099059 |  in the second season in a row,
[1271.60 - 1273.60] P:1655.78 E:0.090668 |  they finished top of that group.
[1273.60 - 1275.60] P:1692.08 E:0.085898 |  This is a very different challenge.
[1275.60 - 1278.60] P:1551.06 E:0.101674 |  Champions League is a very different Manchester City as well.
[1278.60 - 1280.60] P:1763.90 E:0.103386 |  That would be true also.
[1280.60 - 1282.60] P:1723.33 E:0.096379 |  But come back to a moment ago,
[1282.60 - 1284.60] P:1771.36 E:0.102760 |  there was a half chance there, it wasn't a foul U of A.
[1284.60 - 1287.60] P:1793.43 E:0.085960 |  It's because of that press that Manchester City tried to put on.
[1287.60 - 1290.60] P:1758.43 E:0.092880 |  And I was saying, U of A don't believe they're good enough to do it.
[1290.60 - 1293.60] P:1586.69 E:0.094907 |  And it was played through them much, much too easy.
[1293.60 - 1297.60] P:1494.99 E:0.098681 |  And left five Manchester City players completely in atelier for dead.
[1297.60 - 1301.60] P:1454.41 E:0.092596 |  So, the treaty is here, Manchester City, try that high press again.
[1301.60 - 1304.60] P:1652.10 E:0.094845 |  Nice ball forward from Gundawan to De Bruyne.
[1304.60 - 1310.60] P:1689.64 E:0.089738 |  And then Harlan cancels with Danilo on the half-way line, a flick in field.
[1310.60 - 1314.60] P:1681.18 E:0.098050 |  But that was read by Gundawan, who was left on his backside on the ground.
[1314.60 - 1318.60] P:1665.47 E:0.094827 |  Ball finds its way to Conce Sáu here, on the right flank for Juventus.
[1318.60 - 1320.60] P:1722.26 E:0.098450 |  Conce Sáu, Grealish and Lewis with him.
[1320.60 - 1323.60] P:1770.29 E:0.099148 |  He's found the ball across in between the two Manchester City men,
[1323.60 - 1327.60] P:1746.71 E:0.103048 |  but Bernardo Silva was back there to whip it away with his left foot.
[1327.60 - 1330.60] P:1790.36 E:0.102188 |  They're having a few good moments now, they're two wingers for Juventus.
[1330.60 - 1334.60] P:1698.89 E:0.084470 |  He certainly felt that before the game, if you can stop those two players playing,
[1334.60 - 1337.60] P:1601.79 E:0.093764 |  it stops a lot of the things that Juventus are capable of doing.
[1337.60 - 1339.60] P:1597.13 E:0.092425 |  By the way, they're playing just now, but that's offside.
[1339.60 - 1343.60] P:1639.01 E:0.103063 |  Offside against Coop Miners, who swung the ball all back from the left-hand side,
[1343.60 - 1347.60] P:1696.71 E:0.086063 |  but it was offside. Free kick taken quickly by Manchester City.
[1347.60 - 1350.60] P:1846.71 E:0.101850 |  Grealish is off and running, hair flowing as he does so.
[1350.60 - 1353.60] P:1688.16 E:0.090926 |  He's halfway inside the Juventus half, then gives it to his left, to De Bruyne.
[1353.60 - 1357.60] P:1657.60 E:0.097253 |  Now here is Jeremy Docku against the young man, the young right back, Savona.
[1357.60 - 1361.60] P:1502.69 E:0.091228 |  Chakes him on, but then Conce Sáu is handed off by Docku.
[1361.60 - 1368.60] P:1432.27 E:0.095757 |  And then as the ball is passed away, there's a little arm out from Conce Sáu to Docku.
[1368.60 - 1373.60] P:1712.54 E:0.095748 |  Nothing a force, but I don't think Conce Sáu is impressed by that.
[1373.60 - 1378.60] P:1696.35 E:0.091320 |  Manchester City have it with Gundawan and then Grealish back to Gundawan again,
[1378.60 - 1384.60] P:1604.31 E:0.100271 |  who just rolls the ball to his right to Ruben Diaz, who was extremely talkative last night.
[1384.60 - 1386.60] P:1460.30 E:0.095936 |  Wasn't he Ruben Diaz?
[1386.60 - 1389.60] P:1546.60 E:0.094773 |  Really nice to hear somebody talking.
[1389.60 - 1392.60] P:1506.60 E:0.106113 |  Here's De Bruyne now on the edge of the area, back to Bernardo Silva.
[1392.60 - 1395.60] P:1711.43 E:0.097093 |  Up comes the cross to the back post, it's bounced all the way to Docku.
[1395.60 - 1397.60] P:1570.98 E:0.091330 |  He gets it down, the area packed with defenders.
[1397.60 - 1403.60] P:1727.73 E:0.096627 |  Docku's ball across is cleared away on the edge of the six-yard box by Gatti.
[1403.60 - 1406.60] P:1630.56 E:0.100212 |  And it's actually kept in by Conce Sáu, to keep it in.
[1406.60 - 1407.60] P:1703.18 E:0.114382 |  Good for Docku.
[1407.60 - 1410.60] P:1489.94 E:0.099761 |  Yeah, but I was going to say that a moment ago there,
[1410.60 - 1414.60] P:1753.04 E:0.098431 |  that Docku had a chance to run his defender before that and didn't do it.
[1414.60 - 1418.60] P:1779.37 E:0.103400 |  Well, a few seconds left, he did do it and it got to the ball in very easily.
[1418.60 - 1425.60] P:1687.50 E:0.106093 |  Here's Kup Minas, the former Atalanta man who left the club after winning the Europa League last season.
[1425.60 - 1429.60] P:1522.35 E:0.096799 |  But he was unable to find the pass that he needed to Vlahavic.
[1429.60 - 1433.60] P:1470.89 E:0.105630 |  And now Manchester City have it on the left-hand side with Docku, takes on Savonar again
[1433.60 - 1438.60] P:1636.83 E:0.100860 |  and then plays it through delightfully to De Bruyne, whose ball couldn't find Harland, cleared away.
[1438.60 - 1442.60] P:1671.22 E:0.107198 |  And then as Bernardo Silva comes in, the defender just got to it first
[1442.60 - 1444.60] P:1711.25 E:0.094840 |  and Juventus are able to bring it away.
[1444.60 - 1454.60] P:1651.81 E:0.088264 |  I can tell you that England won by six wickets against South Africa to take the series against South Africa 2-1.
[1454.60 - 1457.60] P:1644.24 E:0.100624 |  So they'll be wrapping things up right now on Sports Extra.
[1457.60 - 1459.60] P:1488.31 E:0.108813 |  But it is Juventus, Nail, Manchester City, Nail.
[1459.60 - 1463.60] P:1403.85 E:0.101176 |  And let's get another update from Conor McNamara back in London.
[1463.60 - 1468.60] P:1645.68 E:0.111069 |  Arsenal, Nail, Monaco, Nail, first scare for Arsenal, Kivio lost it cheaply on the edge of his own area.
[1468.60 - 1472.60] P:1642.23 E:0.102930 |  Alexander Gullivan pounced, lashing a shot that was only marginally up-target.
[1472.60 - 1475.60] P:1683.73 E:0.096551 |  Down the other end, Odegard has come close for Arsenal.
[1475.60 - 1477.60] P:1750.93 E:0.105931 |  We are 23, almost 24 minutes in.
[1477.60 - 1479.60] P:1639.28 E:0.102876 |  Arsenal have not had a corner yet.
[1479.60 - 1482.60] P:1767.42 E:0.099096 |  They're appealing for one now, but they're not going to get it.
[1482.60 - 1484.60] P:1713.59 E:0.102443 |  Monaco have done their homework.
[1484.60 - 1486.60] P:1743.09 E:0.099345 |  They're not going to give our tennis team that opportunity.
[1486.60 - 1488.60] P:1693.21 E:0.101975 |  Arsenal, Nail, Monaco, Nail.
[1488.60 - 1490.60] P:1879.52 E:0.047833 |  Thank you, Conor.
[1490.60 - 1498.60] P:1677.33 E:0.084635 |  Arsenal are currently down in 12th place and Monaco in 13th in the live table.
[1498.60 - 1503.60] P:1587.55 E:0.102122 |  If you're going to a match on the final night of the Champions League,
[1503.60 - 1508.60] P:1540.22 E:0.099932 |  you're going to need to make sure you've got very good connectivity so you know what's going on.
[1508.60 - 1513.60] P:1524.69 E:0.101511 |  It might be worth listening to us as long as we've got good connectivity on the last night of the Champions League.
[1513.60 - 1518.60] P:1364.97 E:0.095704 |  Very intriguing. We're talking about 15 minutes, not a great deal of harming.
[1518.60 - 1521.60] P:1412.30 E:0.088198 |  Then it just suddenly broke out there, didn't it?
[1521.60 - 1524.60] P:1520.07 E:0.091206 |  We've had seven or eight minutes, it's been much, much more often.
[1524.60 - 1527.60] P:1389.61 E:0.080890 |  Players have been getting into space there.
[1527.60 - 1529.60] P:1323.71 E:0.086249 |  The Browns have found a lot of pockets.
[1529.60 - 1533.60] P:1516.89 E:0.082315 |  He's been looking for 15 minutes to see where those pockets of space are.
[1533.60 - 1537.60] P:1502.78 E:0.096085 |  Now Doc is getting involved a little bit and the game has stretched a little bit more than it had before.
[1537.60 - 1540.60] P:1456.73 E:0.086652 |  Gavardi all approaches the halfway line.
[1540.60 - 1544.60] P:1574.81 E:0.083182 |  Gavardi Grilish has dropped all the way back there as well.
[1544.60 - 1550.60] P:1738.98 E:0.096991 |  And then in the centre circle, Ruben Bias rolls it out to the right-hand side.
[1550.60 - 1554.60] P:1872.88 E:0.103728 |  Bernardo Silva is there, comes back to Kyle Walker.
[1554.60 - 1559.60] P:1701.69 E:0.103009 |  Walker uses Rico Lewis as a little look over his shoulder, all of that black hair of his.
[1559.60 - 1561.60] P:1373.88 E:0.106750 |  Bobbing, Rico Lewis.
[1561.60 - 1566.60] P:1460.44 E:0.100535 |  Now past his teenage years, he's 20 now, the England international.
[1566.60 - 1572.60] P:1582.85 E:0.092783 |  Docu on the left goes to the byline, but I think he overran it before he got the cross and he did.
[1572.60 - 1575.60] P:1474.33 E:0.098168 |  And it was a goal kick to Juventus.
[1575.60 - 1579.60] P:1375.68 E:0.094913 |  We have not yet had an attempt on goal from Manchester City.
[1579.60 - 1582.60] P:1537.24 E:0.100534 |  Just that one attempt at the other end, the shot from Yildiz,
[1582.60 - 1585.60] P:1481.35 E:0.095500 |  which bounced wide at the Manchester City goal.
[1585.60 - 1589.60] P:1639.18 E:0.089919 |  A couple of teams have tried to put crosses in there, but not a huge amount.
[1589.60 - 1593.60] P:1619.54 E:0.090087 |  And once again, we were trying to draw them in a little bit,
[1593.60 - 1595.60] P:1633.38 E:0.086387 |  but Manchester City have got it again.
[1595.60 - 1597.60] P:1847.35 E:0.105350 |  In the championship, goal at Millwall, Aaron Paul.
[1597.60 - 1600.60] P:1759.91 E:0.114611 |  Four minutes to the break, Millwall-Nill, Sheffield United won it,
[1600.60 - 1605.60] P:1837.09 E:0.106116 |  and after a hat-trick of Millwall chances, Sheffield United break the deadlock.
[1605.60 - 1608.60] P:1812.49 E:0.102533 |  Gustavo Harmer played in off the right, gorgeous ball through,
[1608.60 - 1611.60] P:1894.50 E:0.100768 |  and he spotted Rian Brewster with the run at the far post.
[1611.60 - 1615.60] P:1844.68 E:0.103325 |  The ball evading everyone, and it was easy for Brewster just tap-home to make it.
[1615.60 - 1618.60] P:1681.77 E:0.090604 |  Millwall-Nill, sorry, Sheffield United won.
[1618.60 - 1623.60] P:1577.39 E:0.089925 |  Sheffield United coming into that on an eight-match unbeaten run,
[1623.60 - 1628.60] P:1538.49 E:0.097773 |  really pushing for a return to the Premier League this season.
[1628.60 - 1633.60] P:1625.88 E:0.092964 |  I think under Chris Wilder, one would expect that they will sustain that this season.
[1633.60 - 1635.60] P:1545.04 E:0.095799 |  Here is Coopminers.
[1635.60 - 1639.60] P:1659.48 E:0.109662 |  He's given it away, there's a little slip there from Yildiz.
[1639.60 - 1642.60] P:1534.03 E:0.097843 |  Not as bad as Cucarera at the weekend, but it didn't help him.
[1642.60 - 1644.60] P:1573.74 E:0.092512 |  Manchester City back in possession.
[1644.60 - 1647.60] P:1485.09 E:0.092966 |  Actually, that was Coopminers' mistake there.
[1647.60 - 1650.60] P:1561.82 E:0.095085 |  They should pass through the feet there and the players running towards you.
[1650.60 - 1654.60] P:1586.26 E:0.088911 |  Again, they constantly played through that little press at Manchester City,
[1654.60 - 1657.60] P:1657.80 E:0.082573 |  tried to put it on, and it was very noticeable.
[1657.60 - 1661.60] P:1360.87 E:0.098009 |  Teams in the past never believed that they could get through that press.
[1661.60 - 1663.60] P:1482.28 E:0.098439 |  You'd be like, hey, how could we do that?
[1663.60 - 1666.60] P:1483.61 E:0.089653 |  There's not enough energy to get close to us.
[1666.60 - 1669.60] P:1785.35 E:0.085554 |  Stuttgart have pegged it back against Young Boys.
[1669.60 - 1673.60] P:1325.74 E:0.087160 |  Stuttgart won, Young Boys won.
[1673.60 - 1676.60] P:1531.84 E:0.097055 |  Lewis back to Grealish.
[1676.60 - 1679.60] P:1536.68 E:0.096935 |  Grealish then played all the way back to Cavadio.
[1679.60 - 1682.60] P:1773.51 E:0.099752 |  Yes, Ruben Diaz, when he was speaking to us last night,
[1682.60 - 1684.60] P:1597.45 E:0.099286 |  actually used the phrase, back to basics,
[1684.60 - 1688.60] P:1546.21 E:0.101203 |  which Stephen Warnock, who was on the programme on Five Live earlier,
[1688.60 - 1690.60] P:1668.60 E:0.093316 |  said it's an old footballing phrase.
[1690.60 - 1692.60] P:1819.29 E:0.099691 |  I remember it as an old political phrase.
[1692.60 - 1695.60] P:1586.75 E:0.087922 |  Do you remember John Major talking about back to basics?
[1695.60 - 1700.60] P:1452.86 E:0.093289 |  It certainly was in football in Mexico many, many years before that as well,
[1700.60 - 1703.60] P:1486.69 E:0.089595 |  because you're having a bad time playing simple passes.
[1703.60 - 1705.60] P:1552.80 E:0.102960 |  Everyone's taught at a very early age,
[1705.60 - 1707.60] P:1440.99 E:0.096256 |  and getting yourself back into the game,
[1707.60 - 1709.60] P:1364.64 E:0.098150 |  getting back into competence when you're losing it.
[1709.60 - 1711.60] P:1305.38 E:0.098651 |  And the spirit of our players, that Manchester City,
[1711.60 - 1713.60] P:1403.04 E:0.097713 |  said, can you do that?
[1713.60 - 1715.60] P:1471.60 E:0.094384 |  I think Ruben Diaz knows a lot.
[1715.60 - 1717.60] P:1609.88 E:0.103169 |  I'm not sure he knows about John Major.
[1717.60 - 1720.60] P:1744.81 E:0.106153 |  Dooku bringing the ball in field, but it went down.
[1720.60 - 1722.60] P:1637.38 E:0.099249 |  No free kick.
[1722.60 - 1725.60] P:1742.30 E:0.107655 |  And now, here, turning dangerously as Yildiz,
[1725.60 - 1727.60] P:1753.82 E:0.117672 |  who slips the ball forward to Glavich.
[1727.60 - 1730.60] P:1843.38 E:0.108088 |  The angle is tight, he works it back across goal,
[1730.60 - 1734.60] P:1817.49 E:0.101141 |  but dribbles into the six-yard box, where Edison's able to pick it up.
[1734.60 - 1737.60] P:1818.72 E:0.102954 |  Gorgeous little flash from Yildiz there, wasn't it?
[1737.60 - 1740.60] P:1775.80 E:0.095034 |  He's got a dummy, he's got Gundum on him.
[1740.60 - 1744.60] P:1735.46 E:0.086802 |  He's just done him, and there was no way in the world that Gundum was going to catch him.
[1744.60 - 1746.60] P:1719.89 E:0.090795 |  Absolutely not a chance in the world there.
[1746.60 - 1748.60] P:1638.96 E:0.097759 |  That was through ball, looking for Glavich.
[1748.60 - 1750.60] P:1654.94 E:0.078021 |  Couldn't quite get it under control.
[1750.60 - 1751.60] P:1810.74 E:0.107196 |  That's an interesting one.
[1751.60 - 1754.60] P:1623.04 E:0.100928 |  From young Kenan Yildiz, the 19-year-old,
[1754.60 - 1757.60] P:1586.88 E:0.093469 |  who plays on the left-hand side going forward,
[1757.60 - 1759.60] P:1665.42 E:0.094944 |  but there, he was in a central position,
[1759.60 - 1762.60] P:1575.74 E:0.098503 |  and they say that's where they want to see him.
[1762.60 - 1764.60] P:1624.04 E:0.091142 |  Oh, absolutely, that's where he's going to end up.
[1764.60 - 1766.60] P:1488.67 E:0.093914 |  You can tell with the type of play he has,
[1766.60 - 1769.60] P:1569.62 E:0.079944 |  but as John, he's understanding the game,
[1769.60 - 1773.60] P:1398.11 E:0.097704 |  he's been around already in Germany, but what a special talent.
[1773.60 - 1776.60] P:1423.97 E:0.096113 |  Done two things so far in this game, probably two of the best things we've seen so far.
[1776.60 - 1780.60] P:1539.18 E:0.110983 |  Yeah, Turkish international, you'll remember him probably from the Euros,
[1780.60 - 1783.60] P:1452.35 E:0.100879 |  and as Pat suggested, German Bohn, one of the German Bohn,
[1783.60 - 1787.60] P:1407.27 E:0.096932 |  Turkish contingent, just like Ilgay Gunduan on the other side.
[1787.60 - 1791.60] P:1536.39 E:0.101557 |  But it was by a Munich youngster before he came to the Juventus Academy,
[1791.60 - 1793.60] P:1541.83 E:0.099084 |  so that is Kenan Yildiz.
[1793.60 - 1796.60] P:1613.07 E:0.100298 |  Juventus, Manchester City, nearly half an hour played.
[1796.60 - 1801.60] P:1323.31 E:0.098446 |  The Juventus fans wrapped up against the cold here,
[1801.60 - 1805.60] P:1350.18 E:0.102718 |  bouncing up and down, which is probably quite a wise thing to do.
[1805.60 - 1807.60] P:1466.18 E:0.074879 |  You wouldn't know it if you've just switched on.
[1807.60 - 1810.60] P:1652.25 E:0.084157 |  You might think Juventus have a comfortable lead,
[1810.60 - 1816.60] P:1582.90 E:0.094774 |  but we've seen not too much so far in the match to jump up and down about.
[1816.60 - 1819.60] P:1560.62 E:0.101275 |  So what about Arsenal, Monaco, Cunham McNamara?
[1819.60 - 1823.60] P:1738.69 E:0.102997 |  Arsenal, Monaco, two big chances to report for Gabriel J. Zouce,
[1823.60 - 1826.60] P:1919.31 E:0.092842 |  though two good saves, the first one especially.
[1826.60 - 1828.60] P:1760.26 E:0.109396 |  The Brazilian can drink through a hoof-long ball,
[1828.60 - 1831.60] P:1804.71 E:0.097322 |  suddenly he's one-on-one with Mijecke in the Monaco goal.
[1831.60 - 1835.60] P:1547.98 E:0.102559 |  The keeper pulls off this remarkable save, 99 times out of 100.
[1835.60 - 1837.60] P:1567.74 E:0.097112 |  Gabriel J. Zouce scores that.
[1837.60 - 1839.60] P:1425.01 E:0.108595 |  Big lead off for Monaco.
[1839.60 - 1841.60] P:1566.54 E:0.084373 |  Arsenal, Monaco, Nill.
[1841.60 - 1845.60] P:1479.32 E:0.098298 |  It is Chelsea 1-20-1 in the Women's Champions League,
[1845.60 - 1849.60] P:1445.16 E:0.097089 |  and Manchester City, good possession just outside the man.
[1849.60 - 1852.60] P:1416.98 E:0.107261 |  The Juventus penalty area, Bernardo Silva through to Walker.
[1852.60 - 1854.60] P:1549.80 E:0.091260 |  Walker's got some space, if he can pull it back,
[1854.60 - 1858.60] P:1529.90 E:0.092674 |  but there were three, four Juventus players in the path of that pullback,
[1858.60 - 1860.60] P:1523.95 E:0.099915 |  and they were able to clear it.
[1860.60 - 1863.60] P:1630.39 E:0.101058 |  And Conce Sao's going to do well with this ball, which is played behind him.
[1863.60 - 1868.60] P:1682.57 E:0.090140 |  He does actually keep it in, just in front of where Thiago Mota is standing
[1868.60 - 1872.60] P:1766.56 E:0.083034 |  in his first season as the Juventus coach after excellent work
[1872.60 - 1874.60] P:1680.94 E:0.110081 |  at Bologna in the last two seasons.
[1874.60 - 1876.60] P:1640.44 E:0.098327 |  He's got Bologna into the Champions League.
[1876.60 - 1879.60] P:1586.84 E:0.094527 |  They are playing tonight, they are struggling,
[1879.60 - 1882.60] P:1514.42 E:0.087579 |  they've got work to do to avoid elimination,
[1882.60 - 1884.60] P:1391.42 E:0.086298 |  and they are currently 0-0 with Benfica.
[1884.60 - 1886.60] P:1678.15 E:0.084398 |  They were here on Saturday, of course, Bologna.
[1886.60 - 1889.60] P:1657.24 E:0.097890 |  We're winning 2-0 before Juventus came back to make it 2-2,
[1889.60 - 1891.60] P:1782.31 E:0.094418 |  their fourth draw in a row.
[1891.60 - 1894.60] P:1791.81 E:0.103768 |  Now here is Hildes on the left-hand side, into the penalty area.
[1894.60 - 1896.60] P:1749.21 E:0.100083 |  This is dangerous, excellent block though.
[1896.60 - 1900.60] P:1753.14 E:0.101635 |  Still in the box, Diaz was able to get his body in front of that shot,
[1900.60 - 1902.60] P:1846.99 E:0.091380 |  but fine work by Hildes.
[1902.60 - 1905.60] P:1668.48 E:0.097754 |  Yeah, as I say, the best things that have happened in this game so far
[1905.60 - 1907.60] P:1751.79 E:0.100360 |  have been from Hildes.
[1907.60 - 1909.60] P:1708.69 E:0.093437 |  He gets the ball on the left-hand side there.
[1909.60 - 1911.60] P:1646.45 E:0.099814 |  It's 1-0 on 1 with Walker.
[1911.60 - 1914.60] P:1767.12 E:0.091954 |  He just cruises past him.
[1914.60 - 1916.60] P:1764.01 E:0.103736 |  He doesn't have to do it in special.
[1916.60 - 1918.60] P:1750.20 E:0.104846 |  He just cruises beyond Kyle Walker there.
[1918.60 - 1920.60] P:1729.37 E:0.095537 |  And it's such an unusual thing.
[1920.60 - 1922.60] P:1584.68 E:0.084731 |  See from Kyle Walker,
[1922.60 - 1924.60] P:1497.96 E:0.106693 |  the possibility of a hand ball,
[1924.60 - 1926.60] P:1567.84 E:0.086002 |  they might have been looking at there, but...
[1926.60 - 1928.60] P:1720.59 E:0.096808 |  I think the flag might have been up there.
[1928.60 - 1929.60] P:1705.31 E:0.086836 |  It was before, yeah.
[1929.60 - 1931.60] P:1852.89 E:0.100248 |  Although, he's saying that, it's a goal kick.
[1931.60 - 1933.60] P:1890.02 E:0.101264 |  Yeah, it was a very, very tight one,
[1933.60 - 1936.60] P:1749.39 E:0.086162 |  but when the shot was that, it did hit off a Manchester City arm,
[1936.60 - 1938.60] P:1654.00 E:0.095220 |  but it was under the limit, it was close,
[1938.60 - 1941.60] P:1618.04 E:0.083947 |  and it was not in a strange position.
[1942.60 - 1947.60] P:1502.53 E:0.098020 |  0-0 here in Turin, still 0-0 at the Emirates.
[1947.60 - 1950.60] P:1611.10 E:0.103905 |  And it is half-time now at Millwall, Aaron Paul.
[1950.60 - 1952.60] P:1770.45 E:0.113184 |  Millwall 0-0, Sheffield United 1,
[1952.60 - 1954.60] P:1801.06 E:0.094954 |  Rian Brewster's first goal in 27 months,
[1954.60 - 1957.60] P:1800.07 E:0.090540 |  separates the two sides, but it's been a pretty balanced affair.
[1957.60 - 1959.60] P:1680.20 E:0.102125 |  The visitors have controlled possession,
[1959.60 - 1961.60] P:1751.41 E:0.095345 |  but Millwall had the better of the chances.
[1961.60 - 1963.60] P:1753.14 E:0.097565 |  Tanganga and Savile hit the post.
[1963.60 - 1965.60] P:1751.93 E:0.085901 |  Aziz has forced a good save from Michael Cooper,
[1965.60 - 1967.60] P:1697.82 E:0.110058 |  but it's a tap-in finish created by Gustavo Harmer.
[1967.60 - 1970.60] P:1734.30 E:0.100812 |  And finished by Rian Brewster, that's the difference of the break.
[1970.60 - 1972.60] P:1782.92 E:0.098190 |  Millwall 0-0, Sheffield United 1.
[1972.60 - 1974.60] P:1786.70 E:0.089467 |  You enter us on the attack.
[1974.60 - 1976.60] P:1724.93 E:0.096695 |  Turin has misplaced that quite badly.
[1978.60 - 1981.60] P:1732.14 E:0.099486 |  Past it. I'm not sure he was anticipating the run of Yildiz.
[1981.60 - 1984.60] P:1692.67 E:0.082341 |  It just didn't come, and it was probably 25 yards ahead of him
[1984.60 - 1986.60] P:1612.02 E:0.092707 |  and out of play for a throw-in.
[1986.60 - 1988.60] P:1721.64 E:0.090543 |  I think maybe Trego to Vyovic and play with the outside,
[1988.60 - 1992.60] P:1756.26 E:0.084880 |  he's right foot, problem is, played it with N-80s foot.
[1992.60 - 1994.60] P:1623.48 E:0.095067 |  Wrong side of foot, exactly.
[1994.60 - 1997.60] P:1860.56 E:0.089327 |  Issue. I mentioned Chelsea 1-21 in the Women's Champions League.
[1997.60 - 2000.60] P:1765.82 E:0.091028 |  It is now Celtic-Nil Real Madrid 1,
[2000.60 - 2002.60] P:1596.42 E:0.090877 |  and Chelsea are back in front.
[2002.60 - 2007.60] P:1707.17 E:0.069322 |  Rian Jean-François making it Chelsea 2-21,
[2007.60 - 2009.60] P:1552.55 E:0.066383 |  if that makes sense.
[2011.60 - 2013.60] P:1682.37 E:0.086154 |  To me, it wasn't that. To me, numbers in that.
[2013.60 - 2020.60] P:1793.07 E:0.093973 |  Here is Lewis, the referee blocks Coop Miners,
[2020.60 - 2022.60] P:1825.73 E:0.095031 |  and then blows his whistle,
[2023.60 - 2027.60] P:1815.89 E:0.095022 |  and makes out that he got winded by Coop Miners.
[2028.60 - 2031.60] P:1726.21 E:0.080012 |  And I think that might have been a...
[2031.60 - 2036.60] P:1784.86 E:0.085983 |  He's had the technology, which has then jammed into his back.
[2036.60 - 2038.60] P:1726.52 E:0.084366 |  Yeah, but also because of that collision,
[2038.60 - 2040.60] P:1744.48 E:0.104936 |  Manchester City were away on the attack there.
[2040.60 - 2042.60] P:1567.04 E:0.070598 |  They had to stop it.
[2042.60 - 2044.60] P:1682.37 E:0.083582 |  Probably a wise move.
[2044.60 - 2046.60] P:1460.72 E:0.084369 |  Yeah, no, I had to stop that.
[2046.60 - 2048.60] P:1544.58 E:0.097581 |  The ball wasn't touched by the referee,
[2048.60 - 2050.60] P:1545.92 E:0.099134 |  but it was a massive interference in the play.
[2050.60 - 2052.60] P:1564.75 E:0.081901 |  The new favour on the ball there,
[2052.60 - 2054.60] P:1391.50 E:0.067245 |  so it was the right thing to do to stop it.
[2054.60 - 2056.60] P:1634.01 E:0.100299 |  So half-time at Millwall,
[2056.60 - 2059.60] P:1754.00 E:0.095462 |  running through the half-times in the other 7.45 kick-offs
[2059.60 - 2060.60] P:1741.13 E:0.074219 |  in the championship.
[2060.60 - 2063.60] P:1565.41 E:0.090389 |  Not many goals around in the five matches.
[2063.60 - 2066.60] P:1602.62 E:0.099951 |  Still Cardiff Nill, Preston Nill,
[2066.60 - 2069.60] P:1693.75 E:0.080318 |  Hull City Nill, Watford Nill,
[2069.60 - 2073.60] P:1639.97 E:0.097731 |  in what is Ruben Sellers' first match as the manager.
[2073.60 - 2075.60] P:1742.87 E:0.101871 |  The other scores in the moment,
[2075.60 - 2077.60] P:1934.41 E:0.091690 |  but first to Arsenal because...
[2077.60 - 2080.60] P:1741.51 E:0.115979 |  Arsenal have taken the lead, 12 minutes ahead of half-time.
[2080.60 - 2082.60] P:1639.72 E:0.106426 |  Bukai Osaka was there to finish.
[2082.60 - 2084.60] P:1840.47 E:0.105785 |  The cross came from Gabriel Jézus,
[2084.60 - 2088.60] P:1827.23 E:0.110669 |  but this was all created by 18-year-old Miles Lewis-Skelly.
[2088.60 - 2090.60] P:1831.02 E:0.112334 |  Drop to shoulder, beat a defender,
[2090.60 - 2093.60] P:1745.53 E:0.109549 |  played the through ball for Gabriel Jézus,
[2093.60 - 2097.60] P:1853.04 E:0.108039 |  and Arsenal take the lead against Monaco.
[2097.60 - 2100.60] P:1606.50 E:0.096237 |  So Arsenal are in front,
[2100.60 - 2103.60] P:1481.22 E:0.092851 |  and it's Bukai Osaka on the mark again.
[2103.60 - 2105.60] P:1600.82 E:0.101694 |  The other half-time score in the championship,
[2105.60 - 2109.60] P:1632.97 E:0.097454 |  it is QPR Nill, Oxford Nill,
[2109.60 - 2111.60] P:1486.02 E:0.088323 |  both of the struggleers in the championship.
[2111.60 - 2113.60] P:1679.79 E:0.098682 |  I love QPR showing some form recently,
[2113.60 - 2116.60] P:1730.93 E:0.098297 |  and as we heard from Aaron Millwall, Nill, Sheffield United.
[2117.60 - 2120.60] P:1413.99 E:0.088132 |  One Nill-Nill here in Turin,
[2120.60 - 2123.60] P:1510.09 E:0.090314 |  where in terms of thrills and spells, it's been a little disappointing.
[2123.60 - 2125.60] P:1288.58 E:0.106621 |  It's a wee bit disappointing,
[2125.60 - 2128.60] P:1572.89 E:0.088605 |  but it's an interesting game, tactically.
[2128.60 - 2131.60] P:1539.10 E:0.096952 |  None of the man-side players really have shown
[2131.60 - 2133.60] P:1771.28 E:0.075037 |  and done anything special.
[2133.60 - 2136.60] P:1678.49 E:0.085386 |  Again, that kind of tiredness, that slight uncertainty,
[2136.60 - 2141.60] P:1573.13 E:0.089035 |  that slight lack of spark and belief in playing the ball forward
[2141.60 - 2142.60] P:1436.01 E:0.084480 |  at a moment's notice.
[2142.60 - 2144.60] P:1483.58 E:0.090644 |  You don't get a lot of time.
[2144.60 - 2146.60] P:1390.44 E:0.104928 |  Very special passes, only one for a millisecond.
[2146.60 - 2148.60] P:1434.47 E:0.088780 |  You don't have time to think,
[2148.60 - 2150.60] P:1483.85 E:0.097906 |  oh, should we take that chance?
[2150.60 - 2151.60] P:1520.17 E:0.080221 |  You've got to take it.
[2151.60 - 2154.60] P:1561.58 E:0.090913 |  Not really doing it, just too concentrated on
[2154.60 - 2156.60] P:1566.90 E:0.094579 |  making sure they do the simple thing,
[2156.60 - 2159.60] P:1410.24 E:0.082360 |  which is exactly what Pep asked him to do.
[2159.60 - 2163.60] P:1367.73 E:0.103116 |  Arsenal with Lewis, middle of the eventous half.
[2163.60 - 2166.60] P:1401.54 E:0.093766 |  Lifts a pass out to Dockoo on the left.
[2166.60 - 2169.60] P:1558.25 E:0.093603 |  Dockoo back to Lewis, who makes himself available,
[2169.60 - 2172.60] P:1312.34 E:0.091540 |  turns, and then Gundawan, Dubriona,
[2172.60 - 2175.60] P:1557.87 E:0.079593 |  23 yards out, Dubriona, one touch,
[2175.60 - 2178.60] P:1632.78 E:0.092457 |  then a second touch to Bernardo Silva, back to Dubriona.
[2178.60 - 2180.60] P:1698.69 E:0.103871 |  In comes the ball, looking for Harlott, comes back to Harlott,
[2180.60 - 2182.60] P:1538.06 E:0.095715 |  via a deflection off a defender.
[2182.60 - 2184.60] P:1537.02 E:0.102326 |  Then he went for a snapshot,
[2184.60 - 2186.60] P:1453.56 E:0.101727 |  but he didn't really get any power behind it.
[2186.60 - 2188.60] P:1572.83 E:0.110707 |  A goalkeeper, D. Gregorio has it again.
[2188.60 - 2190.60] P:1246.98 E:0.114655 |  And it gives you the story of what you know can happen
[2190.60 - 2191.60] P:1412.85 E:0.090938 |  for Manchester City.
[2191.60 - 2193.60] P:1405.95 E:0.097221 |  You get with Dubriona, very little involved in the game.
[2193.60 - 2195.60] P:1587.99 E:0.098645 |  Two or three times he's got the ball,
[2195.60 - 2197.60] P:1608.06 E:0.079141 |  in decent crossing positions.
[2197.60 - 2201.60] P:1499.86 E:0.096759 |  He's put an OK ball in, but you see Dubriona is best.
[2201.60 - 2204.60] P:1515.67 E:0.095343 |  He doesn't put an OK ball in there.
[2204.60 - 2206.60] P:1490.62 E:0.096963 |  He puts a vicious one in there.
[2206.60 - 2208.60] P:1412.95 E:0.095407 |  It's almost impossible to defend,
[2208.60 - 2211.60] P:1260.42 E:0.098022 |  and it's not quite spanking for the other,
[2211.60 - 2213.60] P:1353.90 E:0.093720 |  Dubriona, Dubriona, yet.
[2213.60 - 2215.60] P:1544.65 E:0.077396 |  So it is 0-0.
[2215.60 - 2219.60] P:1511.63 E:0.087747 |  By the way, that Pukajosaka goal in the live Champions League table
[2219.60 - 2224.60] P:1534.63 E:0.090040 |  has taken Arsenal back up into the top eight,
[2224.60 - 2227.60] P:1669.08 E:0.089905 |  where you would qualify directly for the round of 16.
[2227.60 - 2230.60] P:1748.89 E:0.086389 |  So Arsenal currently fifth in that live table.
[2230.60 - 2232.60] P:1688.38 E:0.087355 |  Lewis, then Grealish.
[2232.60 - 2234.60] P:1887.02 E:0.091818 |  He has Harlan from the angle, crosses,
[2234.60 - 2237.60] P:1842.32 E:0.104079 |  via deflection, and then two rounds in position
[2237.60 - 2240.60] P:1711.89 E:0.090749 |  to chest it back to his goalkeeper.
[2240.60 - 2243.60] P:1610.17 E:0.102215 |  And then, out, come you've entered,
[2243.60 - 2247.60] P:1788.46 E:0.096709 |  but Manchester City have got possession back again.
[2247.60 - 2249.60] P:1831.93 E:0.100869 |  It's good to see Grealish doing what Grealish did there.
[2249.60 - 2251.60] P:1776.44 E:0.086266 |  When you go out the ball in that position,
[2251.60 - 2255.60] P:1382.01 E:0.087458 |  you know, one of the two 10s behind Harlan,
[2255.60 - 2256.60] P:1581.96 E:0.085873 |  but he's facing forward,
[2256.60 - 2258.60] P:1574.49 E:0.103517 |  and the amount of times that Grealish gets the ball,
[2258.60 - 2261.60] P:1639.97 E:0.101160 |  and his first movement is back towards his own goal.
[2261.60 - 2264.60] P:1539.36 E:0.099378 |  That team's first movement is towards the opposition goal.
[2264.60 - 2266.60] P:1565.68 E:0.098822 |  It looks a different player.
[2266.60 - 2268.60] P:1496.88 E:0.105267 |  He looks so much better.
[2268.60 - 2271.60] P:1456.69 E:0.088573 |  He looks like the player he wasn't asking for.
[2271.60 - 2273.60] P:1474.94 E:0.087839 |  So much, much better from Grealish there.
[2273.60 - 2276.60] P:1570.36 E:0.089299 |  Chelsea now three-one up on 20
[2276.60 - 2278.60] P:1520.23 E:0.096707 |  in the Women's Champions League group,
[2278.60 - 2280.60] P:1510.96 E:0.098455 |  from which they have already qualified.
[2280.60 - 2283.60] P:1667.60 E:0.088715 |  Maya Ramirez with the third goal,
[2283.60 - 2287.60] P:1568.13 E:0.070884 |  still Celtic nil, Real Madrid one,
[2287.60 - 2289.60] P:1708.84 E:0.092296 |  and Manchester City have got possession back.
[2289.60 - 2291.60] P:1702.56 E:0.090819 |  They've absolutely dominated the possession
[2291.60 - 2293.60] P:1765.08 E:0.094765 |  in the old style of Manchester City,
[2293.60 - 2295.60] P:1673.16 E:0.106176 |  if we can put it in those terms.
[2295.60 - 2297.60] P:1818.92 E:0.087169 |  As it's played forward to Harlan,
[2297.60 - 2299.60] P:1662.49 E:0.096471 |  Harlan with the flick out to the far side,
[2299.60 - 2301.60] P:1778.24 E:0.087834 |  but Dignilore has got that comfortably back.
[2301.60 - 2303.60] P:1643.87 E:0.093156 |  The veteran as he is now,
[2303.60 - 2305.60] P:1653.00 E:0.103011 |  Brazilian international,
[2305.60 - 2307.60] P:1789.22 E:0.104585 |  forward it goes to Kupnikers.
[2307.60 - 2310.60] P:1773.39 E:0.097793 |  Then Vlavač comes out of the penalty area.
[2310.60 - 2312.60] P:1813.77 E:0.086741 |  His challenge goes down, gets back up,
[2312.60 - 2314.60] P:1684.36 E:0.078528 |  Lokatelli at the yield is.
[2314.60 - 2316.60] P:1743.99 E:0.105776 |  Now he has two ram,
[2316.60 - 2318.60] P:1715.72 E:0.108997 |  and the outside flag is up against Gieltis,
[2318.60 - 2320.60] P:1790.67 E:0.088528 |  which is a little careless.
[2320.60 - 2322.60] P:1672.38 E:0.103492 |  It's a bit of a shame that because this one
[2322.60 - 2324.60] P:1677.08 E:0.081965 |  better moves that they've had in the game.
[2324.60 - 2327.60] P:1523.65 E:0.087045 |  Gielta is getting on the ball in that far side there.
[2327.60 - 2329.60] P:1524.45 E:0.077828 |  Yeah, I see Manchester City,
[2329.60 - 2331.60] P:1431.98 E:0.116884 |  they have got a lot of possession,
[2331.60 - 2333.60] P:1499.03 E:0.080699 |  but the best in Manchester City,
[2333.60 - 2336.60] P:1528.85 E:0.097463 |  they have possession almost like a basketball court
[2336.60 - 2338.60] P:1554.76 E:0.099858 |  round the 18 yard line in the opposition.
[2338.60 - 2340.60] P:1604.52 E:0.095244 |  It's not kind of being like that, has it?
[2340.60 - 2342.60] P:1481.74 E:0.093040 |  I mean, they've got some good possession,
[2342.60 - 2344.60] P:1474.71 E:0.082911 |  but they have a lot of possession with a lot of your teams.
[2344.60 - 2346.60] P:1404.62 E:0.075751 |  But a lot of team is preying,
[2346.60 - 2348.60] P:1301.74 E:0.076290 |  so, you know, Anadain,
[2348.60 - 2350.60] P:1446.34 E:0.086782 |  midfield stuff, isn't it?
[2350.60 - 2351.60] P:1287.22 E:0.071878 |  It is.
[2351.60 - 2353.60] P:1506.08 E:0.101712 |  Juventus nil, Manchester City nil,
[2353.60 - 2355.60] P:1535.50 E:0.081909 |  Arsenal winning 1-0,
[2355.60 - 2357.60] P:1663.79 E:0.092170 |  to the sacca goal,
[2357.60 - 2359.60] P:1580.84 E:0.084991 |  Guardiol steps forward and heads it down for Docky.
[2359.60 - 2362.60] P:1421.98 E:0.089852 |  Here is Grealich, who's for the moment,
[2362.60 - 2364.60] P:1583.70 E:0.092177 |  on the left-hand side, he's challenged by Constiçao,
[2364.60 - 2366.60] P:1433.63 E:0.086062 |  went down quite theatrically.
[2366.60 - 2369.60] P:1703.39 E:0.114544 |  Play continues, Harlan now in from DiBairno,
[2369.60 - 2371.60] P:1766.85 E:0.106071 |  and the goalkeeper flung up an arm
[2371.60 - 2373.60] P:1800.10 E:0.096553 |  and made a very decent save, actually.
[2373.60 - 2375.60] P:1725.58 E:0.102818 |  Tried to dink it over him,
[2375.60 - 2378.60] P:1656.61 E:0.105854 |  and Di Gregorio was able to make a reaction save.
[2378.60 - 2380.60] P:1625.15 E:0.098704 |  The goal was a big mess, though,
[2380.60 - 2382.60] P:1721.07 E:0.099002 |  but I don't know if it is a big mess.
[2382.60 - 2384.60] P:1727.94 E:0.100670 |  I think he did everything right, he's checked the goalkeeper,
[2384.60 - 2386.60] P:1787.29 E:0.107855 |  he's just got a big talk, then saved it.
[2386.60 - 2388.60] P:1917.80 E:0.097995 |  Manchester City's biggest chance so far,
[2388.60 - 2391.60] P:1899.64 E:0.103130 |  still 0-0, Constiçao now down the other end.
[2391.60 - 2395.60] P:1801.66 E:0.081220 |  Suddenly, it's turning more dramatic,
[2395.60 - 2398.60] P:1865.44 E:0.098655 |  as Danilo tries a shot against this old club
[2398.60 - 2400.60] P:1761.03 E:0.092189 |  with 25 yards, but with that shot,
[2400.60 - 2403.60] P:1713.92 E:0.095291 |  it was easy for Edison just to take a step to his left
[2403.60 - 2405.60] P:1577.99 E:0.097853 |  and grab it into his chest.
[2405.60 - 2408.60] P:1623.30 E:0.098988 |  But by some distance, the best opportunity of the game there,
[2408.60 - 2410.60] P:1410.55 E:0.100457 |  from Harlan, I should be really impressed
[2410.60 - 2412.60] P:1345.15 E:0.101903 |  by Harlan's movement in the game,
[2412.60 - 2416.60] P:1495.48 E:0.096962 |  probably the best movement of any Manchester City player.
[2416.60 - 2418.60] P:1514.46 E:0.099545 |  He's not getting the ball very often,
[2418.60 - 2420.60] P:1614.52 E:0.092211 |  but he's always getting in the position.
[2420.60 - 2422.60] P:1413.03 E:0.101136 |  Twice he's managed to get there, this time he got it.
[2422.60 - 2425.60] P:1568.97 E:0.091552 |  Tried to flick the keeper, and I think he's really unlucky.
[2425.60 - 2427.60] P:1636.01 E:0.083394 |  I've put that down at great stage.
[2427.60 - 2430.60] P:1517.35 E:0.106252 |  So Juventus, Niel, Manchester City now back to Arsenal,
[2430.60 - 2431.60] P:1347.42 E:0.099419 |  Conor McNamara.
[2431.60 - 2434.60] P:1721.29 E:0.113766 |  Still Arsenal, one, Monaco, 0-0, it should be 2-0,
[2434.60 - 2436.60] P:1542.15 E:0.106961 |  though Martin Odegaard bouncing on a defensive error,
[2436.60 - 2438.60] P:1488.49 E:0.105788 |  through 1-1 with the goalkeeper,
[2438.60 - 2440.60] P:1530.75 E:0.100844 |  agonisingly for Arsenal, put it wide.
[2440.60 - 2443.60] P:1595.75 E:0.107009 |  It's Prokajosakos' goal that separates them.
[2443.60 - 2445.60] P:1670.85 E:0.096992 |  Arsenal, one, Monaco, 0-0.
[2445.60 - 2447.60] P:1834.79 E:0.080468 |  Another goal for Chelsea's women,
[2447.60 - 2449.60] P:1631.62 E:0.092699 |  Aaron Cuthbert, 4-1, nearly 20,
[2449.60 - 2451.60] P:1532.74 E:0.086981 |  as Juventus bring the ball away
[2451.60 - 2454.60] P:1709.62 E:0.091126 |  and Constiçao flicks it out of Dooku.
[2454.60 - 2456.60] P:1647.20 E:0.079786 |  Thiago Mota comes forward.
[2456.60 - 2458.60] P:1703.68 E:0.096913 |  Oh, did he?
[2458.60 - 2461.60] P:1692.81 E:0.094892 |  Yeah, and Thiago Mota actually almost stepped onto the pitch there
[2461.60 - 2463.60] P:1511.97 E:0.089898 |  to slap him on the back.
[2463.60 - 2466.60] P:1550.08 E:0.076710 |  Constiçao, you know, it wouldn't surprise me at all
[2466.60 - 2470.60] P:1462.58 E:0.082479 |  if he's the kind of young player who needs encouragement.
[2470.60 - 2472.60] P:1766.53 E:0.096088 |  And that's what he's got from his manager there.
[2472.60 - 2474.60] P:1637.79 E:0.095477 |  Absolutely, because it's one of those things,
[2474.60 - 2476.60] P:1594.01 E:0.075952 |  you can get inside his head, the thing about Constiçao,
[2476.60 - 2478.60] P:1781.88 E:0.098516 |  there is a lot of talent there.
[2478.60 - 2480.60] P:1428.57 E:0.085500 |  There's a massive amount of talent.
[2480.60 - 2482.60] P:1513.49 E:0.096623 |  There's a good deal of speed as well.
[2482.60 - 2484.60] P:1325.20 E:0.097218 |  1-1 with defenders, he's fabulous,
[2484.60 - 2486.60] P:1641.36 E:0.088527 |  but he has to keep his head right.
[2486.60 - 2488.60] P:1717.58 E:0.104046 |  Yes, and as I said,
[2488.60 - 2490.60] P:1773.64 E:0.091824 |  Challenge is Dooku, that's a foul.
[2490.60 - 2492.60] P:1581.89 E:0.093829 |  It's a free kick from Manchester City.
[2492.60 - 2496.60] P:1528.11 E:0.112515 |  And actually, the two of them have stood up
[2496.60 - 2498.60] P:1738.59 E:0.111995 |  and have squared up,
[2498.60 - 2502.60] P:1840.34 E:0.106074 |  not aggressively, it's just a sort of posturing.
[2502.60 - 2505.60] P:1800.50 E:0.106569 |  Referee Turpan has gone in between them,
[2505.60 - 2508.60] P:1768.31 E:0.095452 |  and they're still speaking to one another,
[2508.60 - 2511.60] P:1680.46 E:0.099655 |  even though the referee is there, they're a team mate as well.
[2511.60 - 2513.60] P:1575.76 E:0.089613 |  And then the burner just walks between them,
[2513.60 - 2515.60] P:1696.86 E:0.098079 |  Loca Telly is involved also.
[2515.60 - 2517.60] P:1507.64 E:0.095124 |  And let's see whether the referee
[2517.60 - 2520.60] P:1450.01 E:0.103592 |  does actually take any action against the two players.
[2520.60 - 2523.60] P:1302.63 E:0.096089 |  Um, this is made to do so much out to them.
[2523.60 - 2525.60] P:1196.61 E:0.093397 |  Wingers, honestly.
[2525.60 - 2527.60] P:1374.40 E:0.090515 |  Handbats.
[2527.60 - 2529.60] P:1282.49 E:0.094549 |  Nothing going on there.
[2529.60 - 2531.60] P:1432.68 E:0.110006 |  I think when it was, it was a rubbish tackle,
[2531.60 - 2532.60] P:1723.35 E:0.091653 |  really, but Constiçao.
[2532.60 - 2534.60] P:1760.80 E:0.089835 |  They're funny sorts, aren't they, Wingers?
[2534.60 - 2536.60] P:1387.42 E:0.088769 |  Yeah, I never trust them.
[2536.60 - 2537.60] P:1637.85 E:0.097082 |  Not to be trusted.
[2537.60 - 2539.60] P:1511.98 E:0.091240 |  And they can't tackle either.
[2539.60 - 2540.60] P:1629.98 E:0.077524 |  No, famously.
[2540.60 - 2541.60] P:1603.67 E:0.099705 |  And that's it.
[2541.60 - 2544.60] P:1474.15 E:0.094178 |  Well, I must say, if, um...
[2546.60 - 2550.60] P:1564.47 E:0.106104 |  Francisco Constiçao is anything like his dad, Sergio,
[2550.60 - 2552.60] P:1488.51 E:0.104822 |  the former coach of Porto,
[2552.60 - 2554.60] P:1490.47 E:0.096366 |  who always used to have plenty to say for himself.
[2554.60 - 2557.60] P:1260.29 E:0.099706 |  Yes, I think he has got work to say for himself.
[2557.60 - 2558.60] P:1614.79 E:0.112038 |  Yeah, he is.
[2558.60 - 2560.60] P:1602.61 E:0.091572 |  He is something like his father.
[2560.60 - 2564.60] P:1564.62 E:0.091714 |  Currently not in work, but I'm sure we'll see you again soon.
[2564.60 - 2567.60] P:1646.12 E:0.098582 |  Halftime approaching here after half a few chances,
[2567.60 - 2570.60] P:1399.34 E:0.094501 |  but Manchester City with a set-piece opportunity.
[2570.60 - 2572.60] P:994.50 E:0.093697 |  Still 0-0.
[2572.60 - 2574.60] P:1425.15 E:0.101244 |  De Bruyne into the near post,
[2574.60 - 2576.60] P:1334.20 E:0.087733 |  and across comes two-around.
[2576.60 - 2578.60] P:1707.43 E:0.099382 |  And amongst two other Juventus players there,
[2578.60 - 2580.60] P:1361.39 E:0.092653 |  it's another corner, another set-piece.
[2580.60 - 2581.60] P:1284.64 E:0.088990 |  It's not great though, is it?
[2581.60 - 2584.60] P:1374.01 E:0.085711 |  I mean, that, you know, De Bruyne is one of the best
[2584.60 - 2587.60] P:1548.78 E:0.085192 |  we've ever seen in the Premier League in delivery.
[2587.60 - 2589.60] P:1636.06 E:0.093796 |  And the deliveries have been kind of a bit flocking,
[2589.60 - 2591.60] P:1618.02 E:0.079840 |  you know, just kind of dinked in there.
[2591.60 - 2593.60] P:1408.72 E:0.101023 |  You need to whip them in there.
[2593.60 - 2595.60] P:1404.24 E:0.093127 |  You need to put it in and ask a defender a question.
[2595.60 - 2597.60] P:1445.49 E:0.090890 |  It's a good thing, you know,
[2597.60 - 2600.60] P:1334.09 E:0.103453 |  that they're going to give you the attack or something, the attack.
[2600.60 - 2602.60] P:1384.91 E:0.099287 |  But they've kind of been dogged in there a little bit,
[2602.60 - 2605.60] P:1377.03 E:0.088014 |  so something to do a little bit better from this corner, Kevin.
[2605.60 - 2608.60] P:1595.17 E:0.107150 |  Floppy, like Ian Dennis, with his floppy disc
[2608.60 - 2612.60] P:1442.74 E:0.082455 |  that he was talking to us about on the commentators' view podcast
[2612.60 - 2616.60] P:1560.94 E:0.096633 |  a couple of weeks ago, which you can get on BBC Sound.
[2616.60 - 2618.60] P:1493.25 E:0.095530 |  De Bruyne takes it into the near post,
[2618.60 - 2620.60] P:1332.16 E:0.095953 |  and it's headed away for Juventus.
[2620.60 - 2622.60] P:1510.25 E:0.101662 |  Further away from Considio,
[2622.60 - 2624.60] P:1308.34 E:0.097007 |  which is down into the ground,
[2624.60 - 2626.60] P:1367.82 E:0.094802 |  and Juventus are able to clear,
[2626.60 - 2628.60] P:1472.25 E:0.104254 |  and it's all the way back to Edison at the other end.
[2628.60 - 2632.60] P:1537.13 E:0.101130 |  So Juventus, Nail Manchester City, Nail 5 Live from the BBC,
[2632.60 - 2634.60] P:1619.69 E:0.092203 |  BBC Manchester as well.
[2635.60 - 2640.60] P:1533.23 E:0.097260 |  And of course, all live BBC Radio can be listened to
[2640.60 - 2643.60] P:1429.29 E:0.098484 |  via BBC Sounds via the app, which is free.
[2643.60 - 2645.60] P:1472.63 E:0.101351 |  It can take us wherever you go,
[2645.60 - 2648.60] P:1337.73 E:0.105337 |  and indeed you can pause, rewind the action,
[2648.60 - 2650.60] P:1373.91 E:0.100459 |  listen back to our commentaries
[2650.60 - 2653.60] P:1297.78 E:0.093441 |  if you've been at any of the matches.
[2653.60 - 2655.60] P:1239.54 E:0.109098 |  I'm not sure I'd necessarily recommend you listen back
[2655.60 - 2657.60] P:1093.51 E:0.093163 |  to the first half of this.
[2657.60 - 2658.60] P:1246.65 E:0.119745 |  There is Nail Nail.
[2658.60 - 2659.60] P:1523.51 E:0.091717 |  There is no commentaries, OK, John?
[2659.60 - 2664.60] P:1618.01 E:0.086699 |  Well, I don't think that's for us to be the judge of.
[2664.60 - 2667.60] P:1515.03 E:0.093185 |  So it's Nail Nail here. Back to Conor at Arsenal.
[2667.60 - 2669.60] P:1661.27 E:0.116490 |  Well, still Arsenal lead by Colton Hill,
[2669.60 - 2671.60] P:1497.46 E:0.098813 |  but remarkable that they haven't extended this lead.
[2671.60 - 2673.60] P:1592.33 E:0.105888 |  They've had by far the most chances.
[2673.60 - 2675.60] P:1446.24 E:0.106330 |  The latest from Martin Hill, one-on-one puts it.
[2675.60 - 2678.60] P:1387.51 E:0.101056 |  Why do the post again? Arsenal won one at Gunnell.
[2678.60 - 2681.60] P:1407.62 E:0.086854 |  Actually, Conat is going to be on this week's
[2681.60 - 2683.60] P:1163.91 E:0.095895 |  The Commentators View podcast.
[2683.60 - 2686.60] P:1451.70 E:0.101855 |  Edison, long downfield from one end,
[2686.60 - 2689.60] P:1491.01 E:0.092295 |  that rather sums it up, from one goalkeeper
[2689.60 - 2692.60] P:1415.99 E:0.098387 |  to the other goalkeeper, D. Gregorio, at the other end,
[2692.60 - 2694.60] P:1671.61 E:0.098691 |  who I think has probably produced the moment of the first half
[2694.60 - 2696.60] P:1304.74 E:0.081129 |  with that save from Harlan.
[2696.60 - 2698.60] P:1359.35 E:0.094374 |  Locatelli, then two-round.
[2698.60 - 2699.60] P:1634.73 E:0.101477 |  Now, Flavec in the centre-circle.
[2699.60 - 2701.60] P:1557.32 E:0.096523 |  Flavec goes almost to full 360 degrees,
[2701.60 - 2703.60] P:1650.43 E:0.092468 |  so Krupp Meiners is furthest forward.
[2703.60 - 2705.60] P:1656.10 E:0.100391 |  Now, here's Konce Sauer again,
[2705.60 - 2707.60] P:1373.35 E:0.094167 |  just in front of where Pep Guardiola
[2707.60 - 2712.60] P:1468.96 E:0.086602 |  is watching in an extremely padded black coat.
[2712.60 - 2715.60] P:1453.20 E:0.076999 |  Now, Danilo drops back into the defence
[2715.60 - 2717.60] P:1589.57 E:0.093676 |  and Juventus have got it inside their own half,
[2717.60 - 2719.60] P:1633.79 E:0.111492 |  and we'll see the fourth official very shortly
[2719.60 - 2722.60] P:1492.32 E:0.081978 |  coming forward to show us how much time there will be.
[2722.60 - 2725.60] P:1303.46 E:0.095728 |  It's got to be one. It's got to be one minute, surely.
[2725.60 - 2726.60] P:1158.80 E:0.080934 |  Nothing's happened.
[2726.60 - 2728.60] P:1225.73 E:0.091989 |  And as I've said that, John,
[2728.60 - 2730.60] P:1425.62 E:0.090857 |  one minute of added time
[2730.60 - 2732.60] P:1388.53 E:0.100842 |  before we can get back into that bag
[2732.60 - 2735.60] P:1514.11 E:0.102041 |  that Juventus have supplied for us to see what's in it.
[2735.60 - 2741.60] P:1631.23 E:0.089392 |  Here is Turam, now to Danilo.
[2741.60 - 2744.60] P:1731.36 E:0.110185 |  And then frustration from the Juventus supporters.
[2744.60 - 2747.60] P:1768.40 E:0.097750 |  I think this was the case here for the match on Saturday
[2747.60 - 2748.60] P:1461.71 E:0.099180 |  when they were 2-0 down.
[2748.60 - 2751.60] P:1382.90 E:0.099407 |  The home crowd were booing Juventus,
[2751.60 - 2754.60] P:1664.95 E:0.105603 |  and now they're urging Turam to do something with this.
[2754.60 - 2756.60] P:1543.42 E:0.105561 |  But again, he's closed down,
[2756.60 - 2759.60] P:1675.05 E:0.099479 |  centre-field by Grealish, Milano winning 1-0
[2759.60 - 2762.60] P:1469.20 E:0.085239 |  against Red Star Belgrade,
[2762.60 - 2765.60] P:1636.60 E:0.087124 |  and he's got Trevena's Vens Derri if you prefer.
[2765.60 - 2768.60] P:1758.75 E:0.103172 |  And it's 5-0-3, Sparta Prague, one now.
[2768.60 - 2770.60] P:1813.00 E:0.108786 |  As Juventus do come forward,
[2770.60 - 2773.60] P:1833.93 E:0.099118 |  Klarvic, though, the ball is played wide for him
[2773.60 - 2775.60] P:1511.40 E:0.091038 |  to take down into the full-back position,
[2775.60 - 2777.60] P:1543.62 E:0.094844 |  locks it back to Savonac behind him,
[2777.60 - 2780.60] P:1538.09 E:0.091626 |  losing with the challenge in the city-left-back area.
[2780.60 - 2782.60] P:1692.18 E:0.111121 |  And then it's run-out with play by Docku,
[2782.60 - 2784.60] P:1662.96 E:0.094452 |  that is the throwing to the home side,
[2784.60 - 2787.60] P:1700.95 E:0.095884 |  to the two-time former European champions,
[2787.60 - 2790.60] P:1670.29 E:0.090059 |  Juventus, and Savonac's going to wait here
[2790.60 - 2791.60] P:1743.46 E:0.116644 |  for this to be taken.
[2791.60 - 2793.60] P:1805.33 E:0.111351 |  In fact, the referee says he won't be able to take it
[2793.60 - 2795.60] P:1909.82 E:0.103528 |  because there's the half-time whistle,
[2795.60 - 2797.60] P:1925.60 E:0.100801 |  and it's 0-0, Pat.
[2797.60 - 2799.60] P:1989.41 E:0.109930 |  Just a moment ago, as a frustration,
[2799.60 - 2802.60] P:1848.23 E:0.098894 |  you could hear a couple of things from the Juventus fans
[2802.60 - 2804.60] P:1663.75 E:0.090858 |  behind Manchester City goal there.
[2804.60 - 2806.60] P:1745.82 E:0.080706 |  And the frustration was,
[2806.60 - 2808.60] P:1728.09 E:0.097084 |  Manchester were playing a high-line, they had good passes,
[2808.60 - 2810.60] P:1883.26 E:0.095196 |  they were through passes on, they could trace,
[2810.60 - 2812.60] P:1778.04 E:0.071463 |  and they didn't take the chance to play it.
[2812.60 - 2814.60] P:1517.49 E:0.090052 |  They were just a little bit uncertain,
[2814.60 - 2815.60] P:1790.11 E:0.118494 |  and they showed themselves,
[2815.60 - 2818.60] P:1805.35 E:0.099131 |  look, these chances last for a millisecond,
[2818.60 - 2820.60] P:1688.29 E:0.097942 |  you've got to put it through there.
[2820.60 - 2821.60] P:1778.47 E:0.103589 |  Manchester City have had a couple,
[2821.60 - 2823.60] P:1725.15 E:0.089076 |  and they haven't played them through,
[2823.60 - 2824.60] P:1999.30 E:0.116631 |  which is so enlightening,
[2824.60 - 2826.60] P:1909.69 E:0.094109 |  because they always make the right decisions.
[2826.60 - 2828.60] P:1854.76 E:0.089775 |  When they did play that little through-ball
[2828.60 - 2829.60] P:2088.73 E:0.075475 |  from the 10th position,
[2829.60 - 2831.60] P:1923.80 E:0.095245 |  that's when they got beyond Manchester City,
[2831.60 - 2832.60] P:1855.17 E:0.091286 |  got beyond.
[2832.60 - 2834.60] P:1904.82 E:0.092404 |  Haaland had a chance, couldn't quite take it,
[2834.60 - 2836.60] P:2009.13 E:0.099563 |  and on another occasion, he was a little bit wide.
[2836.60 - 2839.60] P:2059.42 E:0.083912 |  So there's tentativeness all around,
[2839.60 - 2841.60] P:2062.54 E:0.074220 |  and it's not just Manchester City,
[2841.60 - 2843.60] P:2021.10 E:0.083124 |  it's from Juventus players as well.
[2843.60 - 2845.60] P:1997.52 E:0.073596 |  I suspect there will be chances,
[2845.60 - 2847.60] P:1849.69 E:0.072448 |  and a lot more chances in the second half
[2847.60 - 2849.60] P:1847.11 E:0.089015 |  where players are all accentured.
[2849.60 - 2851.60] P:1918.14 E:0.068954 |  Yeah, I hope you're right, Pat,
[2851.60 - 2854.60] P:1890.08 E:0.089428 |  because at half-time here in the beautiful city of Turin,
[2854.60 - 2857.60] P:1748.86 E:0.065469 |  there's Juventus-Nilm and Manchester City-Nilm.
[2857.60 - 2859.60] P:1650.74 E:0.098800 |  And Pat Levin are there for us.
[2859.60 - 2860.60] P:2030.76 E:0.111707 |  Pat, you know, before the game,
[2860.60 - 2863.60] P:1845.93 E:0.088261 |  you were pointing out that there are often cases
[2863.60 - 2865.60] P:1577.73 E:0.103462 |  where you have two teams in very good form
[2865.60 - 2866.60] P:1581.01 E:0.090231 |  who cancel each other out,
[2866.60 - 2868.60] P:1823.49 E:0.103767 |  and sometimes when it's two teams who are in
[2868.60 - 2871.60] P:1679.86 E:0.098548 |  on certain form that you get a really exciting game,
[2871.60 - 2873.60] P:1716.36 E:0.092914 |  we forgot about the third option,
[2873.60 - 2875.60] P:1451.82 E:0.099795 |  which is two teams low on confidence
[2875.60 - 2878.60] P:1785.87 E:0.095488 |  and start taking their chances of the few that they create.
[2878.60 - 2881.60] P:1897.88 E:0.086365 |  And also, on top of that, you're absolutely right with that,
[2881.60 - 2884.60] P:1823.22 E:0.079184 |  but then, I, on top of that, are scared to take risks.
[2884.60 - 2886.60] P:1928.12 E:0.095461 |  And that's what it is.
[2886.60 - 2887.60] P:2063.92 E:0.087061 |  It's the risk taking this,
[2887.60 - 2890.60] P:1848.77 E:0.081634 |  and it's the risk taking the final third of,
[2890.60 - 2892.60] P:1671.32 E:0.114801 |  you know, when Kevin De Bruyne normally gets a ball,
[2892.60 - 2894.60] P:1792.50 E:0.088164 |  and it's on for a millisecond,
[2894.60 - 2896.60] P:1766.24 E:0.097341 |  you shut your eyes, you'll play it.
[2896.60 - 2898.60] P:1681.62 E:0.079417 |  You'll see it, he's fabulous.
[2898.60 - 2900.60] P:1817.72 E:0.108486 |  It's not quite, and really similarly,
[2900.60 - 2902.60] P:1858.27 E:0.086313 |  played one of those three balls,
[2902.60 - 2904.60] P:1823.31 E:0.083194 |  but it's been on a few times,
[2904.60 - 2905.60] P:1798.68 E:0.090181 |  all the way through the pitch,
[2905.60 - 2907.60] P:1732.07 E:0.099724 |  everyone's back to that simplicity,
[2907.60 - 2910.60] P:1855.48 E:0.100669 |  which is exactly what Pep was saying before the game.
[2910.60 - 2913.60] P:1793.16 E:0.078763 |  He wanted to see, you know, simplicity and safety.
[2913.60 - 2915.60] P:1718.85 E:0.089907 |  Well, you don't make a lot of goals doing that.
[2915.60 - 2917.60] P:1894.20 E:0.092020 |  You need to take those chances,
[2917.60 - 2920.60] P:1660.10 E:0.077007 |  and, you know, I expect a little bit better in the second half,
[2920.60 - 2922.60] P:1693.32 E:0.085919 |  you know, more chances in the second half.
[2922.60 - 2924.60] P:1954.33 E:0.081327 |  Players try to take those chances,
[2924.60 - 2926.60] P:1955.05 E:0.087317 |  the good players getting on the ball.
[2926.60 - 2928.60] P:1889.89 E:0.090102 |  There's a lot of good players out there.
[2928.60 - 2930.60] P:1805.27 E:0.064016 |  Yielding is really fabulous.
[2930.60 - 2931.60] P:1724.79 E:0.105759 |  He just isn't getting enough of the ball
[2931.60 - 2932.60] P:1907.79 E:0.092292 |  on the final third.
[2932.60 - 2934.60] P:2074.22 E:0.073892 |  Yielding, of course, has got many chances.
[2934.60 - 2936.60] P:1961.84 E:0.082398 |  Blanovich, great player to watch,
[2936.60 - 2938.60] P:2086.27 E:0.095247 |  where he's at it, chasing and running everywhere,
[2938.60 - 2940.60] P:1879.85 E:0.093652 |  and we know the qualities of Manchester City
[2940.60 - 2942.60] P:1849.05 E:0.089720 |  have got going forward, but as you see,
[2942.60 - 2945.60] P:1966.11 E:0.066399 |  there's limited confidence in a lot of the players,
[2945.60 - 2947.60] P:1953.17 E:0.089559 |  particularly middle-to-front.
[2947.60 - 2949.60] P:2011.83 E:0.082034 |  Pat and John, for now,
[2949.60 - 2950.60] P:1874.45 E:0.105420 |  thank you very much.
[2950.60 - 2952.60] P:1888.58 E:0.107274 |  Hope this goes for you in the second half.
[2952.60 - 2954.60] P:1812.46 E:0.103224 |  Otherwise, the highlight is going to be finding out
[2954.60 - 2956.60] P:1600.77 E:0.083749 |  what's in the bag that Juventus have provided for them.
[2956.60 - 2958.60] P:1849.39 E:0.096109 |  That's coming up in the second half from Turin.
[2958.60 - 2960.60] P:1729.33 E:0.098760 |  Juventus, no Manchester City, 0.
[2961.60 - 2964.60] P:1801.55 E:0.105873 |  Meanwhile, at the Emirates, Arsenal taking on Monaco.
[2964.60 - 2965.60] P:1806.62 E:0.090973 |  Conor McNamara is watching.
[2965.60 - 2967.60] P:1616.09 E:0.103129 |  Arsenal won, Monaco, 0.
[2967.60 - 2972.60] P:1881.89 E:0.103177 |  Bacchio, Saka's goal, six goals in seven Champions League home games now for Saka.
[2972.60 - 2974.60] P:1832.03 E:0.096213 |  And Arsenal fans will love that Miles Lewis-Skelly
[2974.60 - 2976.60] P:1859.08 E:0.104264 |  was at the heart of creating it.
[2976.60 - 2978.60] P:1779.00 E:0.093191 |  Arteta, shorter defenders at the moment.
[2978.60 - 2982.60] P:1847.56 E:0.100791 |  He's thrust in the 18-year-old sort of hybrid full-back midfield roll.
[2982.60 - 2984.60] P:1849.57 E:0.085396 |  Lewis-Skelly rolled this tackle.
[2984.60 - 2986.60] P:1803.11 E:0.105336 |  He played a through ball to Gabriel Jouze
[2986.60 - 2988.60] P:1826.82 E:0.092573 |  that cut through the Monaco defensive line,
[2988.60 - 2991.60] P:1772.67 E:0.089417 |  and then the cross was tapped in by Bucchio Saka.
[2991.60 - 2993.60] P:1788.46 E:0.106404 |  Arsenal do deserve the lead.
[2993.60 - 2995.60] P:1881.99 E:0.088300 |  They've had by far the most chances.
[2995.60 - 2998.60] P:1769.57 E:0.098063 |  Odegaard and Martinelli can't believe they haven't added to it.
[2998.60 - 3000.60] P:1758.85 E:0.085468 |  They put one-on-one chances wide.
[3000.60 - 3003.60] P:1836.69 E:0.093549 |  And whenever Arsenal have scored first in the Champions League this season,
[3003.60 - 3005.60] P:1736.13 E:0.101429 |  they've always gone on to win the game at the break here.
[3005.60 - 3007.60] P:1728.17 E:0.095088 |  Arsenal won Monaco, 0.
[3007.60 - 3009.60] P:1950.13 E:0.087863 |  Conor, thank you very much.
[3009.60 - 3012.60] P:1876.01 E:0.106006 |  Watching everything else in the Champions League this evening, it's John Bennett.
[3012.60 - 3016.60] P:1857.57 E:0.101173 |  So how is the highly anticipated Borussia Dortmund-Basalona game going then, John?
[3016.60 - 3020.60] P:1535.84 E:0.106558 |  Yes, another game that I talk up proves to be really boring.
[3020.60 - 3023.60] P:1738.59 E:0.098268 |  It sounds a bit like the Juventus against Man City game, actually.
[3023.60 - 3025.60] P:1712.00 E:0.109503 |  It's Borussia Dortmund-Neal, Barcelona-Neal.
[3025.60 - 3027.60] P:1608.01 E:0.092609 |  Barça are actually oppressing pretty well,
[3027.60 - 3030.60] P:1859.65 E:0.073882 |  but Dortmund defensively have been superb.
[3030.60 - 3034.60] P:1971.06 E:0.080752 |  Raphinha missed a good half-volley chance for Barcelona.
[3034.60 - 3036.60] P:1326.02 E:0.093831 |  Great pass by Lameña Málvide.
[3036.60 - 3038.60] P:1607.10 E:0.070738 |  It hasn't quite come to life yet that game.
[3038.60 - 3040.60] P:1678.07 E:0.093908 |  Elsewhere, there's a few Neal-Niels.
[3040.60 - 3043.60] P:1565.71 E:0.103118 |  Benfica, Neal, Bologna, Neal.
[3043.60 - 3046.60] P:1739.77 E:0.082958 |  Feyenoord having a brilliant first half against Sparta Prague.
[3046.60 - 3048.60] P:1358.42 E:0.080543 |  They've been up to 10 points as it stands.
[3048.60 - 3050.60] P:1815.70 E:0.070491 |  They're 3-1 up against Sparta Prague.
[3050.60 - 3055.60] P:1885.69 E:0.084120 |  The first time that Feyenoord have scored 3 in the first half of a Champions League game.
[3055.60 - 3059.60] P:1958.34 E:0.091523 |  There was a very emotional moment in the Stuttgart against Young Boys match.
[3059.60 - 3061.60] P:1772.92 E:0.102703 |  Stuttgart won Young Boys, won Young Boys,
[3061.60 - 3063.60] P:1997.19 E:0.079819 |  took the lead early, Lukash Lukomi,
[3063.60 - 3066.60] P:1837.31 E:0.090309 |  and he held up a shirt of his teammate, Mishak Elia.
[3066.60 - 3069.60] P:1938.20 E:0.085536 |  Elia's son sadly passed away this week,
[3069.60 - 3072.60] P:1765.53 E:0.088186 |  so a wonderful tribute by the players to their teammate.
[3072.60 - 3075.60] P:1749.12 E:0.101964 |  And finally, AC Milan won Red Star Belgrade Neal.
[3075.60 - 3076.60] P:1167.26 E:0.103821 |  A brilliant goal.
[3076.60 - 3079.60] P:1722.45 E:0.092638 |  This will be one of the highlights of the BBC Highlights show a bit later on.
[3079.60 - 3082.60] P:1661.17 E:0.091017 |  Rafael bringing the ball down edge of the box.
[3082.60 - 3085.60] P:1787.04 E:0.077580 |  The goalkeeper came out superb half-volley into the top corner.
[3085.60 - 3088.60] P:1363.83 E:0.086470 |  AC Milan won Red Star Belgrade Neal.
[3088.60 - 3090.60] P:1865.56 E:0.075138 |  Thank you very much for that, John.
[3090.60 - 3093.60] P:1852.63 E:0.098522 |  It's not exactly a goal-fest in the championship this evening either,
[3093.60 - 3097.60] P:1862.33 E:0.095684 |  but there is one at the game between Millwall and Sheffield United.
[3097.60 - 3100.60] P:1691.46 E:0.094837 |  They're leading by a goal to Neal.
[3100.60 - 3102.60] P:1727.48 E:0.097696 |  West Brom also taking on Coventry.
[3102.60 - 3104.60] P:1570.47 E:0.103972 |  Is Sani Rajavajalo there?
[3104.60 - 3105.60] P:1427.55 E:0.081230 |  Half-time Sani.
[3105.60 - 3107.60] P:1768.36 E:0.108168 |  Half-time West Brom won Coventry Neal.
[3107.60 - 3109.60] P:1941.68 E:0.097626 |  Alex Mohits' effort from the edge after 12.
[3109.60 - 3112.60] P:1887.45 E:0.087073 |  The difference took a big nick off the unfortunate Josh Eccles.
[3112.60 - 3114.60] P:1928.93 E:0.085984 |  Coventry's best chance had come with just three.
[3114.60 - 3118.60] P:1920.05 E:0.096281 |  Gone, Norman Bassett wriggling through the excellent Alex Palmer smothering.
[3118.60 - 3120.60] P:1828.55 E:0.094258 |  As the keeper did again, a minute from the break from Eccles.
[3120.60 - 3122.60] P:1819.85 E:0.095655 |  Frank Lampard hands in pockets.
[3122.60 - 3124.60] P:1990.29 E:0.090475 |  Alas, chill guy meme.
[3124.60 - 3126.60] P:1809.41 E:0.102751 |  He needs a little more heat from his Coventry side.
[3126.60 - 3128.60] P:1858.80 E:0.104070 |  Half-time West Brom, which I'll be one.
[3128.60 - 3129.60] P:1876.25 E:0.058090 |  Coventry City Neal.
[3129.60 - 3132.60] P:1793.53 E:0.096695 |  Chill guy, I think, excused in the current temperatures.
[3132.60 - 3135.60] P:1755.76 E:0.094493 |  Elsewhere, Hal City Neal, Watford Neal, QPR Neal, Oxford Neal.
[3135.60 - 3138.60] P:1862.03 E:0.090353 |  And it was goalless in the first half between Cardiff and Preston,
[3138.60 - 3140.60] P:1832.64 E:0.083303 |  but there's been an early goal in the second half,
[3140.60 - 3142.60] P:1488.41 E:0.097037 |  and it has gone Preston's way.
[3142.60 - 3145.60] P:1986.53 E:0.090939 |  In the Women's Champions League, it's Celtic Neal, Real Madrid won,
[3145.60 - 3147.60] P:2007.38 E:0.078537 |  and Chelsea three, Twente won.
[3147.60 - 3150.60] P:1897.32 E:0.102246 |  Nadia Maneuver is with us as well this evening,
[3150.60 - 3152.60] P:1843.38 E:0.088609 |  looking at Juventus against Manchester City,
[3152.60 - 3154.60] P:1452.43 E:0.085308 |  but of course part of the match of the day,
[3154.60 - 3157.60] P:1778.28 E:0.091461 |  highlights at 10.40 on BBC One later on this evening.
[3157.60 - 3159.60] P:1958.98 E:0.099593 |  As far as Juve and City are concerned,
[3159.60 - 3161.60] P:1845.59 E:0.087265 |  Nadia and Pat Nevan was saying,
[3161.60 - 3164.60] P:2053.28 E:0.098164 |  it feels like a game in which Nadia the team is prepared
[3164.60 - 3166.60] P:1895.58 E:0.088627 |  to take much of a risk,
[3166.60 - 3169.60] P:1716.51 E:0.097569 |  and it's not making for a massively entertaining first half.
[3169.60 - 3170.60] P:1734.21 E:0.073524 |  Yeah, I would agree.
[3170.60 - 3172.60] P:1346.19 E:0.080247 |  We're just in the room now, watching some of the highlights as it stands,
[3172.60 - 3174.60] P:1236.59 E:0.075213 |  and we're seeing diagonal balls being cut out.
[3174.60 - 3177.60] P:1533.66 E:0.085640 |  This is kind of what we've seen so far, unfortunately, in that first half,
[3177.60 - 3180.60] P:1544.27 E:0.068530 |  but I think for the way that Juventus have been playing,
[3180.60 - 3183.60] P:1587.89 E:0.066898 |  it's forced Manchester City to maybe be a bit more predictable.
[3183.60 - 3186.60] P:1342.31 E:0.075360 |  As Pat said, be a little bit safe passing it sideways,
[3186.60 - 3189.60] P:1747.80 E:0.074764 |  but Elling Holland himself is hugely isolated in the middle,
[3189.60 - 3191.60] P:1693.14 E:0.067019 |  facing two or three bodies around him.
[3191.60 - 3194.60] P:1534.42 E:0.074141 |  But I think if Juve are to try and win this game,
[3194.60 - 3196.60] P:1635.23 E:0.086200 |  I think at times they need to inject some speed with the likes of Yielders
[3196.60 - 3198.60] P:1534.26 E:0.066812 |  on the left wing, and can't stay set on the right,
[3198.60 - 3200.60] P:1521.48 E:0.073336 |  because I think that's when they've looked the most dangerous.
[3200.60 - 3202.60] P:1790.55 E:0.071189 |  And as for City, can you draw them out?
[3202.60 - 3204.60] P:1775.10 E:0.069366 |  Can you try and find a nice bit of play like we saw
[3204.60 - 3206.60] P:1313.12 E:0.089431 |  with just a few minutes left to go,
[3206.60 - 3209.60] P:1534.09 E:0.076169 |  when Elling Holland essentially had a 1v1 after Kevin Dubro and assist,
[3209.60 - 3211.60] P:1344.03 E:0.075300 |  but overall it does look like two teams
[3211.60 - 3213.60] P:1525.99 E:0.059232 |  that are probably lacking a bit of confidence,
[3213.60 - 3216.60] P:1565.05 E:0.074021 |  so I'm more scared to make a mistake than go out there and try and win the game.
[3216.60 - 3219.60] P:1654.11 E:0.098891 |  But you're right to point out that opportunity for Harlan,
[3219.60 - 3222.60] P:1863.79 E:0.095269 |  because that's the kind of shot that normally we'd put away.
[3222.60 - 3224.60] P:1648.88 E:0.100138 |  He didn't do too much wrong though, did he?
[3224.60 - 3228.60] P:1339.24 E:0.075813 |  No, he didn't. Listen, the way he takes one on one is nothing like what I used to do anyway.
[3228.60 - 3230.60] P:1694.98 E:0.093407 |  I'd probably kick that over the bar, and he's tried to chip it
[3230.60 - 3232.60] P:1222.72 E:0.077413 |  just over the goalkeeper and in fairness.
[3232.60 - 3234.60] P:1283.27 E:0.089682 |  I'd probably put it down to a good save,
[3234.60 - 3237.60] P:1664.60 E:0.069614 |  but for how good he is, and for the fact that he is one of the best in the world,
[3237.60 - 3239.60] P:1734.90 E:0.072979 |  you would expect him to score there.
[3239.60 - 3241.60] P:1633.37 E:0.069967 |  And I think it was nice to see from a City perspective
[3241.60 - 3243.60] P:1433.62 E:0.084053 |  that Elling Holland and Kevin Dubro, and again,
[3243.60 - 3245.60] P:1249.90 E:0.089446 |  it's something that we've not really seen that much of in recent months,
[3245.60 - 3249.60] P:1679.64 E:0.066280 |  but if they can get in the groove, then I'm sure they'll feel they've got an opportunity to win many games of football.
[3249.60 - 3253.60] P:1760.93 E:0.100887 |  Nadim, I know you've got a lot on as you prepare for that programme later on this evening,
[3253.60 - 3255.60] P:1974.18 E:0.088801 |  so thank you very much for joining us.
[3255.60 - 3259.60] P:1847.79 E:0.083234 |  It's Juventus Nyl, Manchester City Nyl at the moment,
[3259.60 - 3262.60] P:1842.74 E:0.087572 |  Arsenal leading Monaco by a goal to Nyl.
[3262.60 - 3265.60] P:1676.71 E:0.082765 |  We'll keep you across that. We've got a second half commentary of Juve against Manchester City,
[3265.60 - 3269.60] P:1903.37 E:0.079662 |  and we'll keep you across all the games that are happening in the Champions League this evening.
[3269.60 - 3273.60] P:1899.31 E:0.090347 |  We're going to check in now on the BBC News headlines with Jill McKenzie.
[3273.60 - 3275.60] P:1558.46 E:0.081723 |  The Voice of the UK.
[3275.60 - 3277.60] P:1536.49 E:0.117122 |  This is BBC Radio 5 Live.
[3277.60 - 3279.60] P:1474.96 E:0.095157 |  Thank you. Good evening.
[3279.60 - 3281.60] P:1741.94 E:0.090925 |  The Children's Commissioner for England has told 5 Live
[3281.60 - 3284.60] P:1744.48 E:0.103515 |  Sara Sharif's murder has to be a catalyst for change.
[3284.60 - 3289.60] P:2036.25 E:0.093429 |  Rachel DeSousa said the 10-year-old was failed by the safety net that should have been around her.
[3289.60 - 3293.60] P:1713.62 E:0.091984 |  Earlier, Sara's father and stepmother were found guilty of her murder.
[3293.60 - 3297.60] P:1721.06 E:0.091571 |  Irfan Sharif and Beynish Batul subjected Sara to years of violence.
[3297.60 - 3301.60] P:1708.80 E:0.079547 |  There'll be sentence next week alongside Sara's uncle Faisal Malik,
[3301.60 - 3305.60] P:1495.97 E:0.088560 |  who was found guilty of causing or allowing the death of a child.
[3305.60 - 3307.60] P:1801.99 E:0.076568 |  Rachel DeSousa spoke to us earlier.
[3307.60 - 3313.60] P:1957.01 E:0.068787 |  For years and years we've seen these deaths, and we get told lessons will be learned,
[3313.60 - 3315.60] P:1953.34 E:0.072038 |  you know, agencies will work together.
[3315.60 - 3317.60] P:1889.21 E:0.072693 |  I've had enough of that.
[3317.60 - 3320.60] P:2151.75 E:0.072138 |  I mean, Sara Sharif's death is so shocking.
[3320.60 - 3323.60] P:2058.93 E:0.081877 |  We need change. We need action. We need it now.
[3323.60 - 3326.60] P:1671.92 E:0.088541 |  Fighters in Syria have broken into the tomb of Hafez Al-Assad,
[3326.60 - 3330.60] P:1545.44 E:0.082567 |  the former president and father of the ousted Bashar al-Assad.
[3330.60 - 3335.60] P:1591.72 E:0.088226 |  Images show a coffin and parts of the mausoleum on fire in the family's hometown.
[3335.60 - 3339.60] P:1668.35 E:0.084057 |  Police investigating possible crimes linked to the post office scandal
[3339.60 - 3342.60] P:1718.48 E:0.078519 |  say they're looking at dozens of potential suspects.
[3342.60 - 3345.60] P:1482.73 E:0.091566 |  They include employees of the post office and Fujitsu,
[3345.60 - 3348.60] P:1660.11 E:0.090920 |  the company which made the faulty Horizon IT system,
[3348.60 - 3351.60] P:1679.73 E:0.084380 |  the led to sub-postmasters being accused of stealing.
[3351.60 - 3356.60] P:1782.63 E:0.090660 |  But police say any potential trials won't start until at least 2027,
[3356.60 - 3358.60] P:1506.44 E:0.077356 |  after the public enquiries finished.
[3358.60 - 3361.60] P:1897.19 E:0.076844 |  Commander Stephen Clayman is leading the operation.
[3361.60 - 3364.60] P:1477.64 E:0.111474 |  This allows us to take a significant move forward in terms of pace.
[3364.60 - 3367.60] P:1487.92 E:0.069460 |  And we are always tied to the public enquiry,
[3367.60 - 3370.60] P:1700.61 E:0.070065 |  but the scale of it is the sheer number of victims involved.
[3370.60 - 3376.60] P:1454.48 E:0.065832 |  We've got, you know, we think over 3,000 people affected in some way by Horizon in this manner.
[3376.60 - 3380.60] P:1752.58 E:0.082481 |  So it's huge. So we've got to put in the commensurate number of officers.
[3380.60 - 3384.60] P:1662.51 E:0.096092 |  LGBT veterans who were dismissed from the armed forces for being gay
[3384.60 - 3387.60] P:1477.51 E:0.093546 |  could get up to £70,000 in compensation.
[3387.60 - 3391.60] P:1675.58 E:0.082947 |  Some were convicted of sex offences while homosexuality was considered a crime.
[3391.60 - 3395.60] P:1750.31 E:0.077141 |  Applications for the government scheme will open on Friday.
[3395.60 - 3401.60] P:1772.49 E:0.086588 |  And the head of the FBI says he'll resign before President-elect Donald Trump takes office next month.
[3401.60 - 3405.60] P:1585.05 E:0.085932 |  Republicans have criticised Christopher Wray because of the FBI's investigations
[3405.60 - 3409.60] P:1718.93 E:0.078218 |  into Mr Trump after his previous stint in the White House.
[3409.60 - 3412.60] P:1802.26 E:0.095845 |  Count the goals the last-minute screams.
[3412.60 - 3415.60] P:1746.76 E:0.111206 |  From Cantoners flair to Aguero's dreams,
[3415.60 - 3418.60] P:1696.52 E:0.110609 |  the blue moon rises, the red flames burn.
[3418.60 - 3421.60] P:1321.41 E:0.103269 |  To the Etihad now, all eyes return.
[3421.60 - 3426.60] P:1491.38 E:0.115864 |  Feel the roar as the rivals meet with Bernardo's glides and Bruno's quick feet.
[3426.60 - 3429.60] P:1674.38 E:0.117085 |  From Garnaccio's precision to Harlan's stride,
[3429.60 - 3432.60] P:1602.43 E:0.113468 |  from the pitch to the stands the passion thrives.
[3432.60 - 3435.60] P:1521.41 E:0.114997 |  Through Derby days, through Glory's chase,
[3435.60 - 3438.60] P:1446.71 E:0.096387 |  cities charge in United's grace.
[3438.60 - 3443.60] P:1329.32 E:0.116961 |  The pride of Manchester never dies, as legends are made and foes collide.
[3443.60 - 3449.60] P:1572.26 E:0.105893 |  The Manchester Derby, Sunday from 4.30 on BBC Radio 5 Live.
[3450.60 - 3453.60] P:1614.00 E:0.140207 |  This is 5 Live Sports.
[3453.60 - 3456.60] P:1455.51 E:0.132394 |  The Champions League with Kelly Cates.
[3456.60 - 3458.60] P:1288.31 E:0.131308 |  Listen on BBC Sounds.
[3459.60 - 3463.60] P:1566.10 E:0.104214 |  We'll be back to Turin very shortly for the second half of Juventus against Manchester City.
[3463.60 - 3466.60] P:1834.82 E:0.096334 |  No goals as yet. Also in the Champions League,
[3466.60 - 3469.60] P:1670.17 E:0.098540 |  Arsenal lead Monaco by a goal to nil.
[3469.60 - 3471.60] P:1681.33 E:0.073845 |  We'll keep you up to date with everything that happens there.
[3471.60 - 3475.60] P:1805.22 E:0.098803 |  And of course we're across everything that's happening in the championship this evening,
[3475.60 - 3479.60] P:1734.74 E:0.099290 |  including at Millwall where they're taking on Sheffield United and Aaron Paul's watching.
[3479.60 - 3482.60] P:1780.47 E:0.104107 |  Ten minutes since the restart, Millwall-Nill, Sheffield United won the blades.
[3482.60 - 3485.60] P:1944.86 E:0.091877 |  Still leading for Rian Brewster's first half strike.
[3485.60 - 3489.60] P:1877.02 E:0.092366 |  His first goal, Kelly, in 27 months.
[3489.60 - 3492.60] P:1827.06 E:0.098461 |  It's a big goal for him. It's a big goal for Sheffield United.
[3492.60 - 3496.60] P:1827.60 E:0.081936 |  The win here takes them top of the championship tonight. Millwall-Nill, Sheffield United won.
[3496.60 - 3499.60] P:1622.68 E:0.104157 |  And QPR have gone one nil up against Oxford United.
[3499.60 - 3502.60] P:2041.06 E:0.081681 |  Sam Field has scored the goal for them.
[3502.60 - 3509.60] P:1843.50 E:0.090292 |  There'll be a special football daily out later this evening on the news that Saudi Arabia will host the 2034 World Cup.
[3509.60 - 3513.60] P:1835.75 E:0.089524 |  Wickham Wanderers player and the PFA's first sustainability champion, David Wheeler,
[3513.60 - 3520.60] P:1721.41 E:0.088183 |  has been talking about it, about the environmental impact both of Saudi host in the tournament and the World Cups before that.
[3520.60 - 3525.60] P:1796.14 E:0.083230 |  If we just rewind a little bit just to the 2026 World Cup where you're talking about
[3525.60 - 3531.60] P:1815.50 E:0.085278 |  spanning a whole continent in USA, Mexico, Canada, which in itself is insane.
[3531.60 - 3536.60] P:1732.06 E:0.087099 |  Moving on to, like you said, looking at three different continents,
[3536.60 - 3542.60] P:1686.46 E:0.077303 |  having to have that amount of flying, which is the other major climate impact.
[3542.60 - 3549.60] P:1863.59 E:0.088783 |  But also, all of these World Cups from here on out are going to have 40 more matches than they have done,
[3549.60 - 3553.60] P:1892.23 E:0.087528 |  which in itself is going to have a huge, huge carbon footprint.
[3553.60 - 3556.60] P:1653.61 E:0.077122 |  But also, look at the Saudi Arabia World Cup.
[3556.60 - 3563.60] P:1896.03 E:0.090314 |  They're one of the worst offenders in terms of trying to slow down the transition away from fossil fuels, international climate negotiations,
[3563.60 - 3568.60] P:1877.71 E:0.095863 |  and giving them a platform on the world stage like this is only going to make that situation worse
[3568.60 - 3574.60] P:1780.30 E:0.088599 |  when it's clear that government officials and people that represent us on the international stage
[3574.60 - 3580.60] P:1793.69 E:0.090872 |  are finding it difficult enough to agree on the simplest of things in transitioning away from fossil fuels.
[3580.60 - 3583.60] P:1767.67 E:0.070714 |  Would you want to hear players talking up about it more?
[3583.60 - 3592.60] P:1885.14 E:0.086654 |  Absolutely, yeah. I mean, we've seen from the letter of over 100 female players to FIFA to drop their sponsorship with Saudi around Coat
[3592.60 - 3598.60] P:1648.72 E:0.084922 |  that there are many female players that are willing to speak up.
[3598.60 - 3603.60] P:1742.75 E:0.081064 |  But there still, sadly, is a lack of male players prepared to do the same.
[3603.60 - 3608.60] P:1767.18 E:0.085838 |  But yeah, especially now with so much time until the Saudi World Cup,
[3608.60 - 3615.60] P:1671.22 E:0.082724 |  I really hope that there are professional players, top professional players that come out and say that this isn't a good idea.
[3615.60 - 3619.60] P:1897.77 E:0.095197 |  But I want to stress that it shouldn't really be down to the players as much as it would help.
[3619.60 - 3621.60] P:1885.50 E:0.088252 |  It should be down to the governing bodies.
[3621.60 - 3625.60] P:1953.17 E:0.090422 |  They shouldn't be sitting on their hands and taking this lightly.
[3625.60 - 3632.60] P:1817.59 E:0.091651 |  I'd look to the FA especially as a leader to say that, no, we're not going to take this line down.
[3632.60 - 3638.60] P:1674.37 E:0.086916 |  We're not accepting this. This is not in line with our values and there is time to find another host.
[3638.60 - 3641.60] P:1773.97 E:0.083173 |  That was David Wheeler talking about the environmental impact.
[3641.60 - 3647.60] P:1817.78 E:0.080289 |  The Saudi government says it's diversifying away from fossil fuels and trying to reduce emissions
[3647.60 - 3652.60] P:1842.14 E:0.080756 |  and has rejected criticism that it's using sport to distract from its record on sustainability.
[3653.60 - 3656.60] P:1918.02 E:0.074560 |  FIFA's World Cup evaluation report said,
[3656.60 - 3660.60] P:1739.97 E:0.091834 |  whilst the extent of construction would have a material environmental impact,
[3660.60 - 3666.60] P:1806.09 E:0.089837 |  the bid provides a good foundation for delivering mitigation measures to address some of the environment-related challenges.
[3666.60 - 3672.60] P:1890.58 E:0.071988 |  The FA said today, the FA board met the Saudi Arabian Football Federation last month.
[3672.60 - 3678.60] P:1756.70 E:0.085865 |  We asked them to commit to ensuring all fans would be safe and welcome in Saudi Arabia in 2034,
[3678.60 - 3681.60] P:2140.80 E:0.069787 |  including LGBTQ plus fans.
[3681.60 - 3687.60] P:1878.35 E:0.081285 |  They assured us that they are fully committed to providing a safe and welcome environment for all fans.
[3687.60 - 3692.60] P:1847.21 E:0.086605 |  There's a much more in-depth look at those issues and all the issues around the 2034 World Cup
[3692.60 - 3698.60] P:1823.04 E:0.079185 |  and indeed the 2030 World Cup on the podcast which is available later on BBC Sounds.
[3698.60 - 3700.60] P:2018.04 E:0.105581 |  The players are out in Turin.
[3700.60 - 3707.60] P:1804.90 E:0.097510 |  It's Juventus Nill, Manchester City Nill as we head into the second half in the company of Pat Nevin and John Murray.
[3707.60 - 3714.60] P:1724.47 E:0.090562 |  Thank you very much Kelly. It was a bit of a banana cake actually that was in the brown bag, which was very nice.
[3714.60 - 3716.60] P:1703.98 E:0.107342 |  There was much more than that, innit?
[3716.60 - 3718.60] P:1761.31 E:0.082727 |  Yeah, there was much more than that.
[3718.60 - 3722.60] P:1812.49 E:0.104562 |  There was a soup which I thought was asparagus and you thought was cauliflower.
[3722.60 - 3724.60] P:1811.37 E:0.106091 |  I think it meant we had mix of the two.
[3724.60 - 3731.60] P:1890.57 E:0.096801 |  There was another exciting little bag after I finished the soup which turned out to have croutons in it that I should have put in the soup.
[3731.60 - 3734.60] P:1869.87 E:0.105684 |  Vision John, vision I picked up with Nill very good.
[3734.60 - 3739.60] P:2072.90 E:0.095423 |  Teams are just taking their places. No changes at half time.
[3739.60 - 3745.60] P:2037.68 E:0.085952 |  You can still hear the sound of the Juventus Stadium. Unmistakable.
[3745.60 - 3749.60] P:1837.75 E:0.089954 |  Nill Nill as the second half begins with Juventus.
[3749.60 - 3757.60] P:1749.37 E:0.080346 |  De Gregorio in goal. Savona, Gatti, Kalulu and Danilo are the back four.
[3757.60 - 3759.60] P:1687.70 E:0.081596 |  Just trying to get my stopwatch started.
[3759.60 - 3762.60] P:1591.15 E:0.103464 |  I think it may be seized up in the Alpine cold.
[3762.60 - 3765.60] P:1713.24 E:0.089567 |  Danilo, the captain at left back.
[3765.60 - 3769.60] P:1687.29 E:0.092360 |  Locatelli in two around with Coupe miners in the midfield area.
[3769.60 - 3774.60] P:1578.23 E:0.087746 |  Konze Sau and Yildiz and the Flanks and Vlahavic through the middle.
[3774.60 - 3776.60] P:1856.07 E:0.098997 |  Manchester City as well as they started.
[3776.60 - 3778.60] P:1895.91 E:0.093194 |  The ball is currently with their goalkeeper.
[3778.60 - 3781.60] P:1704.95 E:0.087626 |  Edison, who's back in the side tonight, Ortega on the bench.
[3781.60 - 3791.60] P:1792.05 E:0.083007 |  The mainly three central defenders, Walker, Diaz and Gavardiol with Gundawan and Lewis in the middle of midfield.
[3791.60 - 3797.60] P:1844.27 E:0.096246 |  And then the line of four really, Bernardo Silva, De Bruyne, Grealish and Dooku and Harland through the middle.
[3797.60 - 3804.60] P:1753.14 E:0.089471 |  And the one big chance really, certainly for Manchester City, that Harland had was very well saved by De Gregorio.
[3804.60 - 3808.60] P:1676.21 E:0.100256 |  But normally you would see Harland took that away.
[3808.60 - 3812.60] P:1741.81 E:0.090730 |  He would do it. Keep on getting into those positions and he will put one of them away.
[3812.60 - 3820.60] P:1791.42 E:0.083204 |  But the one thing I would say to Man City fans, you may not have been terrible, but they are nowhere near the force they were.
[3820.60 - 3824.60] P:1764.52 E:0.082278 |  Just a number of months ago. It's not back yet.
[3824.60 - 3827.60] P:1765.78 E:0.085729 |  45 minutes with the controlled parts of the game.
[3827.60 - 3831.60] P:1586.98 E:0.091798 |  But it's a long way short of the Manchester City that was so dominant before.
[3831.60 - 3837.60] P:1867.34 E:0.104242 |  Very much so in the week that they play Manchester United in one of our five live Premier League commentaries this weekend.
[3837.60 - 3842.60] P:1835.57 E:0.090115 |  Juventus going down the right-hand side. Konze Sau wins the first corner of the second half.
[3842.60 - 3847.60] P:1795.75 E:0.095680 |  Arsenal winning 1-0 by the way, if you just switched on to us. Arsenal 1-0 up on Monaco.
[3847.60 - 3850.60] P:1879.39 E:0.086106 |  So Arsenal currently in fifth place in this table.
[3850.60 - 3859.60] P:1662.58 E:0.088802 |  But Juventus in Manchester City way down closer to the elimination zone than they are to the automatic places for the round of 16.
[3859.60 - 3863.60] P:1768.09 E:0.092147 |  Here's the Juventus corner into the edge of the six yard box headed away by Diaz.
[3863.60 - 3866.60] P:1707.48 E:0.094112 |  Comes out on that slice badly by Yildiz.
[3866.60 - 3873.60] P:1638.36 E:0.094267 |  Actually it's kept in, but the offside flag is up against Coop Miners, so it's a free kick to Manchester City.
[3873.60 - 3875.60] P:1773.80 E:0.096490 |  Second minute, nil nil Pat Nebbin.
[3875.60 - 3879.60] P:1438.06 E:0.095408 |  I can't believe I actually touched the ball there because Newham was going to be offside.
[3879.60 - 3883.60] P:1640.69 E:0.093747 |  Let it roll out for the throw-in, then you can press up.
[3883.60 - 3887.60] P:1676.52 E:0.088197 |  Actually touching it when you're 10 yards offside is just daft.
[3887.60 - 3893.60] P:1667.60 E:0.094135 |  It's nothing more than that. It was certainly a piece of play to do, but yeah, a little bit of a better start.
[3893.60 - 3896.60] P:1739.39 E:0.098340 |  Setting off there for Juventus, they're getting high up the pitch.
[3896.60 - 3901.60] P:1854.55 E:0.092250 |  To the right it's that the first half, you know, where Rico Lewis going in playing in that centre midfield position.
[3901.60 - 3906.60] P:1592.18 E:0.089088 |  Coming from left-back where he's defending, he's a very, very important player.
[3906.60 - 3908.60] P:1735.39 E:0.101544 |  He's really struggled to have an impact, hasn't he?
[3908.60 - 3911.60] P:1569.94 E:0.091607 |  Not much of an impact at all in this game.
[3911.60 - 3916.60] P:1583.59 E:0.098456 |  Again, underlining how difficult it is to play that position in control games.
[3916.60 - 3923.60] P:1531.47 E:0.105855 |  Yeah, Rico Lewis, who has been a big part of things for Manchester City this season.
[3923.60 - 3930.60] P:1523.29 E:0.102841 |  He's one of the players who's been able to stay fit, and he was picked out, wasn't he, by Pep Guardiola last night for his efforts.
[3930.60 - 3937.60] P:1528.65 E:0.097985 |  As Kalulu at the other end, the left-sided central defender plays it back to Di Gregorio with his blonde beard.
[3937.60 - 3942.60] P:1476.13 E:0.098377 |  The chip from him, but De Niro couldn't keep it in, so it's out of play for a throw-in to Manchester City.
[3942.60 - 3947.60] P:1471.14 E:0.095541 |  This time tomorrow you'll be listening to Rangers against Tottenham.
[3947.60 - 3948.60] P:1588.99 E:0.096099 |  Don't miss that tomorrow night.
[3948.60 - 3953.60] P:1673.75 E:0.095819 |  We'll have all of the British and Irish sides covered in the European competitions tomorrow evening.
[3953.60 - 3955.60] P:1482.90 E:0.094538 |  Chelsea on their way to Kazakhstan.
[3955.60 - 3957.60] P:1640.53 E:0.107693 |  Well, they should be there now, shouldn't they?
[3957.60 - 3961.60] P:1683.57 E:0.092281 |  Yes, as the ball is put out of play by Kalulu for a throw-in to City.
[3961.60 - 3963.60] P:1605.08 E:0.092278 |  Walker has come up to take it.
[3963.60 - 3972.60] P:1690.10 E:0.097430 |  And then on Friday, by the way, must mention the World Cup qualifying draw is going to be at 11 o'clock UK time.
[3972.60 - 3974.60] P:1611.80 E:0.093922 |  Live from Zurich, we'll have coverage.
[3974.60 - 3975.60] P:1723.19 E:0.101992 |  I'm off there tomorrow, actually.
[3975.60 - 3982.60] P:1669.21 E:0.096941 |  We'll have coverage in Five Live, and Adrian Childs' show, but you'll be able to listen to it on Five Live,
[3982.60 - 3986.60] P:1696.23 E:0.093889 |  and watch it on the iPlayer, and follow it via the BBC Sport app.
[3986.60 - 3990.60] P:1579.43 E:0.090638 |  So that's a World Cup qualifying draw Friday morning from 11 o'clock.
[3990.60 - 3996.60] P:1684.30 E:0.094658 |  As you know, Pat, I'm going on the train to Zurich, which I'm very much looking forward to, through the Alps.
[3996.60 - 3999.60] P:1509.01 E:0.105312 |  I've done that train before, and it's yet a clear day.
[3999.60 - 4002.60] P:1524.37 E:0.088763 |  It is one of the most beautiful journeys in the world.
[4002.60 - 4003.60] P:1644.61 E:0.110245 |  Well, that's what it is.
[4003.60 - 4007.60] P:1520.63 E:0.092838 |  Manchester City in possession with Bernardo Silva down below us.
[4007.60 - 4010.60] P:1835.99 E:0.101963 |  Here is the substitute's warm-up just off the pitch.
[4010.60 - 4011.60] P:1815.18 E:0.085900 |  That's nice.
[4011.60 - 4014.60] P:1735.52 E:0.094421 |  Gunderman with a shot that's blocked, and then Harlan with his back to go,
[4014.60 - 4016.60] P:1677.16 E:0.081286 |  stuck out a leg, couldn't bring it down.
[4016.60 - 4017.60] P:1708.92 E:0.083908 |  That was a chance for Gunderman.
[4017.60 - 4022.60] P:1649.61 E:0.099136 |  That's more like Kevin De Bruyne, I guess, in this wide area, and he zips the pass in this team.
[4022.60 - 4027.60] P:1551.59 E:0.096578 |  Not let him go in, he might go, zips it in, and Gunderman, he tries to get it on to...
[4027.60 - 4029.60] P:1611.49 E:0.089797 |  Well, tries to get a shot on.
[4029.60 - 4033.60] P:1642.29 E:0.098018 |  Comes to Harlan there, but there's no way he's going to get a shot away from there.
[4033.60 - 4037.60] P:1629.78 E:0.101175 |  The ball's behind him, and the chance just dribbled away, but it's much, much better
[4037.60 - 4042.60] P:1509.82 E:0.093095 |  than Kevin De Bruyne can play those passes quicker with more authority.
[4042.60 - 4046.60] P:1741.04 E:0.098369 |  Manchester City in the Maroon kit, attacking towards the end where all the noise is coming from
[4046.60 - 4050.60] P:1662.77 E:0.088434 |  that you can hear from the Juventus fans with their many and varied flags.
[4050.60 - 4053.60] P:1590.15 E:0.091185 |  Dooku back to Grealish.
[4053.60 - 4055.60] P:1657.37 E:0.089259 |  Grealish brings it in field.
[4055.60 - 4060.60] P:1621.77 E:0.098759 |  Jack Grealish just his ninth start of the season, had a couple of spells out.
[4060.60 - 4064.60] P:1638.02 E:0.096619 |  Now Walker, Kyle Walker then rolls it here to Bernardo Silva.
[4064.60 - 4068.60] P:1740.70 E:0.096967 |  Early ball in, it's dummied on the edge of the box, but I think it might have flicked the heel of Gunderman,
[4068.60 - 4074.60] P:1692.25 E:0.095077 |  and that meant the Juventus in the black and white stripes, broad black and white stripes on the front of their shirts this season.
[4074.60 - 4080.60] P:1788.14 E:0.099240 |  We're able to play it at the Vlajvic, it was challenged by Dias, goes to Ground and it's a free kick to the home side,
[4080.60 - 4082.60] P:1613.60 E:0.104166 |  just to the left of the central circle.
[4082.60 - 4089.60] P:1568.28 E:0.093713 |  Chelsea's women now 5-1 up on 20 in the Champions League, so 5-1 to Chelsea,
[4089.60 - 4095.60] P:1413.21 E:0.092805 |  and it's still Celtic Nyl Real Madrid 1 in that group.
[4095.60 - 4104.60] P:1606.24 E:0.093948 |  Gatti at the back, Federico Gatti who rolls up from the lower reaches.
[4104.60 - 4109.60] P:1747.97 E:0.093987 |  He was playing in the fourth tier of Italian football and got this dream move to the event,
[4109.60 - 4116.60] P:1687.93 E:0.100571 |  and now he's in the Champions League, a very rugged central defender,
[4116.60 - 4120.60] P:1744.13 E:0.091927 |  very much in the mould of his hero, Kialini.
[4120.60 - 4125.60] P:1729.95 E:0.099427 |  That's a poor ball, but he's been fortunate there, did reach Kutminers.
[4125.60 - 4133.60] P:1693.40 E:0.091148 |  Gatti couldn't intercept it, and now Savona, but Conce Sáocum short and Juventus have gone back into their own half.
[4133.60 - 4138.60] P:1758.70 E:0.098783 |  There was another opportunity, that ball we're talking about was City playing very, very high line,
[4138.60 - 4143.60] P:1605.66 E:0.089467 |  they were only 10 yards inside their own half there, but the ball was played over the top.
[4143.60 - 4149.60] P:1693.08 E:0.100358 |  It just didn't have anyone, Juventus, in the midfield, you could look up and see that pass there,
[4149.60 - 4153.60] P:1727.40 E:0.099673 |  but Kutminers, that's probably the third time he's actually run and beat the offside trap,
[4153.60 - 4156.60] P:1616.49 E:0.091535 |  and the ball has just not been delivered.
[4156.60 - 4163.60] P:1516.09 E:0.098817 |  So it remains nil-nil, Juventus potentially involved in yet another draw,
[4163.60 - 4167.60] P:1534.65 E:0.096156 |  having drawn seven of their last nine in all competitions.
[4167.60 - 4172.60] P:1437.50 E:0.096116 |  Turan, up to Vláovic, stuck out of foot, couldn't control it.
[4172.60 - 4177.60] P:1323.40 E:0.096941 |  Gavardioli was able to play it forward to Grealish, he's gone tumbling down off the ball,
[4177.60 - 4183.60] P:1587.70 E:0.101518 |  might have just been brushed by Yildiz, and then Kevin de Bruner through the middle,
[4183.60 - 4187.60] P:1749.19 E:0.108814 |  Gatti comes out strongly, wins the ball against de Bruner,
[4187.60 - 4193.60] P:1627.65 E:0.097459 |  and Big Gatti has taken it downfield and has now played it out to Konceysau on the right wing.
[4193.60 - 4198.60] P:1527.81 E:0.091654 |  Konceysau against Lewis still going, twisting and turning inside the box,
[4198.60 - 4203.60] P:1553.22 E:0.095453 |  Gavardioli is there as well, Konceysau then gives it back to Savonar,
[4203.60 - 4206.60] P:1553.08 E:0.112775 |  and then all the way back for the ball to be played in.
[4206.60 - 4211.60] P:1756.90 E:0.109968 |  A spectacular shot by Gatti near the penalty spot that was saved by Edison,
[4211.60 - 4216.60] P:1667.27 E:0.110592 |  and it comes again, and it's headed in, I think that's it, is it over the line?
[4216.60 - 4224.60] P:1778.40 E:0.115897 |  It is, it's given, the header forced in by Vláovic, Edison on the line,
[4224.60 - 4230.60] P:1649.46 E:0.114465 |  made a scrambling save, but it was over the line, and Juventus are in front.
[4230.60 - 4236.60] P:1778.59 E:0.114281 |  This is trouble for Manchester City, and the Champions League here in Turan.
[4237.60 - 4243.60] P:1878.16 E:0.121706 |  Manchester City is now there complaining, they feel as if it was,
[4243.60 - 4247.60] P:1974.47 E:0.116938 |  it was claiming like the back post there, they were really good playing the right hand side there,
[4247.60 - 4251.60] P:1967.99 E:0.106176 |  really livened up, down the right hand side by Konceysau,
[4251.60 - 4256.60] P:2039.10 E:0.112356 |  he goes and takes on two men, drags Flairs away, and gets the ball in the back post,
[4256.60 - 4261.60] P:2034.93 E:0.103116 |  this Sander's ball he kicked from Gatti, which fantastic, what else was he doing up there?
[4261.60 - 4266.60] P:1888.75 E:0.097352 |  He just kept it to the, he stayed on off, the ball went, it was put in again,
[4266.60 - 4273.60] P:1721.18 E:0.100349 |  I'm amazed you're nice, I brought you a spot for you, I didn't think it was over the line from Vláovic, but it was.
[4273.60 - 4279.60] P:1711.46 E:0.108315 |  Yeah, next to the post, Edison sort of parried it, it bounced down,
[4279.60 - 4286.60] P:1739.23 E:0.106357 |  and as he tried to claw it away, it did, well the technicals have confirmed it,
[4286.60 - 4291.60] P:1785.33 E:0.099467 |  no line technology, by the time he clawed it away, it had just bounced over the line.
[4291.60 - 4296.60] P:1672.34 E:0.092597 |  Yeah, hey, it's mellowed me over the line, but that's what we've got the technology for,
[4296.60 - 4300.60] P:1848.42 E:0.092925 |  to work it, the referee's going to have a look, and there's that claimant at the back post,
[4300.60 - 4305.60] P:1851.87 E:0.094067 |  I don't think he's going to give it at all, Vláovic today, I have to say I'm very, very impressed with him,
[4305.60 - 4310.60] P:1883.72 E:0.088853 |  he has chased and harried all the way, and the goal is given.
[4310.60 - 4315.60] P:1910.77 E:0.092239 |  Yeah, goal is confirmed, there was no foul involved in that, which I think is the right decision,
[4315.60 - 4320.60] P:1835.38 E:0.085750 |  I must say, when he's seen it once again, but it came initially, as I mentioned,
[4320.60 - 4324.60] P:1891.04 E:0.093190 |  Gatti had taken the ball forward from central defence, then ended up in a position,
[4324.60 - 4328.60] P:1943.98 E:0.094303 |  like the centre forward, and it was his volley that forced the initial save from Edison,
[4328.60 - 4332.60] P:1717.68 E:0.099022 |  but then Yildiz was onto it, and his cross ultimately headed for the goal.
[4332.60 - 4337.60] P:1750.21 E:0.098343 |  We were talking earlier on about risk taking, no one was taking risks,
[4337.60 - 4341.60] P:1723.55 E:0.103697 |  that's the biggest risk of the game so far, Gatti plays it out from centre half,
[4341.60 - 4345.60] P:1746.78 E:0.100665 |  and instead of stopping, he just gets his heels pinned back and goes,
[4345.60 - 4350.60] P:1733.74 E:0.101805 |  and he goes all the way up, and gets to the 18 yard line, but then stays there,
[4350.60 - 4354.60] P:1727.79 E:0.083483 |  he doesn't think, oh it's not coming right away, he stays when the ball came in,
[4354.60 - 4358.60] P:1669.10 E:0.089165 |  what a brilliant effort, the scissors kept that, and what a dream,
[4358.60 - 4362.60] P:1827.97 E:0.103734 |  actually what a fairytale that would have been, had he scored the goal.
[4362.60 - 4366.60] P:1693.31 E:0.092389 |  Yeah, and what about Edison, was the more he could have done with that,
[4366.60 - 4370.60] P:1817.38 E:0.101927 |  I mean the header was from relatively close range, did parry it initially,
[4370.60 - 4377.60] P:1805.11 E:0.094231 |  as Manchester City, who have now dropped down to 22nd in the Champions League table,
[4377.60 - 4384.60] P:1831.91 E:0.088334 |  with this scoreline losing 1-0 here, they are just, well they're just three places
[4384.60 - 4386.60] P:1722.77 E:0.096825 |  above the elimination places.
[4386.60 - 4389.60] P:1706.85 E:0.096334 |  The points, that's the thing, the points Charlie, it's not enough points,
[4389.60 - 4390.60] P:1601.46 E:0.105514 |  they need more points.
[4390.60 - 4396.60] P:1823.72 E:0.103107 |  And even if they win their final two matches, then you would think that would not be enough
[4396.60 - 4400.60] P:1676.33 E:0.090172 |  to get them into the top eight, and it might get worse here,
[4400.60 - 4405.60] P:1908.33 E:0.101690 |  as Juventus Lavich, the goal scorer, having just scored his 10th goal of the season,
[4405.60 - 4409.60] P:1703.51 E:0.080535 |  plays it for Konce Sáu, Konce Sáu, then to the left hand side,
[4409.60 - 4414.60] P:1845.52 E:0.091786 |  Vljavíc, deep cross, that's dangerous, but it's headed by the right back Savona,
[4414.60 - 4416.60] P:1859.79 E:0.092269 |  well wide of goal.
[4416.60 - 4421.60] P:1765.06 E:0.100952 |  QPR are now two nil up on Oxford, Sam Field, I think scored the first goal,
[4421.60 - 4428.60] P:1694.62 E:0.094364 |  yes he did, so that is two goals for QPR, two goals for Sam Field in the Champions League,
[4428.60 - 4434.60] P:1647.64 E:0.093030 |  Barcelona have taken the lead through Rafinha, so Dortmund nil, Barcelona one,
[4434.60 - 4443.60] P:1684.57 E:0.088605 |  and VfB Stuttgart now 2-1 ahead against young boys, the Swiss side did lead in that match,
[4443.60 - 4450.60] P:1565.50 E:0.104798 |  and that means that Barcelona are now in second place in the live table.
[4450.60 - 4454.60] P:1594.83 E:0.100720 |  Manchester City, De Bruyne up on Arta Silva, now to Grealish in the D,
[4454.60 - 4457.60] P:1687.08 E:0.096877 |  Manchester City having to come from behind here in Turin,
[4457.60 - 4461.60] P:1936.30 E:0.100370 |  Dooku in the area on the left hand side, excellent footplay, Dooku shot,
[4461.60 - 4464.60] P:1875.08 E:0.102006 |  that's blocked, Lewis now with a chance, that's blocked as well by Kupmeiners,
[4464.60 - 4468.60] P:1741.98 E:0.094206 |  who threw himself in front of it, and Manchester City have dealt that game,
[4468.60 - 4471.60] P:1880.96 E:0.098854 |  but that's what they're doing as Walker goes round the outside,
[4471.60 - 4476.60] P:1774.42 E:0.097224 |  Walker, his ball in field pass to Nilo, and Juventus will pass it away from the back.
[4476.60 - 4481.60] P:1713.81 E:0.090581 |  In fact, they don't, Gundoans won it back from Kallulu,
[4481.60 - 4485.60] P:1727.30 E:0.091122 |  and Manchester City will come again, Walker in field to De Bruyne,
[4485.60 - 4488.60] P:1788.48 E:0.092077 |  De Bruyne has passed straight into the legs of the defender,
[4488.60 - 4491.60] P:1737.74 E:0.099886 |  now Vlávic and Juventus might be away on the counter attack here,
[4491.60 - 4495.60] P:1756.38 E:0.103614 |  and Vlávic goes for the pass to Konce Sao, and he brings it down,
[4495.60 - 4499.60] P:1810.01 E:0.102516 |  but he took him wide, however the chance is still possibly here for Juventus,
[4499.60 - 4502.60] P:1761.87 E:0.108216 |  Konce Sao brings it back into the area and shoots into the legs of Guardiol,
[4502.60 - 4505.60] P:1778.35 E:0.100131 |  and it bounces away to Grealish near the halfway line.
[4505.60 - 4509.60] P:1794.67 E:0.105641 |  I can't believe Konce Sao didn't take Guardiol on there, he just ran up,
[4509.60 - 4513.60] P:1882.28 E:0.116171 |  Guardiol is backing away, backing away, backing away, keep on going,
[4513.60 - 4517.60] P:1876.10 E:0.105833 |  don't need to shoot for that angle there, you had him on source,
[4517.60 - 4522.60] P:1865.22 E:0.095963 |  don't know why he didn't do it, however, since the goal, the pace has been picked up from Manchester City,
[4522.60 - 4526.60] P:1743.78 E:0.086423 |  the pace that they should play it, they have to play it if they're going to be successful,
[4526.60 - 4531.60] P:1576.24 E:0.095385 |  and right now talking about pace and lightning, sort of, quickness in the final third,
[4531.60 - 4535.60] P:1582.63 E:0.109646 |  I think Phil Forden's needed here, and I think he's coming on, what is he?
[4535.60 - 4541.60] P:1742.87 E:0.104326 |  Is he warming up? So it's 1-0 to Juventus, Dusan Vlávic's goal,
[4541.60 - 4546.60] P:1867.19 E:0.092342 |  that Edison wasn't able to keep out, but Gundogan now through the middle,
[4546.60 - 4551.60] P:1772.27 E:0.091932 |  slips it to his left to Grealish, Grealish into the D, now to the right,
[4551.60 - 4555.60] P:1793.83 E:0.110619 |  and Bernardo Silva with the shot, straight into Danilo, his former teammate,
[4555.60 - 4558.60] P:1594.81 E:0.101289 |  and it depletes wide for a corner to the visitors.
[4558.60 - 4561.60] P:1632.08 E:0.098371 |  I know it's only a couple of minutes, but since they lost the goal,
[4561.60 - 4566.60] P:1532.07 E:0.110003 |  Manchester have been absolutely fantastic, back to Manchester City, playing at that tempo,
[4566.60 - 4569.60] P:1541.30 E:0.116638 |  but everybody wanting the ball, everyone zipping the ball about,
[4569.60 - 4574.60] P:1677.72 E:0.105262 |  imagine it to passes, taking risks with those chances in these passes as well.
[4574.60 - 4577.60] P:1509.20 E:0.114382 |  You want to see them do that all day, the only thing they've done it in the game,
[4577.60 - 4579.60] P:1718.51 E:0.100158 |  is since they lost that goal.
[4579.60 - 4584.60] P:1596.03 E:0.106585 |  Yeah, as you can hear, the sound's been turned up by the Juventus supporters,
[4584.60 - 4591.60] P:1653.05 E:0.073499 |  corner easily here to where by Coopminers, and then Flicks from Gundogan and De Bruyne,
[4591.60 - 4598.60] P:1759.42 E:0.085096 |  but one back by Yildiz, who turns it into his own penalty area,
[4598.60 - 4604.60] P:1700.83 E:0.095080 |  where Kalulu will volley it downfield, but Manchester City are coming on more strongly here,
[4604.60 - 4608.60] P:1710.98 E:0.100619 |  they've raised their game since going behind in the 54th minute,
[4608.60 - 4613.60] P:1522.39 E:0.096790 |  we're all going to go back to Arsenal in a moment, but Manchester City are threatening here,
[4613.60 - 4620.60] P:1504.35 E:0.099726 |  De Bruyne, Arsenal are winning 1-0, Manchester City losing 1-0, the 2023 Champions,
[4620.60 - 4624.60] P:1672.51 E:0.101228 |  Manchester City, who've been in two of the last four Champions League finals,
[4624.60 - 4630.60] P:1497.72 E:0.098531 |  but with this scoreline, are in some danger in this new Champions League.
[4630.60 - 4635.60] P:1451.77 E:0.099164 |  Here's Gundogan, as Manchester City are parked in the Juventus Har,
[4635.60 - 4638.60] P:1590.58 E:0.103964 |  his ball forward to Dockers, on the right now, Dockers ball across,
[4638.60 - 4642.60] P:1710.09 E:0.096618 |  and then he's cleared away out of play by Gattie for a throw in,
[4642.60 - 4646.60] P:1638.89 E:0.098426 |  and in fact the offside flag was up, and that will give us the opportunity to get an update
[4646.60 - 4649.60] P:1536.89 E:0.105422 |  from Conor McNamara, who's at the Emirates Stadium.
[4649.60 - 4653.60] P:1731.39 E:0.111606 |  You join us at a choice moment, because Arsenal have just got their first corner of the game,
[4653.60 - 4657.60] P:1736.21 E:0.110765 |  this is where the entrance fee is, Arsenal lead by Bukai Osaka's Golden Hill,
[4657.60 - 4661.60] P:1652.22 E:0.107398 |  Monaco who have improved since the break, they brought on to Kuni Minimino,
[4661.60 - 4664.60] P:1745.41 E:0.111083 |  the former Liverpool player, he's already had a shot off target,
[4664.60 - 4666.60] P:1591.38 E:0.109948 |  Arsenal's got a lot of good football choreography here,
[4666.60 - 4670.60] P:1700.92 E:0.097325 |  Arsenal players at the back post, referee is having to sort it all out,
[4670.60 - 4673.60] P:1562.74 E:0.109385 |  Declan Rice getting ready to take the quarter kick,
[4673.60 - 4676.60] P:1814.34 E:0.106677 |  you've probably heard John that Nicholas Yover, the set-piece coach,
[4676.60 - 4679.60] P:1830.92 E:0.111475 |  has been given his own mural outside the stadium by Arsenal fans,
[4679.60 - 4682.60] P:1764.50 E:0.109778 |  so in Aberdeen they buy his routines for these quarter kicks,
[4682.60 - 4686.60] P:1771.17 E:0.101094 |  so here it comes after the big build-up, Declan Rice from the left-hand side,
[4686.60 - 4689.60] P:1547.39 E:0.108352 |  towards the back post, and wouldn't you know it's pushed away by the goalkeeper,
[4689.60 - 4691.60] P:1603.50 E:0.088180 |  Arsenal won, Monaco nil.
[4691.60 - 4695.60] P:1745.70 E:0.094909 |  So 1-0 to Arsenal, Manchester City still 1-0 down,
[4695.60 - 4698.60] P:1623.46 E:0.103100 |  and Juventus just causing a problem with the ball into the penalty area
[4698.60 - 4702.60] P:1687.90 E:0.105889 |  that was parried by Edison, and the ball very nearly fell to Juventus.
[4702.60 - 4705.60] P:1645.44 E:0.105216 |  Well, parried's been chained about it, but Jovibe better than that,
[4705.60 - 4708.60] P:1683.73 E:0.093169 |  I wouldn't blame him for the goal, however,
[4708.60 - 4710.60] P:1721.08 E:0.091899 |  I think a number of people possibly would.
[4710.60 - 4715.60] P:1857.76 E:0.107279 |  Goku now near the edge of the box, that he was not fouled by Locatelli,
[4715.60 - 4719.60] P:1902.75 E:0.102422 |  thought he had a case there, but referee Dupan says no,
[4719.60 - 4724.60] P:1771.11 E:0.093707 |  and so it's brought away by Juventus in the Champions League.
[4724.60 - 4727.60] P:1759.72 E:0.115425 |  Everyone can see this, that thrown through the middle,
[4727.60 - 4731.60] P:1605.00 E:0.098313 |  I mentioned a few minutes ago, Cook Miners keeps on making this kind of
[4731.60 - 4735.60] P:1664.60 E:0.102270 |  inside-forward move to a high line, and the whole place shouts,
[4735.60 - 4739.60] P:1498.42 E:0.095414 |  play it, he's now done it three times, and he's not being played in,
[4739.60 - 4742.60] P:1612.23 E:0.100508 |  Manchester City cannot allow that to keep on happening,
[4742.60 - 4745.60] P:1445.68 E:0.104432 |  or else Cook Miners will get through one of the goals.
[4745.60 - 4750.60] P:1668.79 E:0.091896 |  Thank you. Later scores in the five matches in the championship tonight.
[4750.60 - 4754.60] P:1802.65 E:0.102878 |  Cardiff Nill, Preston One, to Pulsity Nill, Watford Nill,
[4754.60 - 4758.60] P:1802.76 E:0.096708 |  three-kick Juventus in the centre-circle, Milwarn Nill, Sheffield United,
[4758.60 - 4764.60] P:1642.55 E:0.088699 |  one, QPR, two-nil up against Oxford, and West Brom won, Coventry Nill.
[4764.60 - 4766.60] P:1606.08 E:0.100201 |  Of course, Juventus have got nothing on West Brom
[4766.60 - 4768.60] P:1699.08 E:0.093946 |  in terms of being draw specialist,
[4768.60 - 4771.60] P:1606.80 E:0.093518 |  West Brom who've drawn ten of their last eleven.
[4772.60 - 4777.60] P:1426.96 E:0.093693 |  And even with this, just a very good point.
[4777.60 - 4783.60] P:1647.46 E:0.096071 |  Here is Turan, who goes back to the edge of the penalty area,
[4783.60 - 4788.60] P:1565.97 E:0.098118 |  and just give your microphone a bit of attention, Pat, for a moment or two.
[4788.60 - 4792.60] P:1617.71 E:0.091651 |  Yeah, as D Grigorial, long and forward from him,
[4792.60 - 4794.60] P:1835.66 E:0.093182 |  might have struck the arm of Vlavic, Diaz is with him,
[4794.60 - 4800.60] P:1800.88 E:0.100317 |  but Gavadio comes across, Juventus are claiming that Diaz manhandled Vlavic,
[4800.60 - 4803.60] P:1703.38 E:0.096415 |  but I felt he hand-balled it in the initial stage.
[4803.60 - 4808.60] P:1719.70 E:0.080807 |  Manchester City have got it back, and are attacking again, De Bruyne to Docku,
[4808.60 - 4812.60] P:1698.14 E:0.097246 |  then back to De Bruyne, and to Docku in the area, could open up here,
[4812.60 - 4814.60] P:1708.23 E:0.099822 |  but the ball all agree across the six-yard box,
[4814.60 - 4819.60] P:1758.74 E:0.102725 |  eventually rolls out for a throw-in next to the corner flag.
[4822.60 - 4825.60] P:1663.10 E:0.101717 |  We'll just get that sorted, Pat.
[4825.60 - 4827.60] P:1470.62 E:0.122077 |  I think we've got it sorted.
[4827.60 - 4829.60] P:1321.04 E:0.093879 |  Exactly.
[4829.60 - 4832.60] P:1399.50 E:0.097789 |  Now, Bruyne for me, it wasn't between Kevin De Bruyne and Docku,
[4832.60 - 4836.60] P:1525.66 E:0.098353 |  it puts the ball across between the centre-backs of the goalkeeper.
[4836.60 - 4839.60] P:1508.72 E:0.108467 |  Of course, you're expecting that manhandling to be there,
[4839.60 - 4843.60] P:1439.29 E:0.092115 |  but he just went to the penalty spot expecting the cut-back.
[4843.60 - 4845.60] P:1542.23 E:0.101063 |  You have to take a chance at this, Reica.
[4845.60 - 4849.60] P:1360.67 E:0.092888 |  You took the chance that it would be cut-back, and it wasn't.
[4849.60 - 4851.60] P:1511.72 E:0.103898 |  Much better.
[4851.60 - 4853.60] P:1755.96 E:0.111350 |  Dortmund have equalised against Barcelona.
[4853.60 - 4859.60] P:1471.62 E:0.097533 |  Seru Girasi has made it Dortmund 1, Barcelona 1,
[4859.60 - 4864.60] P:1491.15 E:0.093277 |  and VSB Stuttgart now 3-1 up on Young Boys.
[4864.60 - 4866.60] P:1206.62 E:0.087974 |  And it's a corner.
[4866.60 - 4868.60] P:1594.87 E:0.084832 |  It's actually a good for a corner.
[4868.60 - 4870.60] P:1650.63 E:0.082981 |  Yes, it did.
[4871.60 - 4873.60] P:1817.13 E:0.118447 |  The corner went out for a throw-in.
[4873.60 - 4877.60] P:1891.31 E:0.100767 |  Manchester City have taken the corner, they took it short to Bruyne.
[4877.60 - 4882.60] P:2042.59 E:0.107511 |  To Bruyne, turns, and then passes it straight into the corner.
[4883.60 - 4888.60] P:1779.91 E:0.105086 |  And Juventus can counterattack, but consists of a waste of the pass.
[4888.60 - 4892.60] P:1840.24 E:0.090860 |  Manchester City might have a chance here with Juventus having committed men downfield.
[4892.60 - 4895.60] P:1879.41 E:0.097428 |  Greenish then, Greenish running at Kalulu, then getting it square to De Bruyne.
[4895.60 - 4899.60] P:1862.50 E:0.094525 |  De Bruyne now to Docku, Docku then across, hits the defender, bounces down.
[4899.60 - 4903.60] P:1783.52 E:0.090904 |  Bernardo Silva back to De Bruyne, still in the area, puts one foot on it.
[4903.60 - 4906.60] P:1771.50 E:0.107545 |  Then the shot from Gundawan, and it comes out with Walker.
[4906.60 - 4911.60] P:1740.00 E:0.102314 |  And he's blocked away by Danilo to the halfway line.
[4911.60 - 4914.60] P:1721.27 E:0.096791 |  But you know Manchester City have got this in them.
[4914.60 - 4917.60] P:1644.79 E:0.089296 |  If they can do it since they go home, since losing a goal,
[4917.60 - 4920.60] P:1675.19 E:0.089165 |  they're utterly dominated to play.
[4920.60 - 4924.60] P:1820.33 E:0.087494 |  They're up in the final third, everybody's running at a much, much quicker pace.
[4924.60 - 4928.60] P:1910.80 E:0.095569 |  They're looking to get beyond their defender's timing again.
[4928.60 - 4932.60] P:1799.28 E:0.081721 |  It's Manchester City of old, but you've got to do that much more often
[4932.60 - 4935.60] P:1920.67 E:0.098678 |  than just as soon as you go 1-0 down.
[4935.60 - 4937.60] P:1869.12 E:0.087773 |  Fianna Auto scored three goals against Manchester City,
[4937.60 - 4940.60] P:1835.77 E:0.099684 |  and their last match have scored four goals tonight
[4940.60 - 4944.60] P:1745.89 E:0.079157 |  against struggling Sparta Prague, so that is 4-1.
[4944.60 - 4947.60] P:1693.77 E:0.099958 |  Let's go back to Millwall and Aaron Paul.
[4947.60 - 4950.60] P:1634.36 E:0.109641 |  10 minutes to go here, Millwall-Nil Sheffield united one,
[4950.60 - 4953.60] P:1775.71 E:0.104064 |  Rian Brewster's goal, the only goal of the game.
[4953.60 - 4956.60] P:1671.60 E:0.103720 |  Both sides have had opportunities, the best from Mihail Ervanovich,
[4956.60 - 4959.60] P:1545.30 E:0.106724 |  played in on the left-hand side by Kastar D'Norra,
[4959.60 - 4962.60] P:1733.48 E:0.106037 |  and Vanovic-Nacerbian just smashing the ball over the bar.
[4962.60 - 4964.60] P:1486.55 E:0.100004 |  Millwall-Nil Sheffield united one.
[4964.60 - 4967.60] P:1643.58 E:0.094612 |  And Sani Radhra Vajala has the latest from the Hawthorns.
[4967.60 - 4970.60] P:1587.95 E:0.099948 |  65 gone, West Bromwant Coventry nailed.
[4970.60 - 4972.60] P:1549.28 E:0.105341 |  Norman Bassett with a flying header for Coventry,
[4972.60 - 4976.60] P:1721.58 E:0.100912 |  five yards out, unmarked, heading wide just a moment ago.
[4976.60 - 4978.60] P:1690.75 E:0.097421 |  Big chance for Coventry, West Brom still lead.
[4978.60 - 4980.60] P:1562.53 E:0.086936 |  West Bromwant, Coventry City nil.
[4980.60 - 4982.60] P:1511.91 E:0.104630 |  Don't get many Normans now, do you?
[4982.60 - 4985.60] P:1896.76 E:0.100696 |  De Bruyne, 25 yards out, hits the shot, but it bounces well wide,
[4985.60 - 4989.60] P:1931.50 E:0.092574 |  just runs his fingers through his hair, goal kick, 1-0, your Ventus lead.
[4989.60 - 4993.60] P:1559.44 E:0.085967 |  Absolutely. By the way, with names, they get very unhacked through a wealth.
[4993.60 - 4997.60] P:1710.59 E:0.083906 |  And then when they come very, very, very unhacked, they're suddenly happy again.
[4997.60 - 5000.60] P:1817.51 E:0.075770 |  Well, look out for Normans.
[5000.60 - 5003.60] P:1626.05 E:0.084078 |  Well, look out for Johns, maybe.
[5003.60 - 5005.60] P:1742.16 E:0.104573 |  I'm sorry, you're buying them here.
[5005.60 - 5009.60] P:1696.19 E:0.079579 |  You don't get many baby Johns these days.
[5009.60 - 5012.60] P:1655.28 E:0.080267 |  20 minutes played in the second half,
[5012.60 - 5019.60] P:1522.94 E:0.090946 |  and Manchester City have to pull something out here.
[5019.60 - 5022.60] P:1536.45 E:0.097109 |  And they're facing the possibility, Manchester City,
[5022.60 - 5028.60] P:1460.79 E:0.096524 |  of what would become a seventh defeat in their last 10 matches.
[5028.60 - 5033.60] P:1579.07 E:0.085715 |  Absolutely extraordinary and unthinkable in many ways.
[5033.60 - 5036.60] P:1729.43 E:0.096257 |  But they have lifted it, and it shows you that they're capable of doing it
[5036.60 - 5038.60] P:1708.17 E:0.080524 |  and playing at that height.
[5038.60 - 5042.60] P:1551.03 E:0.081919 |  What it does ensure you is that they can keep on playing that way
[5042.60 - 5046.60] P:1607.18 E:0.081358 |  for sustained periods of time, and that's maybe the bigger question.
[5046.60 - 5050.60] P:1591.54 E:0.090480 |  Love the two managers. It looks as though it's going to be Thiago Mota,
[5050.60 - 5057.60] P:1540.35 E:0.089685 |  the tall, rather urbane, former Italian and former Brazilian international,
[5057.60 - 5059.60] P:1852.97 E:0.099660 |  who's going to make the first couple of changes.
[5059.60 - 5064.60] P:1501.04 E:0.093228 |  Timothy Ware is being prepared to come on as is Western McKinney,
[5064.60 - 5068.60] P:1439.31 E:0.094943 |  the American international, who had that spell on loan at Leeds.
[5068.60 - 5070.60] P:1583.62 E:0.088770 |  That's very attack-minded, isn't it?
[5070.60 - 5072.60] P:1716.83 E:0.057441 |  Yep. Two strikers.
[5072.60 - 5077.60] P:1561.58 E:0.097644 |  McKinney can play in all sorts of positions, can't he?
[5077.60 - 5080.60] P:1516.98 E:0.103564 |  Lewis playing the ball towards the left-hand side.
[5080.60 - 5082.60] P:1541.00 E:0.084561 |  Grealish now.
[5082.60 - 5085.60] P:1827.85 E:0.088049 |  Grealish turns, gives it back to Gavadio, puts his foot on the ball,
[5085.60 - 5087.60] P:1878.15 E:0.095608 |  square in the D.
[5087.60 - 5090.60] P:1833.74 E:0.106941 |  Oh, Gundawang with a shot that is well saved,
[5090.60 - 5093.60] P:1780.73 E:0.106485 |  diving up to his left, DiGrigorio did well to get to that.
[5093.60 - 5097.60] P:1654.90 E:0.100548 |  I think Gundawang knows how close that is.
[5097.60 - 5100.60] P:1566.28 E:0.094905 |  When you had to play, as a player, your reaction tells you something.
[5100.60 - 5102.60] P:1559.82 E:0.104817 |  He was very close there.
[5102.60 - 5105.60] P:1717.73 E:0.105052 |  Good save again. Bernardo Silva now after short corner,
[5105.60 - 5108.60] P:1727.01 E:0.102508 |  and then Gundawang crosses block behind by Gatti,
[5108.60 - 5111.60] P:1745.94 E:0.106155 |  which the referee says did come back onto Gundawang,
[5111.60 - 5113.60] P:1832.65 E:0.092750 |  so it's a goal kick to Juventus.
[5113.60 - 5117.60] P:1503.98 E:0.102802 |  Again, the speed of the movement, the willingness of everyone to get involved.
[5117.60 - 5120.60] P:1642.25 E:0.077727 |  Before that, it was just so...
[5120.60 - 5123.60] P:1562.54 E:0.092861 |  slag, you know, kind of laid back.
[5123.60 - 5127.60] P:1489.83 E:0.104506 |  Lovely shot. We've got a different angle from here on our monitors by Gundawang.
[5127.60 - 5129.60] P:1550.20 E:0.105258 |  He called it round three players,
[5129.60 - 5132.60] P:1544.27 E:0.107907 |  and he's just got a big right hand to the keeper.
[5132.60 - 5135.60] P:1682.18 E:0.108259 |  He's just going to hit the end so the post can go in.
[5135.60 - 5137.60] P:1768.12 E:0.098349 |  Great play there.
[5137.60 - 5139.60] P:1584.14 E:0.109508 |  Really unlucky.
[5139.60 - 5141.60] P:1782.80 E:0.081482 |  OK, so these two changes,
[5141.60 - 5145.60] P:1870.49 E:0.087068 |  Timothy Weier coming on to replace Conce Sao,
[5145.60 - 5148.60] P:1835.52 E:0.079808 |  and that looks as though it will be a straight swap.
[5148.60 - 5151.60] P:1664.21 E:0.090758 |  He is a wing out, but can play through the middle.
[5151.60 - 5153.60] P:1807.00 E:0.085722 |  And it's...
[5153.60 - 5158.60] P:1866.00 E:0.085006 |  Sorry, K-Fran Turam, who's coming off from the midfield
[5158.60 - 5161.60] P:1640.30 E:0.079749 |  to be replaced by Weston McKenney,
[5161.60 - 5165.60] P:1690.86 E:0.087438 |  who's one of the many Juventus players,
[5165.60 - 5168.60] P:1701.15 E:0.084777 |  just like Manchester City have had,
[5168.60 - 5170.60] P:1858.61 E:0.092753 |  who have been on the injured list.
[5170.60 - 5173.60] P:1812.21 E:0.099968 |  Douglas Louise is back on the bench tonight
[5173.60 - 5175.60] P:1743.93 E:0.094571 |  after his big-money move from Aston Villa.
[5175.60 - 5178.60] P:1721.78 E:0.094455 |  There's actually a bit of talk, isn't there, about Douglas Louise moving back to England,
[5178.60 - 5182.60] P:1515.77 E:0.102014 |  possibly in January, such as those things have not worked out really
[5182.60 - 5184.60] P:1541.25 E:0.101837 |  from here so far.
[5184.60 - 5186.60] P:1702.57 E:0.091750 |  But a double change from Juventus,
[5186.60 - 5190.60] P:1575.37 E:0.087084 |  Manchester City needing a goal, facing defeat.
[5190.60 - 5193.60] P:1587.27 E:0.087717 |  And we are into the final quarter of the match now.
[5193.60 - 5197.60] P:1730.89 E:0.093832 |  1-0 to the home side here, and that's still the case with you.
[5197.60 - 5199.60] P:1660.75 E:0.099691 |  Conor McNamara.
[5199.60 - 5201.60] P:1514.11 E:0.113579 |  Yes, Arsenal leading Monaco by a goal to 0,
[5201.60 - 5203.60] P:1772.68 E:0.107384 |  and the speed chances of both ends here,
[5203.60 - 5205.60] P:1710.91 E:0.106463 |  Oda got just denied by a marvellous save.
[5205.60 - 5207.60] P:1735.80 E:0.109738 |  It probably wouldn't have counted anyway.
[5207.60 - 5209.60] P:1803.97 E:0.112482 |  Gabriel J. Zous was blocking the keeper's view.
[5209.60 - 5211.60] P:1741.07 E:0.101425 |  It would have gone to review to see if he was involved,
[5211.60 - 5213.60] P:1668.55 E:0.118797 |  but the keeper saved anyway, so it didn't matter.
[5213.60 - 5216.60] P:1740.37 E:0.111779 |  Down the other end, Giorgio Gigno gave the ball away
[5216.60 - 5219.60] P:1711.91 E:0.107081 |  and presented a chance to Impolo, who shot low and fractionally wide.
[5219.60 - 5222.60] P:1639.01 E:0.095021 |  Monaco much better now, Arsenal won Monaco 0.
[5222.60 - 5224.60] P:1868.00 E:0.090225 |  Manchester City on the attack here,
[5224.60 - 5226.60] P:1759.88 E:0.098163 |  in Turin on this cold, dry night.
[5226.60 - 5228.60] P:1467.78 E:0.078531 |  Bernardo Silva.
[5228.60 - 5231.60] P:1659.35 E:0.095343 |  Bernardo Silva takes it back out into the full-back position.
[5231.60 - 5233.60] P:1748.00 E:0.090251 |  He uses Jack Grealish.
[5233.60 - 5237.60] P:1333.43 E:0.106446 |  Grealish just drops his shoulder and then runs into Savona,
[5237.60 - 5240.60] P:1354.77 E:0.098379 |  but keeps possession, comes back to him.
[5240.60 - 5242.60] P:1239.02 E:0.085121 |  Two of them working together.
[5242.60 - 5244.60] P:1450.99 E:0.107492 |  Bernardo Silva and Grealish.
[5244.60 - 5246.60] P:1306.87 E:0.096317 |  Big tactical change as well.
[5246.60 - 5248.60] P:1401.82 E:0.082792 |  Grealish has gone left-wing, Dooku has gone right-wing,
[5248.60 - 5250.60] P:1606.55 E:0.098196 |  Bernardo Silva much, much more central,
[5250.60 - 5252.60] P:1351.87 E:0.088520 |  which he will enjoy more.
[5252.60 - 5255.60] P:1544.23 E:0.088963 |  And maybe that will favour Manchester City.
[5255.60 - 5258.60] P:1623.73 E:0.097924 |  Dooku trying to get round D'Anello, but couldn't do so.
[5258.60 - 5261.60] P:1627.87 E:0.095268 |  Yieldies was back in there, helping him out,
[5261.60 - 5264.60] P:1550.31 E:0.107382 |  and then it's chipforked by D'Anello for Coupe Miners.
[5264.60 - 5268.60] P:1726.38 E:0.099470 |  Ruben Diaz is able to come across, put it out of play.
[5268.60 - 5271.60] P:1838.53 E:0.097551 |  Coupe Miners gets a ball from the side of the pitch,
[5271.60 - 5274.60] P:1774.84 E:0.094906 |  takes the throat of Lavaic, who was off and running down the left-hand side,
[5274.60 - 5277.60] P:1834.07 E:0.088919 |  and Guardiola, fortunately, was sharp, stayed with him,
[5277.60 - 5279.60] P:1718.68 E:0.078911 |  and in the end, Edison was able to clear.
[5279.60 - 5281.60] P:1757.12 E:0.098634 |  He's very game-fliavich, isn't he?
[5281.60 - 5285.60] P:1804.65 E:0.088874 |  He won't chase pigeons, he won't go after absolutely anything.
[5285.60 - 5288.60] P:1698.75 E:0.086669 |  Really, really selfless centre forward.
[5288.60 - 5290.60] P:1550.27 E:0.059673 |  The phrase you don't often hear.
[5290.60 - 5293.60] P:1575.28 E:0.083655 |  So, 1-0, Juventus lead.
[5293.60 - 5295.60] P:1418.84 E:0.093347 |  Five-lives from the BBC.
[5295.60 - 5299.60] P:1383.34 E:0.092276 |  Radio Manchester are with us tonight as well for the commentary,
[5299.60 - 5303.60] P:1304.06 E:0.106304 |  as they will be on Sunday, providing the commentary.
[5303.60 - 5306.60] P:1539.87 E:0.105601 |  Radio Manchester and five-lives from the Manchester Derby.
[5306.60 - 5310.60] P:1545.62 E:0.102185 |  Here is Grealish, Grealish back to Lewis,
[5310.60 - 5313.60] P:1718.58 E:0.110143 |  and then Lewis with a high ball across field,
[5313.60 - 5315.60] P:1555.46 E:0.094430 |  taken down by Dooku.
[5315.60 - 5318.60] P:1600.95 E:0.102594 |  Dooku into the penalty area now, then plays it back to the edge,
[5318.60 - 5322.60] P:1643.78 E:0.097973 |  the corner of the box, walker with the cross, stretching header away by Gacchi.
[5322.60 - 5326.60] P:1714.24 E:0.093158 |  It comes out to Guardiola, gets his head down, and the Croatian takes it.
[5326.60 - 5328.60] P:1753.23 E:0.099721 |  The striker take it round the outside of Wehr,
[5328.60 - 5330.60] P:1524.40 E:0.105505 |  who was back there inside his own penalty area
[5330.60 - 5332.60] P:1604.82 E:0.093636 |  to block it behind for a city corner.
[5332.60 - 5334.60] P:1476.84 E:0.109089 |  He's actually won, Guardiola took it further forward,
[5334.60 - 5335.60] P:1688.13 E:0.095917 |  if you possibly can.
[5335.60 - 5337.60] P:1626.28 E:0.096518 |  Yeah, he's one of the centre-backs,
[5337.60 - 5340.60] P:1584.19 E:0.099417 |  but he's also a danger coming in from left-hand side when he gets forward.
[5340.60 - 5343.60] P:1731.46 E:0.104539 |  Corner taken short, Grealish receives it from Bernardo Silva,
[5343.60 - 5346.60] P:1388.19 E:0.097597 |  then back to De Bruyne, now back to Bernardo Silva again.
[5346.60 - 5350.60] P:1639.99 E:0.092599 |  Bernardo Silva leaves Yildiz on his backside,
[5350.60 - 5353.60] P:1856.60 E:0.097475 |  then the shot from Best Bar to 25 yards,
[5353.60 - 5355.60] P:1819.59 E:0.098091 |  misses over the top of the bar from De Bruyne,
[5355.60 - 5359.60] P:1668.95 E:0.097863 |  and it remains for straight, Inglis Manchester City, one-nil down.
[5359.60 - 5363.60] P:1494.85 E:0.092520 |  It is, and it's not the fact that Juvenas have decided just to set back.
[5363.60 - 5366.60] P:1743.91 E:0.093629 |  They've been pushed back, they've been pushed back by a better side,
[5366.60 - 5368.60] P:1545.48 E:0.103924 |  who look lively, who look up for it,
[5368.60 - 5371.60] P:1607.85 E:0.086836 |  who look as if they understand the importance of this.
[5371.60 - 5375.60] P:1672.58 E:0.093400 |  They kind of keep on saying, oh, we'll do it in the next one, we'll do it in the next one.
[5375.60 - 5378.60] P:1577.90 E:0.096879 |  They're running out of games, not only in Europe, but domestically as well.
[5378.60 - 5379.60] P:1814.01 E:0.075402 |  They are.
[5379.60 - 5383.60] P:1455.73 E:0.093925 |  One-nil to Juventus, a woman just makes her way behind us,
[5383.60 - 5389.60] P:1612.87 E:0.092263 |  she was wrapped in a blanket and had a big, fur-ringed poncho on.
[5389.60 - 5394.60] P:1651.95 E:0.091356 |  She wasn't taking any risks with the cold, churin weather.
[5394.60 - 5400.60] P:1422.66 E:0.089465 |  Well, she goes down the stairs, there's Manchester City,
[5400.60 - 5404.60] P:1417.31 E:0.099722 |  take a throw-in on the halfway line.
[5405.60 - 5407.60] P:1749.22 E:0.100313 |  Here's Grealish.
[5407.60 - 5415.60] P:1395.01 E:0.094560 |  Grealish, back to the halfway line to Gavardiol, now Ruben Diaz.
[5415.60 - 5421.60] P:1550.77 E:0.099043 |  Diaz, one of the leaders, part of the leadership group that all the top teams,
[5421.60 - 5424.60] P:1663.18 E:0.111104 |  probably most of the not-top teams have as well now as well,
[5424.60 - 5429.60] P:1396.96 E:0.092551 |  it's all the Rages now, leadership group, Gavardiol, then back to Lewis.
[5429.60 - 5433.60] P:1462.86 E:0.093267 |  Manchester City needs someone to step up here, Kyle Walker.
[5434.60 - 5437.60] P:1582.58 E:0.097344 |  And even a draw for Manchester City would have them struggling
[5437.60 - 5439.60] P:1573.13 E:0.100398 |  in terms of getting into that top eight.
[5439.60 - 5445.60] P:1418.62 E:0.091104 |  Also Milan have been pegged back, Red Star Belgrade have made it 1-1 against Milan,
[5445.60 - 5448.60] P:1591.09 E:0.094216 |  the seven times European champions.
[5448.60 - 5453.60] P:1527.03 E:0.093767 |  Juventus have won it only twice, record winners of the Italian league though.
[5453.60 - 5456.60] P:1524.19 E:0.082414 |  Manchester City though, through the middle,
[5456.60 - 5462.60] P:1672.30 E:0.077865 |  winners of the English championship, four years running.
[5462.60 - 5467.60] P:1678.77 E:0.080173 |  But back it goes towards the halfway line, Lewis now, for City,
[5467.60 - 5472.60] P:1650.70 E:0.085389 |  gets it going again, carries it forward, closer to the heart of the Juventus half.
[5472.60 - 5477.60] P:1665.58 E:0.082893 |  But it's black and white stripes, very much in the I-Lines,
[5477.60 - 5483.60] P:1639.32 E:0.104016 |  as Dooku then runs into Danilo, and Danilo will look to play it away,
[5483.60 - 5488.60] P:1696.97 E:0.105505 |  uses Vlavage, then Danilo, and he has McKenny, and McKenny to wear,
[5488.60 - 5491.60] P:1613.59 E:0.096736 |  and wear, sprinting into the penalty area on the right-hand side,
[5491.60 - 5497.60] P:1787.72 E:0.104894 |  went for the cross, hit Lewis, another cross, and then the chance to score!
[5497.60 - 5502.60] P:1720.24 E:0.116973 |  And that is 2-0 to Juventus, and Leicester McKenny,
[5502.60 - 5509.60] P:1637.43 E:0.111988 |  drives it in from 10 yards, and Manchester City have got real problems
[5509.60 - 5513.60] P:1691.61 E:0.110047 |  in the Champions League now, 2-0 down here.
[5513.60 - 5517.60] P:1659.54 E:0.110520 |  Well, I said to him about 10 minutes ago, he's played that high lane,
[5517.60 - 5522.60] P:1814.73 E:0.111177 |  they will eventually play through it. I would bet I thought it was offside,
[5522.60 - 5526.60] P:1901.43 E:0.105025 |  but he's played that ball through there, and it's a chance you take
[5526.60 - 5530.60] P:1826.32 E:0.096995 |  when you're trying to play that high lane, after a time to right, it's been coming.
[5530.60 - 5534.60] P:1843.00 E:0.105089 |  You just don't seem quick enough to get back in those sort of areas,
[5534.60 - 5538.60] P:1893.33 E:0.101516 |  and again, brilliant substitution to do that in McKenny.
[5538.60 - 5542.60] P:1874.48 E:0.099438 |  Look, do you know what? It looks offside, but it isn't,
[5542.60 - 5546.60] P:1889.83 E:0.091047 |  because Diaz is playing them on, I think, in the near side here,
[5546.60 - 5549.60] P:1702.74 E:0.092109 |  and there's no reason for him to do that, apart from anything else.
[5549.60 - 5553.60] P:1772.08 E:0.090027 |  What a finish by McKenny, absolutely brilliant.
[5553.60 - 5557.60] P:1761.69 E:0.096397 |  Very similar to the hook shot that we've seen a little bit earlier on
[5557.60 - 5561.60] P:1733.37 E:0.094342 |  from Gatti when he broke up there, that led to the first goal.
[5561.60 - 5565.60] P:1736.43 E:0.112401 |  Super shot, 2-0, long, long way back for Manchester City now.
[5565.60 - 5571.60] P:1738.54 E:0.108616 |  Well, listen to this, there are just over 40,000 people inside this stadium,
[5571.60 - 5575.60] P:1506.08 E:0.100357 |  and my goodness, they are creating some atmosphere.
[5575.60 - 5580.60] P:1660.03 E:0.092885 |  Many of their flags are now waving again, the Juventus supporters,
[5580.60 - 5583.60] P:1634.73 E:0.099346 |  this will do them the power of good.
[5583.60 - 5587.60] P:1747.38 E:0.101846 |  Remember, they have only lost once all season in all competitions,
[5587.60 - 5592.60] P:1807.61 E:0.107575 |  but now Manchester City are really staring at the prospect of a seventh defeat
[5592.60 - 5596.60] P:1932.08 E:0.099631 |  in their last 10 matches, as Grealish can't reach this,
[5596.60 - 5600.60] P:1745.27 E:0.101302 |  and it's out of play for a throwing to Juventus in their own right back area.
[5600.60 - 5605.60] P:1604.33 E:0.103492 |  Well, on Saturday here, Juventus came back from 2-0 down,
[5605.60 - 5610.60] P:1706.82 E:0.099980 |  but Manchester City, it just felt that that next goal was so important,
[5610.60 - 5614.60] P:1758.47 E:0.100622 |  and it's gone to Juventus, who are 2-0 up.
[5614.60 - 5617.60] P:1685.04 E:0.105610 |  Let's go to Hawthorne's, Sani Radrava-Jula.
[5617.60 - 5620.60] P:1711.56 E:0.105565 |  Same score as you've got, Inter in now, West Bromwich Albion,
[5620.60 - 5624.60] P:1799.87 E:0.104602 |  2-0, Coventry City, 0-0, Carl and Grant skipping past two players,
[5624.60 - 5628.60] P:1898.33 E:0.096819 |  shooting from the edge of the area and finding the bottom corner for his fifth of the season.
[5628.60 - 5631.60] P:1790.15 E:0.090030 |  Very hard to see a way back for Coventry City now.
[5631.60 - 5634.60] P:1763.93 E:0.092642 |  76 going West Bromwich Albion, Coventry City, 0-0.
[5634.60 - 5639.60] P:1678.19 E:0.092655 |  Real Madrid are now 2-0 up at Celtic in the Women's Champions League,
[5639.60 - 5644.60] P:1777.35 E:0.089097 |  and Watford have equalised against Hull City with a goal from Rocco Varta.
[5644.60 - 5650.60] P:1763.53 E:0.087692 |  So Hull City won, Watford won, 2-0 to Juventus here,
[5650.60 - 5655.60] P:1684.23 E:0.090474 |  and this is going to leave Manchester City in a perilous position
[5655.60 - 5661.60] P:1612.17 E:0.089422 |  with eight points from six matches and two to play in January,
[5661.60 - 5666.60] P:1827.28 E:0.091481 |  in France against PSG, and then at home to Club Bruges.
[5666.60 - 5669.60] P:2068.52 E:0.105478 |  But it might already be beyond them to finish in the top eight.
[5669.60 - 5672.60] P:2085.68 E:0.109214 |  As I said, you had this shot before.
[5672.60 - 5675.60] P:2113.93 E:0.108583 |  I think it has been behind it for something.
[5675.60 - 5680.60] P:1869.78 E:0.109915 |  Harlan now, but can't get there as the ball is played through by Bernardo Silva.
[5680.60 - 5685.60] P:1740.26 E:0.094674 |  Manchester City are going to bring on Savino,
[5685.60 - 5690.60] P:1713.33 E:0.095366 |  and that will be the first change that Pipp Guardiola has made in this match.
[5690.60 - 5692.60] P:1746.64 E:0.093811 |  You must have thought of making the changes at half-time,
[5692.60 - 5694.60] P:1548.16 E:0.090978 |  and given them a bit of a while.
[5694.60 - 5698.60] P:1762.03 E:0.092169 |  After you lost the goal, you're probably ready to make a change there,
[5698.60 - 5700.60] P:1530.97 E:0.082973 |  and I think you had Foden ready to come on.
[5700.60 - 5702.60] P:1571.63 E:0.106835 |  Manchester City had their best period.
[5702.60 - 5704.60] P:1528.21 E:0.094329 |  You've got to say that.
[5704.60 - 5708.60] P:1580.16 E:0.092231 |  The best period of Manchester City's game was between losing the first goal
[5708.60 - 5710.60] P:1565.82 E:0.083469 |  and losing the second goal.
[5710.60 - 5712.60] P:1587.23 E:0.103215 |  It's a little bit of a shame on them.
[5712.60 - 5715.60] P:1574.19 E:0.092404 |  That's a wee bit harsh on them that they did lose that second goal then.
[5715.60 - 5718.60] P:1662.43 E:0.078093 |  But that high line they were playing is always a danger
[5718.60 - 5721.60] P:1808.13 E:0.088400 |  when you've got questionable centre-back tearing.
[5721.60 - 5723.60] P:1862.45 E:0.097696 |  Don't play together all the time.
[5723.60 - 5726.60] P:2058.47 E:0.103181 |  We talked about this before, the time with Kelly K.
[5726.60 - 5729.60] P:2144.45 E:0.092186 |  You're playing a game if you're changing keeper,
[5729.60 - 5731.60] P:2026.62 E:0.082492 |  but it's changing that back line,
[5731.60 - 5734.60] P:1931.10 E:0.086347 |  whether it's because you have to or not,
[5734.60 - 5737.60] P:1843.15 E:0.069835 |  all the time it seems every single week.
[5737.60 - 5740.60] P:1766.40 E:0.096462 |  You've got to let them play with each other and understand where each other is.
[5740.60 - 5742.60] P:1836.61 E:0.084470 |  And they lost that goal there.
[5742.60 - 5745.60] P:1715.80 E:0.051485 |  It's because they didn't know where each other was.
[5746.60 - 5749.60] P:1744.13 E:0.105655 |  Manchester City make the change, and it's Savino,
[5749.60 - 5753.60] P:1737.83 E:0.084596 |  who's still yet to score his first goal for Manchester City,
[5753.60 - 5756.60] P:1753.29 E:0.082412 |  who probably understandably comes on for Dooku,
[5756.60 - 5759.60] P:1629.66 E:0.087420 |  who started tonight, but that was only his second start since October.
[5759.60 - 5763.60] P:1746.98 E:0.089096 |  Barcelona have gone back in front in Germany against Dortmund.
[5763.60 - 5766.60] P:1660.21 E:0.084160 |  Ferrant Torres has got that goal, so Dortmund won.
[5766.60 - 5770.60] P:1658.12 E:0.097324 |  Barcelona 2, and Preston are now 2-0 up on Cardiff.
[5770.60 - 5774.60] P:1636.32 E:0.093901 |  Militin Osmaic has got a late goal there
[5774.60 - 5777.60] P:1743.79 E:0.085527 |  to presumably clinch it for Preston,
[5777.60 - 5780.60] P:1602.97 E:0.085377 |  which would be their first win since October.
[5780.60 - 5785.60] P:1635.69 E:0.088836 |  Cardiff 0-Preston 2, and Stuttgart 5-1 up on Young Boys now.
[5785.60 - 5788.60] P:1629.69 E:0.086506 |  Arsenal still winning 1-0 against Monaco.
[5788.60 - 5794.60] P:1703.16 E:0.097822 |  Pukajosak has first half goal, and Manchester City 2-0 down here.
[5794.60 - 5799.60] P:1750.43 E:0.093733 |  And Savino with his first attempt to break down the right conceder,
[5799.60 - 5802.60] P:1790.76 E:0.095550 |  throwing 4-0 in 10 yards away from the corner flag.
[5802.60 - 5805.60] P:1779.84 E:0.092598 |  It was 1-0 to Arsenal, Conor McNamara.
[5805.60 - 5809.60] P:1890.68 E:0.112309 |  They've just made it 2, same goal scored, Pukajosak,
[5809.60 - 5813.60] P:1842.00 E:0.107305 |  and this will move Arsenal even further up the Asit stands table.
[5813.60 - 5816.60] P:1854.33 E:0.108262 |  They're up to fourth place now.
[5816.60 - 5819.60] P:1786.72 E:0.108301 |  Monaco, who came out in good determined mood at the start of this second half,
[5819.60 - 5821.60] P:1661.77 E:0.115341 |  they've given it a real goal,
[5821.60 - 5825.60] P:1798.12 E:0.107478 |  but Arsenal reasserting the dominance they showed in the first half.
[5825.60 - 5828.60] P:1741.10 E:0.107373 |  They're 12.5 minutes to play, two goals from Saka.
[5828.60 - 5830.60] P:1495.31 E:0.108732 |  Arsenal 2-Monaco 0.
[5830.60 - 5835.60] P:1937.72 E:0.096431 |  Arsenal in very good heart. Liverpool top of the table, Barcelona second,
[5835.60 - 5837.60] P:1966.32 E:0.085019 |  Arsenal third, Aston Villa in fifth,
[5837.60 - 5843.60] P:1719.75 E:0.074348 |  and as we know after Celtics draw yesterday, Celtic,
[5843.60 - 5848.60] P:1796.14 E:0.087273 |  in very much with a chance of getting a playoff place in February,
[5848.60 - 5850.60] P:1960.95 E:0.095274 |  down in 21st currently,
[5850.60 - 5855.60] P:2011.43 E:0.090733 |  but they are ahead of Manchester City in the table still.
[5855.60 - 5859.60] P:2147.10 E:0.097572 |  They have every belief that Celtic will get in there.
[5859.60 - 5862.60] P:2153.66 E:0.109752 |  Manchester City, walk up.
[5862.60 - 5865.60] P:2160.14 E:0.103323 |  We're into the 81st minute now.
[5865.60 - 5868.60] P:2153.15 E:0.109932 |  Listen, there's nothing to say that Manchester City can't come up
[5868.60 - 5871.60] P:2163.47 E:0.098215 |  with a couple of goals, quick, sharp,
[5871.60 - 5877.60] P:2196.93 E:0.102723 |  but in their current state, then that is stretching belief,
[5877.60 - 5879.60] P:2169.07 E:0.091192 |  but we'll see, walk up.
[5879.60 - 5881.60] P:2085.84 E:0.091583 |  Now to Kevin De Bruyne.
[5881.60 - 5883.60] P:2107.22 E:0.095891 |  De Bruyne, then square from him.
[5883.60 - 5885.60] P:2064.52 E:0.109189 |  Last we looked, which wasn't too long ago,
[5885.60 - 5888.60] P:2057.67 E:0.097626 |  Erling Harlan had only 13 touches in this match,
[5888.60 - 5892.60] P:2017.88 E:0.098519 |  had a big chance in the first half that was saved by D. Gregorio,
[5892.60 - 5894.60] P:2017.22 E:0.094799 |  two important saves from him.
[5894.60 - 5896.60] P:1825.77 E:0.096642 |  De Bruyne has balled now into the eventless penalty area,
[5896.60 - 5898.60] P:1757.00 E:0.095712 |  that's headed down and away by Locca Telli,
[5898.60 - 5902.60] P:1693.48 E:0.096777 |  that Manchester City through Dias are able to play it back to Edison
[5902.60 - 5905.60] P:1745.66 E:0.094268 |  who wanders out of his penalty area.
[5905.60 - 5908.60] P:1729.72 E:0.094495 |  The two goals are not a match in this season,
[5908.60 - 5910.60] P:1795.16 E:0.085287 |  but it's a win for the team,
[5910.60 - 5913.60] P:1547.87 E:0.111002 |  and we will see them whistle shortly in the 7-45 kick-offs.
[5913.60 - 5916.60] P:1633.28 E:0.101709 |  It has gone at the den with you, Aaron Paul.
[5916.60 - 5920.60] P:1666.59 E:0.106004 |  Neil Harris bids farewell to the den on the back of the feet,
[5920.60 - 5923.60] P:1899.33 E:0.101260 |  his side beating courtesy of a first half where he had a brew
[5923.60 - 5926.60] P:1805.80 E:0.107232 |  strike, Mill will hit the post twice,
[5926.60 - 5928.60] P:1758.93 E:0.096955 |  but couldn't find a level.
[5928.60 - 5931.60] P:1787.10 E:0.094022 |  The win though, takes Sheffield United, top of the league,
[5931.60 - 5933.60] P:1859.43 E:0.101026 |  Mill will nil, Sheffield United won,
[5933.60 - 5938.32] P:1857.30 E:0.088941 |  joined us after 10 o'clock on five lives tonight and Manchester said he with
[5938.32 - 5942.56] P:1980.40 E:0.096096 |  Grealish, Grealish then rolls his foot over the ball turns back in field
[5942.56 - 5946.12] P:1927.93 E:0.098852 |  still he's being chased he might have been shoved over there he was freekick
[5946.12 - 5950.56] P:1673.29 E:0.099101 |  given for the challenge by Locketeli so freekick to Manchester city 25 yards
[5950.56 - 5953.88] P:1222.54 E:0.100901 |  out Pat Nevin. It's a good thing to remember the times and the ball was placed there
[5953.88 - 5958.64] P:1489.78 E:0.087570 |  watch Kevin De Bruyne and walk up to everything this is a great good chance
[5958.64 - 5963.36] P:1706.31 E:0.075683 |  it still is a chance because you know the quality he's got but it just
[5963.36 - 5967.60] P:1745.88 E:0.084768 |  the quality hasn't been there with Kevin De Bruyne most of the time tonight but
[5967.60 - 5973.00] P:1607.15 E:0.084664 |  you know he's capable that's the thing it only needs that one moment for him to
[5973.00 - 5976.04] P:1667.67 E:0.095079 |  put it in the top corner it's maybe about three or four yards further out than he
[5976.04 - 5980.96] P:1686.98 E:0.077989 |  would like. De Bruyne waiting the event is for organizing themselves I can tell
[5980.96 - 5985.04] P:1835.77 E:0.108034 |  you it has finished whole city one Wapford one in Rubenssellers his first
[5985.04 - 5991.60] P:2044.29 E:0.095082 |  match in charge it at whole city and also it's finished Cardiff nil Preston
[5991.84 - 5996.44] P:1915.92 E:0.094983 |  De Bruyne now ready takes the freekick to the back post Diaz headed across the
[5996.44 - 6002.60] P:1783.99 E:0.083057 |  event as spots but that was comfortably cleared out for a throw down on this side
[6002.60 - 6006.88] P:1607.33 E:0.095979 |  of the pitch where Pep Guardiola with his hands in his pockets sweeping back the
[6006.88 - 6013.40] P:1708.24 E:0.070654 |  sides of that padded coat facing yet another defeat. It's a funny thing because
[6013.40 - 6017.92] P:1604.89 E:0.090822 |  you look Pep Guardiola has been Brown for a long long time but no one's perfect and
[6017.92 - 6021.38] P:1775.34 E:0.081394 |  everyone makes mistakes so you know when you look at that second goal
[6021.38 - 6026.70] P:1598.17 E:0.076791 |  where it came from there's no left back there is no left back and the
[6026.70 - 6029.90] P:1732.02 E:0.108937 |  ball she's played in there there's a massive amount of space where's your left
[6029.90 - 6035.02] P:1830.55 E:0.096617 |  back sitting in the centre of my field. Grealish is committed to foul so
[6035.02 - 6038.34] P:1740.30 E:0.099810 |  Juventus who were playing the ball downfield but it was over hit so the
[6038.34 - 6042.66] P:1857.42 E:0.096599 |  referee's brought it back and it's the yellow card for Grealish for the foul
[6042.66 - 6047.14] P:1831.62 E:0.096475 |  freekick to Juventus. They're absolutely right Pat. For another manager does that
[6047.14 - 6051.82] P:1658.99 E:0.079644 |  and the ball is played completely over where the left back is. There's a
[6051.82 - 6056.82] P:1669.48 E:0.085244 |  gigantic space there and the stretchers defence which is a high lane anyway and
[6056.82 - 6061.34] P:1735.42 E:0.086246 |  they score a goal for it you would ask that question. I suspect in their
[6061.34 - 6066.50] P:1630.02 E:0.079173 |  coverage in the television tonight with Nederman Lads I think they might look at
[6066.50 - 6072.58] P:1705.86 E:0.105015 |  that. If you haven't heard by the way from this season from 10 o'clock
[6072.94 - 6077.22] P:1899.67 E:0.096590 |  tonight all of these midweek Champions League matches you can see the
[6077.22 - 6083.26] P:1850.32 E:0.088065 |  highlights from all of them that's on the iPlayer and then there is the match
[6083.26 - 6088.38] P:1882.70 E:0.086277 |  of the day the Champions League match of the day which is on after the news this
[6088.38 - 6095.62] P:1904.00 E:0.102718 |  evening with Mark Chapman and the team. A couple more changes for Juventus
[6095.62 - 6101.78] P:1937.94 E:0.096411 |  Yildiz and Vláovic are being substituted. Vláovic scored his tenth goal for
[6102.42 - 6109.62] P:1838.26 E:0.076460 |  Juventus this season tonight and Vláovic goes, applauds to the crowd with
[6109.62 - 6115.22] P:1750.91 E:0.081025 |  Samuel Ambangula the Belgian under 21 international winger another of the
[6115.22 - 6122.42] P:1799.15 E:0.082200 |  youngsters the 20 year old coming on and also Douglas Louise making his return.
[6122.42 - 6128.26] P:1916.70 E:0.085182 |  He's not played since October Douglas Louise after a hamstring injury so the
[6128.26 - 6132.86] P:1674.18 E:0.086988 |  former Aston Villa and indeed Manchester City man is on to the field number
[6132.86 - 6138.90] P:1723.90 E:0.090719 |  26 as he is for Juventus. 2-0 Juventus lead just five minutes to play Pat.
[6138.90 - 6142.10] P:1667.45 E:0.080122 |  Yeah and they have managed to calm it down. There weren't any big things that
[6142.10 - 6146.26] P:1663.55 E:0.081763 |  Juvi have got. You know when they've got the first goal there and they sat back a
[6146.26 - 6153.06] P:1560.33 E:0.090575 |  little bit and went into that system which was almost a 5-3, a 5-4-1 and you
[6153.06 - 6157.42] P:1484.66 E:0.093290 |  thought he looked really comfortable there they've done that before and it was
[6157.46 - 6160.90] P:1597.75 E:0.093104 |  very very hard for Manchester City to break through and they made a couple of
[6160.90 - 6165.54] P:1689.01 E:0.093655 |  chances but they've not been able to keep up the entire time for as long as you
[6165.54 - 6169.18] P:1735.81 E:0.089307 |  need to do to keep on creating chances however he is one.
[6169.18 - 6174.78] P:1800.58 E:0.093011 |  De Bruyne on the right ball across and it was actually Douglas Louise who was there
[6174.78 - 6178.54] P:1742.19 E:0.105815 |  in position with his first touch inside the penalty area he was trying to pick
[6178.54 - 6182.78] P:1778.10 E:0.106758 |  out Gundawan on the edge of the box and now Bernardo Silva's got involved in a
[6182.82 - 6188.42] P:1803.83 E:0.105273 |  bit of nonsense with Gatti and De Gregorio. Yellow card for Bernardo Silva.
[6188.42 - 6194.54] P:1822.28 E:0.096173 |  That's so harsh. When little Bernardo Silva goes in, he keeps us wasting time.
[6194.54 - 6199.46] P:1736.75 E:0.095919 |  The centre-back's mucking about as well. He's tried to go in and close the ball down a
[6199.46 - 6204.14] P:1687.24 E:0.101861 |  little bit and as he's going in to get him to go the defenders can have backed
[6204.14 - 6208.78] P:1605.00 E:0.092007 |  himself into him a little bit. He's just standing his ground there and then they
[6208.78 - 6212.70] P:1553.00 E:0.090618 |  are going up Bernardo Silva. That's very big and brave of you. Well done.
[6212.70 - 6215.54] P:1830.60 E:0.101032 |  It's a real two-ventus.
[6218.22 - 6224.70] P:2087.49 E:0.096669 |  Manchester City supporters in their corner of the ground. They're in a sort of
[6224.70 - 6231.46] P:1860.80 E:0.077714 |  wedge-shaped section of seats on the far side. They're just getting their
[6231.50 - 6239.26] P:1673.91 E:0.090026 |  information for the end of the match. Mateusz Nunez is going to be the
[6239.26 - 6245.54] P:1656.35 E:0.091499 |  second change that Pep Guardiola has made tonight and Jack Grealish having
[6245.54 - 6250.14] P:1805.92 E:0.101355 |  been yellow carded is sprinting off the pitch and Mateusz Nunez takes his place.
[6250.14 - 6254.10] P:1911.92 E:0.099331 |  Three and a half minutes to go.
[6254.10 - 6258.90] P:1941.65 E:0.088956 |  Tell your story. He didn't go to Foden. You know you think the table is clear you need but
[6258.90 - 6262.82] P:1735.89 E:0.084779 |  those had such a difficult season and obviously injuries on top of that.
[6262.82 - 6268.06] P:1904.64 E:0.080797 |  It's almost wide ball. I'll tell you what, Walker there.
[6268.06 - 6270.90] P:1812.41 E:0.087929 |  He's lucky going with that.
[6270.90 - 6277.14] P:1689.30 E:0.093455 |  Douglas Louise fell off the pitch near the corner flag.
[6277.14 - 6279.14] P:1568.34 E:0.086307 |  Phil?
[6279.14 - 6281.14] P:1707.04 E:0.100315 |  There's a push there.
[6281.38 - 6290.34] P:1630.86 E:0.078712 |  And then fell over. So goal kick to Manchester City and Kyle Walker carries
[6290.34 - 6293.34] P:1589.92 E:0.075363 |  the ball towards the halfway line.
[6294.34 - 6299.26] P:1701.51 E:0.093720 |  This was very much needed this victory for Juventus who've slipped down to sixth
[6299.26 - 6303.62] P:1529.02 E:0.103246 |  place in the league table even though they aren't unbeaten in the Italian league
[6303.62 - 6309.18] P:1666.12 E:0.098364 |  this season. The one defeat they had was in the Champions League group here
[6309.38 - 6314.70] P:1591.48 E:0.092080 |  against Stuttgart and this has got them right back on track for Manchester City.
[6314.70 - 6321.66] P:1562.29 E:0.094993 |  This is quite the decline really from the recent standards in the Champions League.
[6321.66 - 6325.54] P:1676.10 E:0.099331 |  Listen they may well get themselves into the playoff places which is where they
[6325.54 - 6330.46] P:1654.52 E:0.082853 |  are currently which would mean two more matches in February but they are
[6330.46 - 6333.62] P:1680.49 E:0.085095 |  matches Manchester City can well do without. Absolutely.
[6333.62 - 6338.38] P:1968.31 E:0.100920 |  That text just comes through from a friend of mine. The tech here was great but it's over now.
[6339.38 - 6341.38] P:1847.57 E:0.085263 |  Maybe push that a bit there.
[6341.38 - 6343.38] P:1622.79 E:0.097203 |  But there's a lot of people feel that isn't there?
[6343.38 - 6345.38] P:1690.87 E:0.091126 |  Well I think reports of his demise.
[6345.38 - 6347.38] P:1768.83 E:0.095684 |  Yes.
[6347.38 - 6349.38] P:1731.10 E:0.084590 |  Here is Gundawand, Gundawand of Bernardo Silva.
[6349.38 - 6351.38] P:1905.70 E:0.104527 |  Bernardo Silva with the cross.
[6351.38 - 6353.38] P:1922.61 E:0.086578 |  Harlan with a touch.
[6353.38 - 6355.38] P:1718.22 E:0.096147 |  It bounces off Savona.
[6355.38 - 6357.38] P:1599.32 E:0.096103 |  He was a little fortunate there.
[6357.38 - 6359.38] P:1293.25 E:0.093069 |  They took it away from two of his teammates and Savona was able to clear.
[6359.38 - 6361.38] P:1492.19 E:0.115720 |  He sat even Harlan now.
[6361.38 - 6366.38] P:1460.74 E:0.104099 |  I wouldn't say disinterested but there's not really that sharpness about him here.
[6366.58 - 6370.58] P:1437.59 E:0.091797 |  He's been running all night and nothing has really played into him that he can attack at any point.
[6370.58 - 6372.58] P:1175.35 E:0.099974 |  Yeah.
[6372.58 - 6374.58] P:1493.61 E:0.107380 |  Apart from that one chance.
[6374.58 - 6378.58] P:1632.42 E:0.098555 |  Even though Manchester City have had lots of possession really relatively few chances
[6378.58 - 6383.58] P:1569.14 E:0.088925 |  created and when they have made good chances, D. Gregorio has kept them out.
[6383.58 - 6385.58] P:1735.70 E:0.104306 |  Here's Mateus Nunez.
[6385.58 - 6388.58] P:1539.30 E:0.094303 |  2-0 Juventus League, 5-Live Radio Manchester on BBC Sounds.
[6388.58 - 6390.58] P:1609.39 E:0.100353 |  Still 2-0 to Arsenal as well.
[6390.58 - 6394.58] P:1672.42 E:0.095964 |  Two goals from Bukai Osaka will get you all the details from that after 10 o'clock as well.
[6394.78 - 6398.78] P:1452.01 E:0.092254 |  Bernardo Silva across to Gundawan who plays it back to Ruben Diaz.
[6398.78 - 6403.78] P:1529.04 E:0.094229 |  It's now Bruce Adolphe and two Barcelona, three Ferentoraz with the second goal of the match.
[6403.78 - 6412.78] P:1657.44 E:0.082692 |  Feyenoord 4-2 upon Sparta Prague now as Rico Luis plays it back to De Bruyne.
[6412.78 - 6415.78] P:1563.27 E:0.088628 |  De Bruyne has balled into Gundawan.
[6415.78 - 6419.78] P:1789.41 E:0.100003 |  Luis with a shot deflected but straight through to the goalkeeper.
[6419.78 - 6423.78] P:1713.81 E:0.099269 |  It actually took it closer to the goalkeeper but the Manchester City players are saying that deflection was off an arm.
[6423.98 - 6427.98] P:1578.90 E:0.101613 |  Both Luis and Gavardi all running towards an appealing to the referee.
[6427.98 - 6432.98] P:1350.47 E:0.101337 |  You will definitely check out when the ball goes out of play.
[6432.98 - 6437.98] P:1434.33 E:0.092082 |  As soon as his hand is going through, how far his hand was out?
[6437.98 - 6439.98] P:1242.79 E:0.103084 |  That's gassy.
[6439.98 - 6444.98] P:1526.42 E:0.099629 |  That could be given as a penalty in Champions League.
[6446.98 - 6451.98] P:1481.18 E:0.094669 |  Two minutes about a time to play and the AR will be looking at that.
[6452.18 - 6456.18] P:1670.09 E:0.106267 |  Let's see what happens when the ball rolls out of play here.
[6456.18 - 6460.18] P:1661.79 E:0.106935 |  I'm sure that referee Turpan will have said to Rico Luis and Gavardi all.
[6460.18 - 6463.18] P:1418.09 E:0.088716 |  Rico Luis has played the ball and again.
[6463.18 - 6465.18] P:1466.56 E:0.075227 |  So that's it. Can't be stopped now.
[6465.18 - 6468.18] P:1673.93 E:0.099931 |  He's taken the throw so players back underway.
[6468.18 - 6471.18] P:1706.59 E:0.112600 |  Let's go back to Arsenal, Conor McNamara.
[6471.18 - 6474.18] P:1688.93 E:0.107198 |  Arsenal are celebrating with a hope for a third goal of the evening.
[6474.18 - 6477.18] P:1762.51 E:0.111340 |  Two minutes to go. Arsenal three-monic on their subject of VAO review.
[6477.38 - 6482.38] P:1658.22 E:0.107463 |  Last touch I think went in off Tilo Kira, the former West Ham United defender,
[6482.38 - 6485.38] P:1684.59 E:0.106990 |  for an own goal but was in an offside decision.
[6485.38 - 6488.38] P:1756.94 E:0.106958 |  They're spending a long time looking at this.
[6488.38 - 6491.38] P:1655.77 E:0.108048 |  I don't think it's going to affect the outcome of the game anyway.
[6491.38 - 6494.38] P:1814.63 E:0.108504 |  But I'm still hoping that they've just made it three-nil here.
[6494.38 - 6496.38] P:1896.62 E:0.100374 |  Yes, confirmed the goal stands.
[6496.38 - 6498.38] P:1891.54 E:0.084643 |  Arsenal three, Monaco nil.
[6498.38 - 6502.38] P:1843.00 E:0.087687 |  So plain sailing for Arsenal tonight against Monaco
[6502.38 - 6505.38] P:1872.39 E:0.094486 |  who have had a very good Champions League to this point.
[6505.58 - 6508.58] P:1775.36 E:0.093880 |  But are now down in 15th place in the table.
[6508.58 - 6512.58] P:1615.67 E:0.088344 |  Here's De Bruyne. De Bruyne, two nil down Manchester City.
[6512.58 - 6514.58] P:1592.27 E:0.092992 |  Gundawang, Bulls played behind him,
[6514.58 - 6517.58] P:1527.93 E:0.096271 |  stuck out a leg at it, then Weyer goes down.
[6517.58 - 6520.58] P:1733.07 E:0.101402 |  I think that was a free kick it was, free kick to the eventers.
[6520.58 - 6523.58] P:1709.77 E:0.100114 |  We're well into added time. Just two minutes of added time to play.
[6523.58 - 6526.58] P:1798.51 E:0.098724 |  Manchester City are heading to another defeat here.
[6526.58 - 6530.58] P:1611.72 E:0.089898 |  Yeah, there was a period I would say for 15 minutes after us,
[6530.58 - 6533.58] P:1666.94 E:0.096575 |  before school, we thought, well, no, they're going to lift it now.
[6533.78 - 6537.78] P:1562.09 E:0.098402 |  British kind of faded. It's slowly but surely faded.
[6537.78 - 6539.78] P:1564.69 E:0.091334 |  And the question I was asking then,
[6539.78 - 6543.78] P:1486.99 E:0.089411 |  have they get the energy to keep that intensity up
[6543.78 - 6545.78] P:1582.36 E:0.086791 |  for the next 40 minutes or so?
[6545.78 - 6549.78] P:1651.82 E:0.092001 |  If you can do that, you'll get a goal and you could get back in this game.
[6549.78 - 6551.78] P:1686.62 E:0.095700 |  Unfortunately for Manchester City,
[6551.78 - 6554.78] P:1749.18 E:0.096513 |  they were absolutely nowhere near capable of keeping up that pace
[6554.78 - 6556.78] P:1668.96 E:0.096908 |  and that intensity and that quality.
[6556.78 - 6559.78] P:1663.68 E:0.096801 |  Milan are winning 2-1 now against Red Star Belgrade.
[6559.78 - 6561.78] P:1636.74 E:0.107455 |  Camille Abraham with a goal.
[6561.98 - 6566.98] P:1550.65 E:0.103741 |  And here is interview with Nader Manua on BBC Sounds right now.
[6566.98 - 6569.98] P:1668.16 E:0.105677 |  But you've entered, so getting ready to celebrate here.
[6569.98 - 6573.98] P:1650.13 E:0.108396 |  This will be a very noteworthy victory.
[6573.98 - 6577.98] P:1619.02 E:0.113849 |  And there is the final whistle here in Turin
[6577.98 - 6581.98] P:1744.95 E:0.101466 |  and a very satisfied Thiago Mota turns
[6581.98 - 6585.98] P:1692.81 E:0.091308 |  and shakes hands with Pep Guardiola,
[6585.98 - 6590.98] P:1784.02 E:0.118525 |  who has just seen his team fall to their seventh defeat
[6591.18 - 6593.18] P:1783.73 E:0.108351 |  in the last 10 matches.
[6593.18 - 6600.18] P:1891.61 E:0.099806 |  And now automatic qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League
[6600.18 - 6602.18] P:1853.94 E:0.106465 |  is probably beyond Manchester City.
[6602.18 - 6605.18] P:1843.83 E:0.105534 |  Yes, beyond Manchester City, I think.
[6605.18 - 6607.18] P:1916.55 E:0.112418 |  But it's not the biggest worry.
[6607.18 - 6609.18] P:1836.59 E:0.115815 |  The biggest worry is you keep on playing like that.
[6609.18 - 6611.18] P:1795.94 E:0.105232 |  There's a chance you don't get through.
[6611.18 - 6613.18] P:1975.97 E:0.097695 |  Then they should still, there'll be two games,
[6613.18 - 6616.18] P:1854.36 E:0.111199 |  then they should still be able to do it just about getting on points.
[6616.18 - 6620.18] P:1829.08 E:0.105962 |  But tonight, the saddest thing about Manchester City,
[6620.38 - 6623.38] P:2022.21 E:0.113782 |  tonight is, are you really shocked?
[6623.38 - 6626.38] P:1936.42 E:0.104351 |  And I'm not. I'm not completely shocked.
[6626.38 - 6629.38] P:1915.42 E:0.107267 |  The way they've been playing recently, the tiredness that they had
[6629.38 - 6632.38] P:1883.29 E:0.113707 |  in that group, obviously we know about the injuries,
[6632.38 - 6635.38] P:2014.56 E:0.110148 |  we know he's having to play players that he would rather rest,
[6635.38 - 6637.38] P:1664.60 E:0.091222 |  that he would rather turn around.
[6637.38 - 6639.38] P:1633.78 E:0.105142 |  He had nobody really to go to in the bench tonight
[6639.38 - 6641.38] P:1643.07 E:0.090833 |  that he thought could change the team.
[6641.38 - 6646.38] P:1952.50 E:0.114103 |  And at the moment, it is hell on hell for Manchester City supporters.
[6646.38 - 6649.38] P:2005.78 E:0.114251 |  They look to me like a team that's not capable of doing it,
[6649.58 - 6651.58] P:1894.07 E:0.106233 |  but they're not in the same intensity.
[6651.58 - 6653.58] P:2002.75 E:0.094427 |  You need to do it at the top level to win these games,
[6653.58 - 6655.58] P:1956.83 E:0.117462 |  week after week, or two or three times a week.
[6655.58 - 6657.58] P:1943.08 E:0.094616 |  In fact, they don't look like it.
[6657.58 - 6659.58] P:2049.22 E:0.106687 |  They simply can't.
[6659.58 - 6662.58] P:2012.00 E:0.096512 |  And the recipe that is for is not to win competitions.
[6662.58 - 6664.58] P:2007.36 E:0.096740 |  They're in real danger.
[6664.58 - 6666.58] P:2135.89 E:0.109128 |  Yeah, well, it was online tonight,
[6666.58 - 6668.58] P:2131.68 E:0.107469 |  even though this was only matchday six,
[6668.58 - 6670.58] P:2014.21 E:0.093047 |  but your vendors have won it.
[6670.58 - 6672.58] P:1993.47 E:0.094559 |  So they're up to 11 points.
[6672.58 - 6675.58] P:2004.21 E:0.095142 |  They've given themselves a chance of getting into that top eight.
[6675.58 - 6677.58] P:2027.42 E:0.090425 |  But for Manchester City,
[6677.78 - 6679.78] P:2102.53 E:0.100720 |  this run of awful form,
[6680.78 - 6684.78] P:1786.21 E:0.096097 |  this highly unexpected run that they're on, continues here.
[6684.78 - 6687.78] P:1983.43 E:0.097394 |  It's been another laboured performance.
[6687.78 - 6690.78] P:1993.85 E:0.102073 |  They've now lost six of their last seven away matches.
[6690.78 - 6695.78] P:1994.30 E:0.093695 |  And Juventus winning it with two second-half goals from Vlahavic
[6695.78 - 6697.78] P:1783.82 E:0.085754 |  and the substitute McKenney.
[6697.78 - 6699.78] P:1592.27 E:0.089826 |  You can hear what it's like here.
[6699.78 - 6702.78] P:1898.64 E:0.099751 |  Manchester City players in Maroon sloping off the pitch,
[6702.78 - 6705.78] P:1890.17 E:0.099038 |  and the Juventus players, they're enjoying this.
[6705.98 - 6708.98] P:1780.04 E:0.097844 |  The club Zebra is down there as well,
[6708.98 - 6710.98] P:1877.56 E:0.097793 |  a part of all of these celebrations.
[6710.98 - 6714.98] P:1671.17 E:0.094443 |  And the Juventus song rings out around the stadium after.
[6714.98 - 6717.98] P:1614.81 E:0.095485 |  Juventus two, Manchester City nil.
[6717.98 - 6721.98] P:1403.54 E:0.101979 |  Harry and Pat Nevin enter in watching those events unfold.
[6721.98 - 6724.98] P:1439.95 E:0.097006 |  And Pat, we've seen various reactions from city players
[6724.98 - 6726.98] P:1343.41 E:0.100697 |  over the last couple of months or so.
[6726.98 - 6730.98] P:1476.17 E:0.105141 |  But as they're making their way off the pitch at Juventus,
[6730.98 - 6732.98] P:1655.16 E:0.074251 |  they just look stunned.
[6733.18 - 6737.18] P:1718.85 E:0.098443 |  They look like they look almost blank in their faces.
[6737.18 - 6739.18] P:1604.52 E:0.079250 |  Yeah, we were talking before the game
[6739.18 - 6741.18] P:1722.19 E:0.092541 |  about what they need to do to change it.
[6741.18 - 6743.18] P:1770.10 E:0.112416 |  That was a big conversation we had.
[6743.18 - 6745.18] P:1891.59 E:0.094523 |  I don't think they really know.
[6745.18 - 6748.18] P:1928.29 E:0.099372 |  And they're walking off looking blank, confused.
[6748.18 - 6751.18] P:2056.13 E:0.100327 |  When you've been a team that's been successful,
[6751.18 - 6754.18] P:1938.71 E:0.109253 |  when you work together, you look around
[6754.18 - 6757.18] P:1653.52 E:0.086337 |  and every player you look at, you know you can trust.
[6757.18 - 6760.18] P:1634.85 E:0.100221 |  Not just to work hard, but to do really good things,
[6760.38 - 6764.38] P:1497.86 E:0.087246 |  to be quality things, to get you out of the hole now and again.
[6764.38 - 6766.38] P:1484.27 E:0.096627 |  They must walk off there, look at Shalongo,
[6766.38 - 6768.38] P:1616.92 E:0.086636 |  who's going to do it for us?
[6768.38 - 6772.38] P:1615.79 E:0.086169 |  And the only player I thought who had a positive, upbeat,
[6772.38 - 6774.38] P:1549.62 E:0.098760 |  lively attitude when he walked off,
[6774.38 - 6776.38] P:1495.40 E:0.097426 |  was probably a player who was quiet on the night
[6776.38 - 6778.38] P:1270.86 E:0.099586 |  and it was early Holland.
[6778.38 - 6780.38] P:1315.33 E:0.109771 |  He seemed to have a different kind of body language
[6780.38 - 6782.38] P:1342.38 E:0.098089 |  from everyone else.
[6782.38 - 6784.38] P:1364.44 E:0.093464 |  But the rest of it, you're right,
[6784.38 - 6786.38] P:1472.31 E:0.089663 |  it's almost shock,
[6786.58 - 6789.58] P:1625.47 E:0.088795 |  it's just a standard stand by that this nightmare
[6789.58 - 6791.58] P:1644.88 E:0.085652 |  just keeps on going.
[6791.58 - 6793.58] P:1608.27 E:0.106246 |  They're underlying it. It wasn't a good first half.
[6793.58 - 6795.58] P:1621.94 E:0.092840 |  Then they lost the goal when they did.
[6795.58 - 6798.58] P:1797.32 E:0.088972 |  Then they raised it and then you had 15 minutes
[6798.58 - 6800.58] P:1727.58 E:0.085749 |  of Manchester City back again.
[6800.58 - 6803.58] P:1739.13 E:0.095631 |  And you thought, right, okay, let's see, can you keep this going?
[6803.58 - 6805.58] P:1747.49 E:0.091980 |  And the answer was simple, no.
[6805.58 - 6807.58] P:1837.26 E:0.098521 |  You couldn't keep it going at that level.
[6807.58 - 6809.58] P:1840.95 E:0.092508 |  And I think that's what that look is
[6809.58 - 6811.58] P:1766.10 E:0.101533 |  when you're walking off.
[6811.58 - 6814.58] P:1926.26 E:0.098071 |  You don't want to look at yourself to some degree,
[6814.78 - 6816.78] P:1830.84 E:0.080915 |  but you look at the other person and think,
[6816.78 - 6818.78] P:1669.52 E:0.080919 |  can you do it anymore?
[6818.78 - 6820.78] P:1619.78 E:0.093807 |  And you never looked at them from that way before.
[6820.78 - 6822.78] P:1741.64 E:0.097621 |  That's a horrifying place to be
[6822.78 - 6824.78] P:1793.73 E:0.093448 |  for a team that could always trust each other.
[6824.78 - 6826.78] P:1791.68 E:0.092042 |  And that's what it looked like to me.
