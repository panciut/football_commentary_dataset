[0.00 - 6.16] P:1802.76 E:0.132302 |  Anthony Taylor is the referee, he blows his whistle and the players and the coaching staff taking me
[8.32 - 13.48] P:1855.97 E:0.145310 |  To warm applause and then Anthony Taylor says right here you go off you go
[14.40 - 19.24] P:1884.04 E:0.124326 |  And Liverpool kickoff the ball is played back. Canate gets his first touch
[19.24 - 24.64] P:1771.67 E:0.123915 |  I think they picked him out there Dion to give him an early touch and he walked it away down the left hand side
[24.64 - 28.20] P:1724.42 E:0.142627 |  Yeah, he's a canate. Absolutely just calm the nerves give him a quick touch
[29.00 - 34.00] P:1713.06 E:0.133555 |  Diagonal, you enjoy this you should enjoy it maybe a few nerves, but he should enjoy this occasion
[34.40 - 37.22] P:1741.23 E:0.131623 |  Van Dyke also gets the ball back and gives it to canate who
[37.36 - 40.40] P:1771.31 E:0.127502 |  Flights a ball over the top looking for the run of Jota through the middle
[40.40 - 46.60] P:1649.18 E:0.126692 |  But that bounces through to Dehaa and welcome to everyone listening around the globe on the BBC World Service
[46.60 - 52.68] P:1682.42 E:0.126195 |  They've just joined us and this is the Manchester United team unchanged from Wednesday night here to here
[53.16 - 59.88] P:1632.64 E:0.128358 |  Wanderzakha, Lindelof, McGuire and Shaw, Maktominay Fred and Bruno Fernandez, Greenwood, Ronaldo and Rashford
[60.32 - 64.52] P:1692.75 E:0.131413 |  Fred, Bruno Fernandez and Rashford were all actually injury doubts
[64.52 - 72.04] P:1724.27 E:0.129705 |  But are all okay to play and here is Fred coming across and just driving the ball out of place straight at Jurgen Klopp actually who dropped it
[72.04 - 75.24] P:1577.04 E:0.123362 |  Should have caught that. Poor drop that from Klopp
[76.12 - 79.40] P:1658.80 E:0.136303 |  A drop from Klopp who named this team Alisson in goal
[79.96 - 86.80] P:1639.64 E:0.126992 |  Alexander Arnold, Canate, Van Dyke and Robertson, Henderson, Katerin Milner, Salah Tamino and Jota
[86.80 - 89.68] P:1593.10 E:0.128192 |  Liverpool unbeaten this season
[89.68 - 93.36] P:1769.51 E:0.126209 |  Unbeaten in 12 matches in all competitions this season and
[94.20 - 101.88] P:1720.95 E:0.122411 |  21 in all if you stretch back into last season and very good winners in Madrid against the Spanish champions on Wednesday
[102.76 - 106.84] P:1735.42 E:0.134958 |  Manchester United sending the ball forward Lindelof but Canate comes across then
[107.40 - 113.48] P:1740.79 E:0.128516 |  Greenwood is onto it through to Bruno Fernandez then a little touch from Rashford trying to give it back to Bruno Fernandez
[113.48 - 119.72] P:1692.88 E:0.117924 |  Appeals for handball it was Kater who came across and blocked the intended pass from Marcus Rashford and Liverpool go back
[119.96 - 123.24] P:1706.70 E:0.134693 |  To the edge of their own penalty area so no Fabinho
[123.24 - 127.84] P:1775.43 E:0.128242 |  You've just joined us as indeed the World Service listeners will have 28 yesterday
[127.92 - 133.16] P:1757.72 E:0.131433 |  But a knock on the knee means he's not able to be involved and that means the gyms Milner is there again
[133.16 - 139.72] P:1756.29 E:0.120504 |  Dion the great dependable 35 years old which is fifth consecutive start this for the 35 year old
[139.72 - 142.16] P:1540.39 E:0.132985 |  Yeah, it doesn't surprise me with the game of this magnitude
[142.16 - 145.08] P:1642.88 E:0.142655 |  He knows the game has been in these games many many times before
[145.48 - 149.28] P:1621.01 E:0.136670 |  He knows the role that he has to play as a leader is dependable
[149.28 - 153.72] P:1639.32 E:0.136714 |  He always gives you eight out of ten. So yeah, I don't think that's a bad choice whatsoever
[154.72 - 156.72] P:1678.37 E:0.119994 |  So it is no no
[156.72 - 160.36] P:1650.14 E:0.129894 |  And it is Liverpool who've got the ball on the right-hand side
[160.36 - 164.84] P:1700.92 E:0.128369 |  They can't keep it in canate tried to get there the pass forward from Alexander-Arnold
[164.84 - 167.84] P:1732.08 E:0.124137 |  So Manchester United with a throw inside their own half
[168.72 - 173.40] P:1616.62 E:0.120676 |  Cannot see an empty seat around the place. It's the host ticket today
[173.40 - 175.60] P:1733.63 E:0.133345 |  No question about that all this weekend
[176.04 - 183.28] P:1745.83 E:0.119372 |  Grace Guise above with occasionally had sunshine. It was raining heavily in Manchester earlier as Greenwood plays the ball back to
[183.44 - 185.44] P:1598.00 E:0.123319 |  Lindelof they will see it back to
[186.28 - 191.68] P:1708.68 E:0.130837 |  Dehaa I did enjoy Bastion shrunch digger earlier in the program talking about how
[192.04 - 195.36] P:1660.81 E:0.141508 |  David Dehaa always used to ask him if he was as good as Manuel Neuer
[195.76 - 198.24] P:1733.94 E:0.131179 |  Not sure he'd necessarily want that in the public arena
[198.24 - 205.38] P:1836.02 E:0.139268 |  Manchester United coming forward the ball played back to Greenwood now. He has Bruno Fernandez drives his shot over the top of the bar
[206.40 - 211.40] P:1841.31 E:0.129369 |  Now was that should there have been an offside flag in that my initial thought John
[211.60 - 219.92] P:1793.90 E:0.131335 |  I thought that Ronaldo was offside listen no flag went up. There was no queries from the officials Bruno Fernandez has to score there
[219.96 - 224.64] P:1806.23 E:0.122730 |  So lovely little run. It's a great little ball through as well. I think it's from Fred. He's on side
[224.64 - 231.64] P:1798.59 E:0.131073 |  Ronaldo's on side lays it into Bruno and he should really score. He's only 12 yards out United should be one up
[232.92 - 236.88] P:1668.51 E:0.122763 |  Yeah, the assistant Gary Bezic on this side spot on
[237.52 - 240.36] P:1730.36 E:0.129221 |  And Manchester United waste the first chance
[240.88 - 244.24] P:1605.61 E:0.116477 |  No, no Bruno Fernandez who started the season
[244.24 - 252.28] P:1695.95 E:0.126726 |  Well, particularly as is Manchester United Korea has been so far Bruno Fernandez with his hat trick here against Leeds United
[252.28 - 259.76] P:1730.41 E:0.138917 |  But just one goal in 11 appearances since then however, it's still being his same creative self
[260.48 - 264.96] P:1626.90 E:0.113178 |  Robertson sending a pass forward McGuire comes across chess sit down and then
[265.12 - 268.16] P:1694.48 E:0.120046 |  Lindelof will clear took a deflection for me
[268.16 - 271.80] P:1753.84 E:0.118655 |  No heads it forward John keeps it in actually on the left wing the number 20
[272.00 - 273.44] P:1729.50 E:0.119262 |  Diogo Jota
[273.44 - 280.80] P:1696.50 E:0.125195 |  And the bench the last couple of matches came on and was heavily involved in Madrid the other evening both in the winning of the penalty
[281.20 - 285.32] P:1717.94 E:0.127675 |  and in the conceding of the penalty that never was to
[285.92 - 288.36] P:1666.13 E:0.105960 |  to Atlético Madrid for which
[288.48 - 295.12] P:1806.39 E:0.132809 |  I thought the place was going to go mad for me. No place it through the Salah. This could be dangerous Salah now to cater
[295.68 - 297.68] P:1854.46 E:0.135717 |  One-on-one scores
[297.68 - 303.24] P:1792.21 E:0.138514 |  Liverpool have an early lead here in the fifth minute this time at Salah who set it up
[303.40 - 308.92] P:1751.40 E:0.131805 |  Just a little pass to his right into the area to cater and a composed finish from him
[308.92 - 315.96] P:1684.79 E:0.129511 |  And it's Manchester United now Liverpool one that is some finish that is some start by Liverpool
[315.96 - 320.00] P:1673.38 E:0.133240 |  What a lovely ball from Salah, but some really good play down the left-hand side
[320.72 - 322.72] P:1704.79 E:0.120295 |  Jota and Milner
[322.76 - 327.08] P:1652.63 E:0.128474 |  Little triangles nice little play nice little hold-up play from Firmino
[327.56 - 329.96] P:1858.31 E:0.136922 |  Onside Salah is he's going for the center of the goal
[330.20 - 336.92] P:1746.74 E:0.123854 |  Sure has to come over from his left back spot leaves the space in the left back spot that he vacated
[337.36 - 344.24] P:1686.07 E:0.126395 |  For cater cater's going straight down the center of the pitch straight towards a penalty spot and just slides it past the keeper
[344.24 - 347.44] P:1600.18 E:0.135678 |  It's a very good finish. It's an amazing start by Liverpool
[348.56 - 350.56] P:1600.14 E:0.141185 |  Talk about space Dion
[351.36 - 354.64] P:1789.57 E:0.135102 |  Two bases all over the Manchester United to much space yet
[354.64 - 356.36] P:1566.08 E:0.124829 |  But the whole of Manchester United
[356.36 - 361.32] P:1659.90 E:0.143815 |  Defenders over to the right-hand side too close to one the sack of left sure on his own
[361.32 - 364.32] P:1532.09 E:0.138462 |  He had to come over to Salah the lesser to evil
[366.28 - 371.92] P:1579.79 E:0.127371 |  Kater going for the chance on goal, but yet listen tell defending at the back down the left-hand side
[371.92 - 377.28] P:1804.44 E:0.123055 |  Yeah, those lines that you like to draw when you're on match of the day back fours. Yeah, I mean that was it that
[377.60 - 380.36] P:1618.97 E:0.115395 |  Was a squiggle? It was a squiggle? Yes
[380.36 - 384.44] P:1836.66 E:0.141792 |  Yes, and props all over the place and now Liverpool have won the ball centerfield it's a goal scorer Kater
[384.68 - 390.76] P:1864.65 E:0.131065 |  Firmino's in left foot shot save by Deher and then the ball is cleared to the edge of the area where it hits referee Kailor
[390.76 - 393.64] P:1802.30 E:0.119813 |  Who has to stop the play and David Deher?
[393.76 - 397.56] P:1831.32 E:0.131331 |  Well, he was that he was the only man there between Liverpool and a 2-0 lead
[398.40 - 404.60] P:1677.27 E:0.133626 |  Expected Firmino to score as well. He was only eight ten yards out on the angle should have scored he put either side of the
[404.60 - 406.60] P:1637.04 E:0.129173 |  Gay up. I think he would have scored his sort of
[407.28 - 412.52] P:1605.37 E:0.142470 |  At the get Liverpool on the front for every time man United players turn their back to try and receive the ball
[412.52 - 414.52] P:1587.52 E:0.138650 |  There's a Liverpool player there closing them down
[415.12 - 417.64] P:1771.20 E:0.135741 |  Well, what a start here Manchester United nil
[418.20 - 422.96] P:1716.00 E:0.125763 |  Liverpool one Jonathan Agnews got the latest on the cricket. Yeah, we're India have lost their fifth wicket now
[423.32 - 427.56] P:1776.05 E:0.125389 |  They might not get to that 150 we're talking about 132 for five. They've lost to Jager
[427.80 - 430.40] P:1786.26 E:0.125672 |  Cole is still there though on 57 is joined by
[431.00 - 435.88] P:1758.52 E:0.126194 |  Pandia who of course play some big shots, but they're running out of time now ten balls left 132 for five
[436.64 - 441.80] P:1742.46 E:0.126641 |  As I say commentary continues five lives sports extra just like all of the matches
[442.28 - 443.52] P:1556.69 E:0.133375 |  from the
[443.52 - 448.96] P:1719.23 E:0.135521 |  2020 World Cup digital radio BBC sounds for that for Lanka winners earlier against
[449.56 - 451.32] P:1649.00 E:0.124114 |  Bangladesh and
[451.32 - 456.64] P:1695.47 E:0.135633 |  Liverpool winning a three K ten yards inside Manchester United territory who have they've conceded already
[457.04 - 460.04] P:1669.77 E:0.119101 |  Manchester United it is it is quite an issue
[460.72 - 464.36] P:1694.01 E:0.126775 |  this leaky defense that they've got in the absence of
[464.72 - 472.36] P:1718.35 E:0.120850 |  Varan who's out injured still but Salah found space there sore easily in a central position actually came across
[473.20 - 478.64] P:1810.19 E:0.123000 |  Luke Shaw in that position exposed didn't know whether to stick or twist and he just rolled it across to Navi Kater
[478.84 - 483.84] P:1774.95 E:0.116207 |  Kater scored in Madrid now. He scored in Manchester this week. It was
[484.64 - 486.80] P:1714.67 E:0.133862 |  It was avoidable. It really was
[487.68 - 492.64] P:1808.78 E:0.121046 |  Manchester United winning it back Bruno Fernandez had the early chance for United not taken
[493.08 - 495.08] P:1720.39 E:0.132061 |  Liverpool made no mistake with theirs
[495.24 - 502.24] P:1771.21 E:0.140541 |  And here he is Kater who was praised even though he was substituted at half time in that Madrid Salah now running forward freely with the ball
[502.28 - 506.08] P:1818.33 E:0.139949 |  He's got Fred and the Tom and I decided and he goes down for free kick
[506.32 - 510.84] P:1800.36 E:0.139811 |  Jurgen Klopp's wondering why saw the rest of Liverpool certainly their supporters
[510.88 - 515.92] P:1816.11 E:0.136103 |  Here's Cristiano Ronaldo on the left-hand side. Canate comes in and upends him
[517.08 - 522.44] P:1839.73 E:0.134449 |  It goes in takes the ball away from Ronaldo Liverpool played for it Salah on the right-hand side
[522.52 - 528.72] P:1831.97 E:0.124963 |  Jotter wants it in the middle still Salah left foot shot drags it wider than the opposed gold kick Manchester United
[528.80 - 532.04] P:1804.02 E:0.123078 |  What about that from Ibrahim a canate?
[532.64 - 534.28] P:1820.96 E:0.121159 |  Hello Cristiano
[534.28 - 538.92] P:1610.89 E:0.131870 |  Yeah, he seems to take a little bit too long on the ball there Ronaldo and he wanted to play it back
[538.92 - 541.72] P:1720.78 E:0.131430 |  I think he wanted to play it back to shore but he took that second too long
[542.44 - 546.20] P:1677.36 E:0.132116 |  Canate just kicked it out from underneath his feet whether it was a free kick or not
[546.20 - 549.24] P:1644.85 E:0.134918 |  You need a reaction on your loser ball there and then Liverpool go forward again
[549.24 - 552.28] P:1648.69 E:0.118930 |  And could have quite easily scored and made it to because Yotter
[552.92 - 557.04] P:1597.47 E:0.141256 |  Sprinted about 30 40 yards down the center of the pitch to be available for Salah
[557.16 - 560.46] P:1575.98 E:0.120514 |  Salah went for gold, but he had shot her there as well so positive
[560.58 - 565.30] P:1700.63 E:0.133565 |  What a great start big wicket with you Jonathan Agnew indeed Virat Koli is the one Pakistan wanted
[565.30 - 567.34] P:1734.03 E:0.139043 |  They've been really impressive with this I mentioned those 12
[568.02 - 573.42] P:1609.47 E:0.130907 |  Defeats to the hands of India. Well, they've got them now 133 for six with just eight balls left
[574.58 - 579.92] P:1817.55 E:0.117432 |  Thanks Jonathan and it is Saracens 49 wasps 15
[581.58 - 587.34] P:1746.87 E:0.126057 |  Here's Milner playing it forward for Liverpool who lead by one goal to nil
[588.22 - 592.14] P:1736.99 E:0.125343 |  Yeah, Naby Kater, I think he felt I think Jürgen Klopp
[592.90 - 594.90] P:1801.40 E:0.116617 |  Felt that Kater will have
[596.10 - 601.10] P:1805.47 E:0.143750 |  Taken a blow to his morale being substituted the other evening, but he's come up with a goal here
[601.10 - 606.86] P:1833.92 E:0.130024 |  But it is now taken forward by Rashford who shoots from 22 23 yards
[606.86 - 610.02] P:1886.08 E:0.129232 |  He actually got away from Kater there, but called the shot wide
[610.58 - 616.66] P:1802.49 E:0.121590 |  Centrally as it bounce wide by three or four yards. Yes, it's 25 yards out there Marcus Rashford
[616.66 - 620.22] P:1672.66 E:0.126731 |  He's never gonna pass. He did have Bruno Fernandez to his left
[620.82 - 626.54] P:1643.06 E:0.129713 |  When he takes his shot Marcus Rashford Bruno sort of points towards his feet as if to say pay me in
[626.66 - 631.14] P:1665.24 E:0.120123 |  But he's never gonna pass there Marcus promising start this Dion in terms of entertainment
[631.14 - 636.30] P:1784.16 E:0.128893 |  Yeah, really positive Liverpool is very good so far United finding their feet still yeah, and United
[636.30 - 638.62] P:1852.95 E:0.139925 |  Oleg Anasolja said it in his pre-match comments
[639.02 - 643.42] P:1729.47 E:0.107386 |  That he wanted his team to play on the front foot. Well, it means that they
[644.26 - 646.26] P:1676.28 E:0.136779 |  They're on the front foot
[649.94 - 655.58] P:1680.29 E:0.125491 |  They've conceded in their last 13 home matches Manchester United
[656.34 - 658.90] P:1720.29 E:0.134048 |  Last clean sheet they kept here was back in April
[659.82 - 661.54] P:1582.34 E:0.110739 |  Wow
[661.54 - 663.62] P:1635.49 E:0.137879 |  All at the back with Liverpool here is
[664.14 - 666.46] P:1560.74 E:0.124961 |  Virgil van Dijk just turns to his right
[667.22 - 670.90] P:1596.93 E:0.144227 |  Liverpool continued their record of scoring in every game this season
[671.54 - 675.18] P:1578.67 E:0.134370 |  Salah on the far side Salah goes back in towards Ibrahim a
[675.82 - 679.10] P:1640.99 E:0.128538 |  Canate so he plays instead of Matt it who is on the bench
[679.66 - 684.18] P:1672.97 E:0.125899 |  36 million pounds of air about Liverpool played for him in the in the summer
[684.78 - 686.34] P:1766.05 E:0.122488 |  22 years old
[686.34 - 690.98] P:1626.74 E:0.121716 |  So big football in future ahead of him playing as the right-sided central defender
[691.18 - 694.90] P:1660.83 E:0.125580 |  And he's already made an impact with that challenge on Christiano Ronaldo
[694.90 - 696.18] P:1614.23 E:0.123062 |  He's not lacking confidence
[696.18 - 702.14] P:1703.24 E:0.131110 |  He's tried a couple of really difficult passes and Ronaldo's got the ball and he takes it off his foot and that physical element that he has
[702.14 - 705.98] P:1727.17 E:0.120438 |  You can see he's a good 6 4 6 5 and he seems to enjoy it
[707.02 - 712.58] P:1638.90 E:0.131204 |  And I'm not surprised being part of this Liverpool team that is winning here with that early goal from Kater
[712.58 - 718.38] P:1692.66 E:0.121490 |  He has MacTomon a chest the ball down in the center circle Fred had to come across and stretch because it bounced off MacTomon
[718.38 - 720.78] P:1724.59 E:0.125334 |  His chest is Rashford on the left-hand side
[720.78 - 725.82] P:1809.79 E:0.129406 |  He scored in both of his Manchester United appearances this season the England manager Garas Southgate is
[726.18 - 730.06] P:1807.04 E:0.127900 |  Another one of the stars in the directors box to our left your old teammate
[730.42 - 735.50] P:1700.26 E:0.119755 |  He's about 15 yards to our left as we've said spider-man is in there as well
[735.50 - 737.50] P:1573.93 E:0.130614 |  So we've got spider cam and spider-man
[739.06 - 741.06] P:1604.71 E:0.111360 |  Here's Van Dyke
[742.06 - 744.06] P:1695.98 E:0.142514 |  For what it goes to
[744.06 - 750.54] P:1596.01 E:0.131899 |  Henderson Jordan Henderson playing in the Fabinho position and then a flick from Salah out to the right-hand side
[751.14 - 754.50] P:1522.71 E:0.135290 |  Salah who scored in his last nine Liverpool appearances
[754.62 - 758.34] P:1679.21 E:0.123928 |  Which is a new Liverpool record Milne at the left-hand side and
[759.22 - 762.98] P:1765.64 E:0.124654 |  Robertson tried to thread it forward but when the sack of made the block and it's out of play for a throw
[762.98 - 765.38] P:1549.13 E:0.138402 |  Yeah, it seems very comfortable at the moment for Liverpool
[765.38 - 768.62] P:1614.01 E:0.150694 |  I know it's only early what they seem to be getting the ball and that they're able to turn
[769.02 - 773.40] P:1731.57 E:0.122991 |  And that's halfway inside Manchester United's half and needs to be a little bit more intensity
[773.82 - 779.58] P:1714.88 E:0.122337 |  From United don't allow Liverpool to turn make it more difficult for them because at the moment they're picking a pass
[779.90 - 787.44] P:1788.42 E:0.137684 |  Robertson on the left-hand side curls the ball for to the edge of the arm the quiet show come together and Kate and now
[787.46 - 790.42] P:1860.31 E:0.143181 |  Kate on the right-hand side Alexander-Anders ball across it's in
[790.78 - 792.78] P:1833.23 E:0.128719 |  It's to know for Liverpool
[793.30 - 796.82] P:1855.10 E:0.128206 |  And Jota slides it in on the edge of the six-yard box
[797.18 - 803.18] P:1885.40 E:0.126821 |  What a start for Liverpool here at Old Trafford and what a nightmare start for Ali Kona Solchar
[803.18 - 808.82] P:1857.45 E:0.125221 |  Who immediately steps forward to the edge of the coaching area with instructions might already be too late?
[809.42 - 814.38] P:1795.57 E:0.123019 |  Manchester United Nell Liverpool to and they've deserved it. They have been at it today
[814.70 - 820.38] P:1768.77 E:0.122702 |  What is it 13 minutes gone? I can see Olly on the screen in front of a shouting and balling at his players
[820.38 - 822.06] P:1645.66 E:0.133959 |  Liverpool have been sharper
[822.06 - 826.88] P:1759.42 E:0.128351 |  There's been runs going forward when the midfield players have it from Jota and
[827.54 - 832.70] P:1735.33 E:0.132204 |  Kater in there the ball goes wide is about five yards inside the box down the right-hand side
[833.30 - 837.06] P:1737.47 E:0.136294 |  Alexander-Arnold and he's got two to choose from on the far post
[837.54 - 839.94] P:1774.93 E:0.142770 |  Jota's diving in Milner's diving in
[840.98 - 842.50] P:1674.65 E:0.106261 |  Take your pick
[842.50 - 847.14] P:1696.76 E:0.134101 |  If it hadn't been Jota sliding in on his backside, it would have been Milner
[847.86 - 853.46] P:1695.55 E:0.131464 |  I mean this is a decision we're watching the replay the indecision between the captain McGuire and sure
[853.74 - 859.70] P:1579.50 E:0.128188 |  When the balls in between you and your defending one of you deal with it and then ask questions later
[859.70 - 862.82] P:1667.47 E:0.127603 |  Don't leave it for the other player deal with the situation
[863.26 - 866.78] P:1628.68 E:0.110610 |  Honestly, I mean sure and McGuire
[868.06 - 871.18] P:1758.61 E:0.121496 |  So dependable for for England together
[871.46 - 873.86] P:1746.94 E:0.126186 |  Get a self-get as I say watching the two of them
[874.22 - 880.54] P:1789.27 E:0.132824 |  But when the jitters come in football when it gets into your head and it has with Manchester United's defense
[881.26 - 887.60] P:1784.53 E:0.122331 |  That happens when there's one of the oldest shouts in football is early shout sorts it out simple as that
[888.54 - 890.22] P:1769.99 E:0.134632 |  early shout
[890.22 - 892.02] P:1712.37 E:0.108481 |  sorts it out
[892.06 - 894.18] P:1705.82 E:0.124378 |  Bruno Fernandez in the center circle and
[895.06 - 899.22] P:1812.60 E:0.130637 |  Yet again Manchester United have got to come from two nail down just like Wednesday
[899.22 - 902.90] P:1914.45 E:0.129680 |  He has Rashford into the box Rashford still going inside the penalty area, but
[903.66 - 907.46] P:1800.91 E:0.125206 |  Liverpool stand firm Van Dyke and Henderson stand firm
[908.10 - 914.22] P:1709.23 E:0.118898 |  Rashford's dispossessed and Liverpool cleared away downfield this Liverpool team this season mentioned it
[915.30 - 921.34] P:1791.19 E:0.132583 |  Every game this season the fact that they've scored at least three times in every away game this season
[921.38 - 926.44] P:1789.05 E:0.131432 |  And here at all trap at 15 minutes played they've already scored twice every chance. They're going to do it again
[926.44 - 928.44] P:1524.06 E:0.121255 |  Yeah, they look incredibly comfortable
[929.46 - 933.10] P:1677.23 E:0.138240 |  Comfortable confident there in a really nice shape as well
[933.42 - 936.82] P:1645.94 E:0.125635 |  They're in like a like a 451 leaving Firmino
[937.46 - 943.42] P:1773.83 E:0.124241 |  Furthest forward cater dropping into a five Salas dropping into that five as well down the right-hand side
[943.86 - 948.14] P:1839.64 E:0.126984 |  Well, just like in Madrid when Mark Lawrence and was with us on on Tuesday night
[948.18 - 951.54] P:1840.35 E:0.127828 |  I did say in that match when Liverpool took an early two-nil lead
[952.26 - 953.46] P:1865.89 E:0.147300 |  It is still early
[953.46 - 958.70] P:1836.08 E:0.116713 |  There's a lot of time left in this match and the match that we saw then unfolded
[959.02 - 960.02] P:1808.87 E:0.094458 |  but
[960.02 - 966.14] P:1788.87 E:0.119925 |  To nail up here inside all Trafford with less than 15 minutes to play as it was at the time
[966.74 - 972.70] P:1831.41 E:0.121825 |  You're now thinking that this could potentially be a very very damaging result for Oligana Solskjaer
[973.26 - 976.26] P:1850.68 E:0.119088 |  There's plenty of time left for both teams in this match
[976.50 - 979.42] P:1822.10 E:0.122815 |  But Manchester United have won a corner from the left-hand side
[979.70 - 986.02] P:1945.48 E:0.129199 |  Sure with the delivery looking for McGuire with a stretch bounces down the terminate rather sliced his shot and
[986.50 - 992.26] P:1771.96 E:0.114218 |  Sent it spiralling up and over the crossbar under pressure from the defender Alexander-Arnold. Yeah
[993.02 - 995.62] P:1771.39 E:0.119746 |  The next goal has to have to be scored
[995.62 - 1002.58] P:1640.77 E:0.131215 |  It's it's imperative that Manchester United score the next goal in this game. They have to there's pressure there in
[1002.62 - 1008.26] P:1665.13 E:0.138051 |  Itself but man United have to make sure that this doesn't go to three-nil if it does there can't be any way back
[1008.38 - 1009.90] P:1580.17 E:0.110187 |  You know
[1009.90 - 1015.38] P:1592.21 E:0.128659 |  Liverpool have really deserved this lead with a positive start every players on the front foot
[1015.74 - 1018.18] P:1718.59 E:0.126888 |  Every time the United player gets it is under pressure
[1019.02 - 1025.90] P:1686.64 E:0.117825 |  The AR had a look at the Chota goal with the lanes, but I mean with the naked eye could see it was okay
[1025.90 - 1031.94] P:1677.55 E:0.113925 |  Yeah, his arm was outstretched, but with the change for the with the t-shirt line now
[1032.14 - 1038.38] P:1654.59 E:0.120501 |  He was clearly on side and actually that was one I think but you know with it as it is now that little tweak with the naked eye
[1038.38 - 1044.18] P:1634.96 E:0.128738 |  You could say yeah, that's good. Well, they did they did that's exactly what I think the ball from Alexander-Arnold as well
[1044.18 - 1048.94] P:1764.40 E:0.118413 |  He's just inside the box down the right-hand side about eight yards from the touch line
[1048.94 - 1051.34] P:1714.15 E:0.128331 |  And he actually pings it across the goal
[1051.34 - 1056.94] P:1755.14 E:0.128826 |  He has to miss out to many United players to get it to the far post. It's just the concentration on the pass
[1057.18 - 1063.14] P:1692.74 E:0.114758 |  Yeah, click up another assist for Trent Alexander-Arnold for that one
[1064.02 - 1066.18] P:1676.13 E:0.121507 |  Manchester United nil Liverpool 2
[1066.74 - 1069.34] P:1745.80 E:0.126211 |  great start for Liverpool and Klopp and
[1070.26 - 1074.80] P:1799.39 E:0.128137 |  Serious worries for Manchester United Alexander-Arnold Liverpool still on the front foot
[1075.54 - 1080.50] P:1763.57 E:0.120767 |  Salah and Kate any of the edge of the box Kate are chasing it down now towards the dead ball line
[1080.50 - 1084.38] P:1778.52 E:0.122673 |  But it runs away and behind for a goal kick for Manchester United
[1084.38 - 1090.42] P:1675.34 E:0.121087 |  I suppose the only shock is that most Salah's not on the score sheet yet. Yeah, and only 17 minutes in so
[1090.74 - 1092.74] P:1688.70 E:0.114889 |  There's plenty of time for that one
[1092.78 - 1095.54] P:1737.82 E:0.137227 |  Unfortunately for Manchester United. I'm just keeping an eye on
[1096.06 - 1098.94] P:1696.69 E:0.111102 |  Virgil van Dijk the way he's he's talking to his
[1099.74 - 1102.10] P:1699.41 E:0.136450 |  Center half inexperienced center half
[1102.62 - 1105.26] P:1837.77 E:0.142045 |  Manchester United have lost it inside their own penalty area
[1105.26 - 1110.58] P:1806.86 E:0.131766 |  Lindelof tried to play it across and somehow Manchester United have been able to scrape it away clear
[1110.94 - 1116.22] P:1776.96 E:0.128872 |  And now Bruno Fernandez gives it to Juan Bersaca, but there's Milner tigerishly putting in the challenge
[1116.22 - 1118.22] P:1828.37 E:0.131696 |  But good recovery from Juan Bersaca
[1118.70 - 1123.26] P:1858.49 E:0.122183 |  Jota slipped over now Greenwood left-footed ball in that's headed away by Conate
[1123.26 - 1128.78] P:1795.05 E:0.132535 |  Bruno Fernandez gets that first on the edge of the area and then Ronaldo with a shot left side of the box
[1128.78 - 1135.22] P:1797.45 E:0.122231 |  But he got right underneath it and sent it sky high across the face of goal and behind and into the crowd
[1136.22 - 1141.46] P:1684.35 E:0.139875 |  They've got to be hitting the target there, especially someone like Ronaldo. It's just rolled out his 18 yards
[1141.46 - 1145.10] P:1556.95 E:0.127775 |  Maybe 15 yards on the angle. I'm expecting Ronaldo to hit the
[1145.86 - 1148.46] P:1711.75 E:0.121843 |  Hit the target at least can I say he's been busy?
[1148.46 - 1154.30] P:1544.48 E:0.123944 |  I think man United have made it that way on purpose, but he's uh, he's dealt with everything that's been thrown at him physically
[1154.42 - 1159.30] P:1576.91 E:0.112350 |  He's comfortable on the ball van Dijk's been chatting to for the whole of the game. We've got a stoppage now
[1159.30 - 1164.66] P:1591.80 E:0.122046 |  Yeah, Keita has sat down and he's got a problem with well. It looks like his right car
[1165.26 - 1166.62] P:1571.44 E:0.111826 |  if
[1166.62 - 1171.54] P:1702.98 E:0.132128 |  If what we're seeing is anything to go in by because he's using his left hand to rub his left his right cuff
[1172.18 - 1173.58] P:1580.07 E:0.128444 |  so
[1173.58 - 1178.34] P:1729.22 E:0.130604 |  Manchester United nil Liverpool 2 is the score 6-0-6 later with
[1179.02 - 1181.02] P:1699.85 E:0.129328 |  Robbie Savage and Chris Sutton
[1181.66 - 1187.42] P:1586.59 E:0.124556 |  So I'll let you know when the lines are open for that match of the day have passed 10 tonight to see the pictures of this
[1187.62 - 1190.18] P:1704.68 E:0.124963 |  Lester's very good win 2-1 at Brentford to
[1190.70 - 1193.86] P:1723.38 E:0.123592 |  Sound as though they were right in that again Brentford West Ham
[1193.86 - 1196.90] P:1695.86 E:0.125891 |  What a good win 1-0 against Tottenham West Ham up to fourth
[1197.38 - 1199.90] P:1838.49 E:0.133607 |  Rangers three points clear after their 2-1 win at St.
[1199.90 - 1205.02] P:1752.48 E:0.129082 |  Miren Sheffield United 3-2 winners at Barnsley who've lost six league games in a row and
[1205.66 - 1212.06] P:1765.36 E:0.119626 |  Fullham 4-0 up at Nottingham Forest last we heard let's get more from Jonathan Agnew on India Pakistan
[1212.06 - 1217.02] P:1698.60 E:0.133218 |  Yeah, well India got their 150 actually they got to 151 for 7 in fact so Pakistan need a
[1217.58 - 1223.62] P:1775.39 E:0.122281 |  152 to win it's a middling sort of target but lots of pressure on of course particularly in this contest
[1223.66 - 1226.74] P:1754.61 E:0.132271 |  Virat Kohli got 57 Richard Pant 39 and
[1227.22 - 1232.14] P:1804.40 E:0.126015 |  Pandia slogged a few at the end must mention the Shaheen Shahra Friede the left arm quick bowler took 3 for 31
[1232.26 - 1236.34] P:1717.90 E:0.128646 |  His four overs involved very well now the pressure on Pakistan 152 to win
[1236.66 - 1239.94] P:1757.56 E:0.127472 |  Thank You Jonathan and it's all over with you Ian Carter in the premonition
[1239.94 - 1247.50] P:1619.64 E:0.133590 |  It is indeed the expected convincing win for Saracens rounded off by their eighth try coming from Ben Earl in the final move of the match
[1247.70 - 1249.70] P:1740.55 E:0.133479 |  converted by Owen Farrell

[1286.90 - 1294.14] P:1908.15 E:0.125979 |  Liverpool's defensive third, but it's all rather ponderous. I'm afraid but United sure crossing easy stooping head out by
[1294.58 - 1300.88] P:1838.25 E:0.127809 |  Canate just dropped to his knees no challenge then Ronaldo Greenwood back to McTomon air 30 yards out

[1328.58 - 1330.58] P:1861.75 E:0.134473 |  Yeah, it was he wasn't a bad striker tall
[1330.58 - 1336.50] P:1786.44 E:0.120674 |  He wasn't far from the corner of the box there trying to strike across Allison there into that far corner a
[1336.94 - 1338.54] P:1722.86 E:0.110397 |  Couple of yards away
[1338.54 - 1342.50] P:1798.55 E:0.127285 |  But he was kind of forced into it sure fans are getting all uptight
[1342.50 - 1346.50] P:1685.53 E:0.133433 |  I can just see the view here on the screens is about a yard away
[1347.14 - 1349.14] P:1689.48 E:0.123899 |  Allison had it covered actually all the way
[1350.10 - 1355.78] P:1813.39 E:0.110263 |  Final score is Nottingham Forest nil full of four so that excellent winning run of
[1356.58 - 1359.06] P:1798.30 E:0.148043 |  Nottingham Forest now well and truly all back
[1359.70 - 1363.74] P:1734.45 E:0.120122 |  And an important and a very good win for full of as well at the towards the top end of the table
[1364.22 - 1371.38] P:1745.31 E:0.131568 |  Manchester United nil Liverpool to here in the Premier League and Lindelof going back to goalkeeper to here
[1372.10 - 1373.34] P:1844.26 E:0.095956 |  but
[1373.34 - 1380.86] P:1802.16 E:0.123326 |  I mean the jitters there in that Manchester United defense are there to see virtually every time it gets an into the United
[1380.86 - 1387.62] P:1676.64 E:0.119074 |  Defensive third. Yeah, it does the indecision and the lack of chat as well from the back four is terrible at the moment from Manchester United
[1387.74 - 1393.62] P:1722.56 E:0.127086 |  We had a stoppage there when Kater was holding his car and all I was looking at is Jordan Henderson talking to people
[1393.74 - 1396.66] P:1639.80 E:0.134107 |  It was Miller talking to his teammates. They were organizing
[1397.74 - 1402.70] P:1795.15 E:0.126565 |  Kater's okay by the way Salah gives it to Firmino down the right-hand side Firmino
[1403.42 - 1405.30] P:1689.19 E:0.096347 |  played in his
[1405.30 - 1408.62] P:1735.15 E:0.123076 |  300th match for Liverpool during the week in Madrid
[1409.38 - 1411.38] P:1669.52 E:0.106092 |  And then Alexander-Arnold
[1411.46 - 1413.30] P:1569.46 E:0.104397 |  centrally to Henderson
[1413.30 - 1416.26] P:1741.50 E:0.143970 |  Liverpool so much crisper it seems than Manchester United
[1416.50 - 1420.58] P:1609.09 E:0.130381 |  Of course, they've got the confidence of a 2-0 lead here at Old Trafford
[1421.30 - 1423.30] P:1782.96 E:0.135304 |  One for two last season
[1423.46 - 1431.18] P:1806.04 E:0.134535 |  That was Jurgen Klopp's first win at Old Trafford as the Liverpool manager a slip from Milner and Ronaldo's under this down the right-hand side
[1431.18 - 1435.30] P:1869.57 E:0.118806 |  He chips it across but he chips it under the head of Canate who heads it away for Liverpool
[1435.86 - 1438.38] P:1756.48 E:0.127113 |  McTomonay then back out to the left-hand side Milner's got a problem
[1438.86 - 1442.66] P:1754.09 E:0.112360 |  Milner's hobbling after that slip and he's indicated it to the bench
[1442.86 - 1444.98] P:1859.72 E:0.118038 |  But sure now down the left-hand side
[1444.98 - 1449.10] P:1836.99 E:0.129760 |  But no one there on the edge of the box from Manchester United easy header away for Jota
[1449.62 - 1451.62] P:1801.97 E:0.142284 |  McTomonay has to slide in on Salah
[1451.98 - 1455.94] P:1715.30 E:0.119259 |  And the Liverpool medical it looks like a hamstring for Milner Liverpool
[1456.46 - 1463.70] P:1737.16 E:0.130287 |  Defending ball whipped in from the left-hand side but through to Allison and Milner has sat down on the edge of the D and
[1464.34 - 1466.98] P:1748.38 E:0.129942 |  Anthony Taylor waves on the medical people
[1467.94 - 1469.54] P:1722.39 E:0.141145 |  That look like a hamstring didn't it?
[1469.54 - 1471.22] P:1656.43 E:0.142416 |  He was holding his left hamstring there
[1471.22 - 1475.38] P:1594.93 E:0.127796 |  He had to he actually slipped over before the ball went in behind him
[1475.42 - 1479.06] P:1618.43 E:0.123065 |  And then Ronaldo got on the end of it and as he was trying to catch up with Ronaldo
[1479.58 - 1485.26] P:1627.39 E:0.135470 |  Like most players trying to catch up with Ronaldo you do a hamstring because he was going that quickly. So yeah, particularly when you're 35
[1485.70 - 1489.02] P:1481.95 E:0.131056 |  Absolutely, thank you. Of course, Ronaldo's 36
[1489.86 - 1494.42] P:1696.26 E:0.132876 |  But but Milner as I said to you Dion, this is his fifth consecutive start
[1495.22 - 1502.78] P:1710.48 E:0.127967 |  Maybe maybe one too many and so that means with no Fabinho that Curtis Jones has got to very quickly get himself ready here
[1502.78 - 1509.50] P:1767.50 E:0.125069 |  I saw Jürgen Klopp sending him out to to get warmed up only just coming back from an injury problem that he had
[1510.18 - 1512.78] P:1727.75 E:0.125942 |  on England under 21 duty and
[1514.58 - 1520.38] P:1816.80 E:0.131347 |  Maybe not absolutely ideal for him to get involved in the match this early, but if he's on the bench, he'll be fit
[1520.86 - 1526.14] P:1556.26 E:0.137053 |  Yeah, and he's a very very good player as well. You'll come in. It won't be a problem for him whatsoever
[1526.42 - 1532.18] P:1647.50 E:0.128149 |  Jones and enjoy the challenge Milner just getting pulled up off the turf now by the physio
[1533.26 - 1535.26] P:1643.70 E:0.138918 |  hobbling slightly as well
[1535.42 - 1539.14] P:1550.98 E:0.138369 |  But he'll want to carry on but there's no chance by the way he's walking
[1541.22 - 1546.02] P:1596.12 E:0.140016 |  No looking back at the goals actually on the screen that became his goal was so comfortable one-on-one
[1546.38 - 1548.78] P:1685.58 E:0.121445 |  It really was indecision sure
[1548.78 - 1550.78] P:1461.30 E:0.080769 |  I
[1550.94 - 1557.38] P:1678.47 E:0.137509 |  Maguire and then we see the second goal with Trent Alexander just sticking it in that corridor of uncertainty in Diego Jota's there
[1558.10 - 1560.98] P:1650.67 E:0.133499 |  Liverpool have dominated this first off
[1561.78 - 1566.38] P:1713.15 E:0.137401 |  So now be cater with his third goal of the season Jota with his fourth
[1567.10 - 1571.44] P:1731.41 E:0.133066 |  Liverpool 2-0 up but having to make a change now here in the 26th minute
[1571.78 - 1575.34] P:1610.73 E:0.127828 |  James Milner is walking off the field very very slowly and
[1576.30 - 1577.82] P:1584.11 E:0.137143 |  Curtis Jones
[1577.82 - 1579.82] P:1586.02 E:0.135152 |  Is making his comeback
[1580.22 - 1581.58] P:1559.12 E:0.131448 |  having
[1581.58 - 1585.34] P:1766.54 E:0.126826 |  Started for in a role in the Liverpool team remember before he was injured
[1585.98 - 1588.34] P:1569.73 E:0.124511 |  in the in the under 21 match
[1589.90 - 1594.50] P:1668.53 E:0.137112 |  So off he comes having missed the last couple of Liverpool matches Curtis Jones on into the midfield
[1595.22 - 1597.62] P:1687.23 E:0.136790 |  Manchester United nil Liverpool to
[1598.42 - 1601.06] P:1757.07 E:0.136171 |  BBC Radio 5 live live from old traffic
[1601.06 - 1604.82] P:1590.87 E:0.131629 |  I think they might be going to get another rain shower again. It seems to have darkened
[1605.18 - 1610.98] P:1660.00 E:0.127042 |  Floodlights have taken greater effect and now here's Alexander Arnold on the right-hand side who is charged down by
[1611.54 - 1617.74] P:1633.08 E:0.130936 |  Rashford and the ball bouncing around in the first few rows of the set Alex Ferguson stand on the far side of the ground
[1619.02 - 1620.42] P:1683.60 E:0.136414 |  Liverpool's throw
[1620.42 - 1623.66] P:1713.53 E:0.133703 |  It's been quite a shock from Manchester United. I say a shock
[1624.06 - 1626.86] P:1534.12 E:0.127633 |  It's not like this sort of thing hasn't happened to them before in fact
[1626.86 - 1631.70] P:1839.43 E:0.123558 |  It's already happened this week to nail down here at Old Trafford dreamwood for Manchester United
[1631.70 - 1636.30] P:1761.99 E:0.127663 |  Greenwood up to the edge of the penalty area United winning it back from what was a Liverpool throw on the halfway line
[1636.42 - 1641.36] P:1846.87 E:0.124323 |  Greenwood then curling it out to the left-hand side Rashford takes it down Bruno Fernandez is there as well
[1641.36 - 1644.94] P:1751.52 E:0.119434 |  Bruno Fernandez cross hits the backside of Kata and bounces away and
[1645.98 - 1647.98] P:1749.11 E:0.105712 |  Rashford had to be sharp there to get
[1648.10 - 1652.46] P:1708.59 E:0.114123 |  Get there first ahead of Salah, but he was Bruno Fernandez now back to
[1653.10 - 1655.30] P:1686.60 E:0.132411 |  Rashford and the Manchester United number 10
[1655.98 - 1660.70] P:1692.39 E:0.136174 |  Only just recently back after that shoulder operation that he had following the Euros
[1661.06 - 1667.42] P:1778.24 E:0.129249 |  Fred now through to Rashford but Rashford incomes a little challenge from Kata has done really well in there as well as scoring his goal
[1667.42 - 1672.98] P:1663.29 E:0.119901 |  He's been a real presence in central midfield the Guinea international and the touch from him took it back to Allison
[1672.98 - 1677.62] P:1670.22 E:0.133010 |  Yeah, I need a bit more movement up front for Manchester United when Tom and a's got it Fred's got it
[1677.62 - 1678.66] P:1662.08 E:0.142034 |  They're in a line
[1678.66 - 1684.02] P:1605.54 E:0.124236 |  They're in a line with the Liverpool line. There's nobody dropping into that hole Bruno Fernandez needs to get into that hole
[1684.02 - 1688.86] P:1619.15 E:0.133504 |  He'd see more movement from Rashford on the left-hand side as well and Greenwood on the right-hand side
[1689.26 - 1693.10] P:1787.63 E:0.135478 |  That of course is Deon Dublin with us on five life and the World Service
[1693.62 - 1695.62] P:1536.97 E:0.096899 |  Golden boot winner and
[1695.90 - 1700.70] P:1675.47 E:0.135748 |  Like Salah and Manet a member of the Premier League 100 goals club
[1700.94 - 1707.74] P:1847.03 E:0.133163 |  And here is Rashford on the left-hand side Rashford now red shirts pouring forward for Manchester United
[1707.74 - 1711.34] P:1811.14 E:0.115404 |  But Rashford couldn't find the pass deflected back to Fred back. It goes to
[1711.94 - 1713.94] P:1833.40 E:0.112375 |  Rashford turns on to his left foot
[1713.94 - 1720.44] P:1766.31 E:0.122582 |  Alexander Arnold up against him and then cater arrived so back it goes towards Fred more centrally middle of the Liverpool half
[1721.14 - 1725.38] P:1692.79 E:0.120203 |  Mekotomani now to the right-hand side to one Bersaka one Bersaka being
[1726.34 - 1727.50] P:1782.44 E:0.128845 |  patrolled by
[1727.50 - 1733.02] P:1846.48 E:0.126152 |  Jota Greenwood drops the shoulder should and Allison took a deflection actually
[1733.30 - 1739.10] P:1860.57 E:0.133612 |  Allison diving to his right got a good sight of it good height for it as well and pushed it away and wide and behind from
[1739.14 - 1743.26] P:1685.82 E:0.133526 |  Manchester United yeah, that's his area there Greenwood corner of the box down the right-hand side
[1743.82 - 1748.30] P:1654.19 E:0.126620 |  Shifts it from his right foot to his left tries to put in that far corner good saving the end from Allison
[1749.62 - 1751.46] P:1516.81 E:0.102457 |  Greenwood
[1751.46 - 1755.10] P:1812.37 E:0.132129 |  Takes up a position show with the corner here it is towards the penalty spot
[1755.10 - 1761.14] P:1765.10 E:0.125831 |  That's headed away comes out for Manchester United for the nodded ball forward from Lindelof Kater was behind that
[1761.58 - 1766.46] P:1743.10 E:0.129372 |  But Manchester United are able to take up possession again in the center third in the field
[1767.34 - 1774.02] P:1783.95 E:0.127976 |  More jitters on the halfway line Liverpool win it back and then over the halfway line they go
[1774.34 - 1779.10] P:1664.71 E:0.109649 |  Jota Curtis Jones almost all alone in the center circle had a look over his shoulder
[1779.10 - 1784.02] P:1671.50 E:0.114024 |  There was no one coming and actually just slows slows the play down almost half an hour played
[1784.42 - 1788.50] P:1612.34 E:0.122902 |  And Jurgen Klopp and Liverpool have got Manchester United
[1789.26 - 1791.26] P:1458.23 E:0.121087 |  exactly where they want them
[1791.42 - 1794.50] P:1567.62 E:0.123490 |  Kater on the right-hand side up to Firmino
[1795.50 - 1796.90] P:1785.78 E:0.126921 |  Firmino
[1796.90 - 1803.94] P:1843.33 E:0.134804 |  Turns moves in field Jota on the edge of the day takes a touch double touch then to the left-hand side Alexander Arnold's there plays it right across
[1803.94 - 1806.98] P:1889.89 E:0.120075 |  The six-yard box United half clear the ball loops up
[1807.26 - 1813.86] P:1864.36 E:0.128585 |  Mekton may nods it away headed it straight to Liverpool now Henderson's going to have a goal which he does and sweeps the shot via a deflection
[1814.42 - 1818.82] P:1692.50 E:0.127337 |  Wide of the left post as he looked at it and behind and Liverpool have a corner for that
[1818.82 - 1822.58] P:1532.74 E:0.139668 |  Yeah, Liverpool are being very clever. They're holding the ball
[1823.18 - 1825.18] P:1712.47 E:0.123985 |  Back forward just playing from left to right
[1826.30 - 1831.90] P:1703.53 E:0.137505 |  Forcing one of the man United players to come out to squeeze them because man United have to and then they're just using the space
[1831.90 - 1838.62] P:1653.32 E:0.134277 |  It's been vacated by that player in lead being very very clever very well managed this side managing the game
[1838.62 - 1842.22] P:1677.56 E:0.123188 |  Well as well Liverpool. Yeah, they look what they are a team in prime form
[1843.46 - 1846.42] P:1734.39 E:0.138988 |  Alexander Arnold with the corner then for them towards the back post
[1846.54 - 1852.10] P:1838.69 E:0.124339 |  That's headed away on the edge of the six-yard box play lindel off fired back into the back post Firmino couldn't get a touch
[1853.58 - 1859.74] P:1718.88 E:0.121490 |  Bruna Fernandez was in there as well, but I think it went past both of them and through for what is given as a goal
[1859.74 - 1865.30] P:1714.33 E:0.139000 |  Yeah, we can just feel that frustration now can hear the frustration as well from the man United
[1865.58 - 1871.14] P:1735.12 E:0.122735 |  Fans get the ball forward be more positive. That's the feeling I'm getting sat here from the fans
[1871.26 - 1878.82] P:1712.14 E:0.127873 |  Yeah, it's a it's an unsettled sound isn't it that's coming down from the stands of old Trafford over 70,000 people here
[1880.14 - 1881.50] P:1752.21 E:0.119008 |  United have
[1881.54 - 1887.02] P:1711.81 E:0.116116 |  Simply just got to try and find a way back into this game a goal before half time
[1887.42 - 1894.22] P:1707.75 E:0.125212 |  Would be just what they want, but it's a sound of satisfaction coming from the Liverpool supporters in their section to our right
[1894.98 - 1900.98] P:1694.75 E:0.122888 |  They can be they can be they can have every confidence that their team in this form can see this through
[1900.98 - 1903.42] P:1827.65 E:0.132045 |  There's an upside flag up against Manchester United
[1903.42 - 1907.14] P:1881.77 E:0.129370 |  But it's bounce forward for Liverpool and Salah's in here and Salah shot his block by to here
[1907.14 - 1909.58] P:1858.80 E:0.126493 |  The angle was very very tight mind you
[1910.10 - 1913.86] P:1789.83 E:0.119396 |  That doesn't necessarily put Salah off and here still had to make the same
[1913.86 - 1917.22] P:1821.38 E:0.150901 |  Yeah, he was actually down that side that we know he likes
[1917.50 - 1923.96] P:1819.54 E:0.129014 |  Canate with the challenge on Rashford who's left down on the ground home supporters feel that was a foul by Canate on on Rashford
[1924.10 - 1928.14] P:1672.02 E:0.126524 |  Referee Taylor says no it wasn't I think these man United players know that canate is playing today
[1928.14 - 1930.90] P:1659.31 E:0.139851 |  Doesn't like the physical side of the game doesn't mind it at all
[1931.34 - 1936.82] P:1680.09 E:0.131293 |  Letting those man United players know come my side you think he might be easy this side because there's over there you're wrong
[1937.10 - 1939.70] P:1524.42 E:0.127697 |  I'm up for this game. That's what he's saying and so a Liverpool
[1939.74 - 1944.82] P:1737.02 E:0.123797 |  Well, he's had a very good game so far and now Liverpool again Jotter in the middle stretching
[1944.82 - 1950.46] P:1754.83 E:0.130330 |  But couldn't get there and the ball runs across the box into here's a little bit to get to it and just feel that like a back pass
[1950.46 - 1956.42] P:1687.94 E:0.127280 |  Yeah, that doesn't seem to be any relaxed defending from Manchester United. Everything's lost everything's the last bitch
[1956.94 - 1960.54] P:1742.15 E:0.129982 |  They're forcing the game out to kick the ball forward the fans and now he's giving it away
[1961.30 - 1963.30] P:1635.09 E:0.099261 |  But they're better than this
[1963.54 - 1970.02] P:1803.06 E:0.134137 |  They are better than this this Manchester United back lane we know we've seen them this this this back lane is very very familiar
[1970.14 - 1975.62] P:1678.92 E:0.127539 |  Yeah, yeah, it is it is and we've seen it play many many times and play very very well many times
[1975.82 - 1980.40] P:1743.60 E:0.126748 |  The thing about it is when you're in an atmosphere like this and you're playing for a big club like Manchester United
[1980.40 - 1982.70] P:1747.18 E:0.125067 |  You need those players on the pitch to calm things down
[1983.70 - 1985.70] P:1802.35 E:0.137358 |  Rashford in an offside position
[1986.18 - 1989.18] P:1727.35 E:0.134510 |  As McGuire hit the long ball downfield for him
[1989.90 - 1993.10] P:1747.64 E:0.117906 |  And Liverpool with a free kick half way inside their own territory
[1993.94 - 1995.46] P:1597.79 E:0.105208 |  Manchester United nil
[1995.46 - 1997.94] P:1663.31 E:0.125742 |  Liverpool to half-time approaching
[1998.42 - 2001.02] P:1864.92 E:0.131312 |  Just over 10 minutes away. We're gonna hear from David Moyes
[2001.70 - 2004.82] P:1690.51 E:0.114878 |  the former Manchester United manager who is
[2005.46 - 2007.46] P:1853.46 E:0.131677 |  enjoying another very good season
[2008.30 - 2010.30] P:1626.49 E:0.113819 |  still early days with
[2010.62 - 2013.14] P:1479.64 E:0.120439 |  With West Ham this season, but what a good win for them
[2013.74 - 2018.58] P:1702.78 E:0.119544 |  Disappointing defeat for Tottenham and we will also hear from the Leicester camp as well
[2018.58 - 2022.66] P:1707.43 E:0.126090 |  James Madison is going to be talking to us after he scored the the second goal for Leicester
[2023.38 - 2027.94] P:1671.87 E:0.130238 |  In their win at Brenford Leicester on 14 points the same as Manchester United
[2028.38 - 2033.14] P:1739.48 E:0.133599 |  United losing at Leicester last weekend conceded bad goals in that match as well as you'll know
[2033.62 - 2036.30] P:1722.54 E:0.133641 |  Greenwood now for Manchester United who win possession back
[2036.30 - 2039.66] P:1704.56 E:0.136984 |  Here's the ball in from Bruno Fernandez to the back post Ronaldo was underneath it
[2039.78 - 2043.02] P:1869.36 E:0.133001 |  Robertson just jumping got his head to it first
[2043.22 - 2046.38] P:1866.39 E:0.124252 |  Ahead of the great Portuguese and Glans stood behind for corner
[2047.02 - 2049.02] P:1782.98 E:0.120594 |  Just enough just good enough
[2049.38 - 2055.42] P:1743.45 E:0.138403 |  Robertson down the far post and now they were zooning that little diagonal run Bruno had the ball diagonal run diagonal ball
[2055.58 - 2057.58] P:1789.22 E:0.099059 |  Robertson flicks it out for corner
[2057.74 - 2061.30] P:1792.96 E:0.123367 |  Short to take this one from the right-hand side first one they've had from this side
[2061.30 - 2063.58] P:1700.24 E:0.109669 |  So it's the in swing at and the England left back
[2063.86 - 2067.66] P:1765.37 E:0.129195 |  Liverpool fans up there behind him plays it in rattles around on the edge of the six yard box
[2067.70 - 2073.56] P:1878.48 E:0.126682 |  Still not cleared McGuire heads at four another head stretch then the ball bounces down Rashford's in there comes out for sure
[2073.78 - 2076.62] P:1837.43 E:0.134858 |  showing on the challenge clattered together with
[2077.26 - 2083.58] P:1840.90 E:0.118953 |  Who kept his feet sure went down short claims for a corner referee Taylor says goal kick Liverpool
[2083.58 - 2087.10] P:1573.67 E:0.119991 |  Yeah, I think he gets it right as well having seen the replay a couple of times
[2087.10 - 2091.02] P:1599.91 E:0.131372 |  Sure's got his arms out running towards ref as if to say you've got that one wrong
[2091.02 - 2094.82] P:1626.43 E:0.116429 |  But I think he was gonna just flick it off Kater's legs and Katie moved out the way
[2095.46 - 2097.46] P:1718.14 E:0.128304 |  So it's 2-0 to Liverpool
[2098.10 - 2102.70] P:1699.96 E:0.125984 |  Liverpool last season that 4-2 win that was the first win for Liverpool and
[2103.34 - 2107.86] P:1727.15 E:0.131956 |  Jürgen Klopp here at Old Trafford Manchester United had won in the FA Cup last season
[2107.86 - 2109.86] P:1696.26 E:0.122318 |  That was a good game. I remember that and
[2110.82 - 2114.06] P:1871.87 E:0.130029 |  And they were pretty much full strength teams that played in the FA Cup tie
[2114.22 - 2120.46] P:1778.73 E:0.112408 |  But Oligo Nassosha yet to win a league match against Liverpool as a manager in six matches
[2120.46 - 2125.18] P:1680.97 E:0.125317 |  And if he gets a win out of this one, then I think the reaction will be even greater
[2125.18 - 2127.90] P:1661.34 E:0.132566 |  Then it was in the week when they came back to beat Atlanta
[2128.26 - 2133.42] P:1735.02 E:0.123943 |  Fred playing the ball through but too much on that Rashford couldn't get onto it through the middle and Liverpool coming through
[2133.82 - 2137.46] P:1763.80 E:0.135037 |  Bringing it out from the back again themselves, but Kate or is dispossessed and now
[2137.46 - 2141.34] P:1735.34 E:0.136203 |  McTominay allows it to run to Bruno Fernandez his past slightly behind
[2141.78 - 2144.54] P:1758.85 E:0.116617 |  Ronaldo and therefore he had to check back
[2145.10 - 2147.10] P:1812.62 E:0.119633 |  Ronaldo still in possession on the left-hand side
[2147.46 - 2149.12] P:1657.54 E:0.108787 |  Then back to Shaw
[2149.12 - 2154.30] P:1841.02 E:0.132406 |  Shaw into Bruno Fernandez first time volley into the area Rashford with a shot as it dropped over his shoulder
[2154.62 - 2158.58] P:1849.27 E:0.115318 |  Went for the spectacular and miss hit it really straight through to Allison
[2158.58 - 2162.14] P:1511.76 E:0.144763 |  Yeah, lovely little bit of play Ronaldo to Bruno and Bruno puts in
[2163.06 - 2166.38] P:1887.10 E:0.144164 |  Rashford he tries to take it first time it's coming over his right shoulder tries to volley it
[2167.30 - 2171.22] P:1689.70 E:0.123275 |  Which is the right thing to do because if he lets it bounce Van Dyke's there to clear it
[2173.34 - 2177.70] P:1592.34 E:0.114068 |  To know Liverpool League Liverpool coming forward again, it's
[2178.10 - 2184.58] P:1740.13 E:0.119142 |  Not while it's not been absolutely end-to-end all the time it's had plenty of that
[2185.50 - 2187.50] P:1768.22 E:0.119958 |  Van Dyke just forward of the center circle
[2188.22 - 2193.66] P:1608.36 E:0.126794 |  Uses the Scotland captain Robertson here on the left-hand side then and back it goes towards the halfway line
[2195.22 - 2201.30] P:1530.63 E:0.133736 |  Canate now John that it is among the substitutes and no Quavine Kellehab by the way either we
[2201.70 - 2205.14] P:1577.47 E:0.128055 |  Discovered before kickoff that he's been unwell this week
[2205.14 - 2209.50] P:1641.77 E:0.126334 |  So Adrienne is on the substitutes bench the goalkeeper for Liverpool
[2210.90 - 2214.98] P:1729.34 E:0.121102 |  His Curtis Jones turning on to his right foot to give it to Robertson
[2215.38 - 2221.86] P:1606.46 E:0.110114 |  Jürgen Klopp all in back black apart from that big red kick on the back of his coat
[2222.18 - 2225.78] P:1702.05 E:0.126414 |  Those big white shoes on again with the red stripes and the red laces
[2226.62 - 2228.46] P:1474.82 E:0.114520 |  Here's Henderson
[2228.54 - 2233.02] P:1527.93 E:0.140142 |  Henderson and Liverpool keeping possession they like this those supporters to our right
[2233.74 - 2236.70] P:1670.55 E:0.129947 |  Liverpool bossing it at Old Trafford
[2237.50 - 2239.50] P:1670.70 E:0.141144 |  And then back it goes to canate
[2240.02 - 2245.56] P:1697.19 E:0.130161 |  Mike feelings the man from Manchester United on the edge of the coaching area both played through the middle stretch to his left from
[2245.56 - 2247.56] P:1592.56 E:0.111710 |  Lindelof intercepts that pass
[2248.50 - 2252.78] P:1595.32 E:0.135119 |  But all Manchester United do is give it back to Liverpool on the halfway line
[2253.34 - 2258.06] P:1606.60 E:0.129577 |  Henderson now to Keita Keita who started the ball rolling with the opening goal
[2258.46 - 2264.18] P:1792.27 E:0.124765 |  Now for Mino this is lovely from Liverpool then jot out Salah with a snapshot that's deflected across the box now
[2264.18 - 2268.86] P:1865.68 E:0.132328 |  It's across it's another one. It's Salah this time. It's three nil
[2269.46 - 2275.58] P:1861.05 E:0.128172 |  Salah scores for a tense consecutive match and Liverpool are all over Manchester United
[2275.98 - 2282.98] P:1813.51 E:0.124056 |  Here at Old Trafford Oleg on a soft shot down there just stays in his seat and it's Manchester United nil
[2283.58 - 2285.58] P:1686.85 E:0.107544 |  Liverpool three
[2285.58 - 2288.14] P:1738.18 E:0.127804 |  And when nowhere near half-time even yet
[2288.94 - 2290.94] P:1615.93 E:0.131592 |  That is an incredible
[2291.46 - 2296.98] P:1671.68 E:0.131219 |  That is an incredible passage of football there from Liverpool one tunes
[2297.54 - 2304.14] P:1700.44 E:0.138849 |  Flicks round the corners little round the corner watching the replay here for Mino and Salah into Jota
[2304.14 - 2306.70] P:1693.67 E:0.115662 |  And then ricochet is out to Keita
[2306.94 - 2313.58] P:1720.01 E:0.127407 |  The thing that I noticed there is that most Salah is being marked by McGuire and sure
[2313.70 - 2320.54] P:1756.32 E:0.129607 |  The ball ricochets out wide to Keita Salah goes by those two defenders and wants to get there first
[2320.54 - 2327.66] P:1717.32 E:0.127225 |  He does he scores deserves to score Liverpool have been outstanding man United aren't even out on the pitch yet
[2328.82 - 2330.82] P:1699.78 E:0.125508 |  Manchester United nil
[2331.22 - 2333.22] P:1637.23 E:0.129346 |  Liverpool three
[2333.70 - 2335.06] P:1617.98 E:0.127927 |  three nil
[2335.06 - 2337.06] P:1731.35 E:0.124788 |  to your fiercest rivals
[2338.30 - 2340.30] P:1736.26 E:0.128913 |  On your home tour
[2341.06 - 2344.30] P:1712.02 E:0.130163 |  And surely even though we've got
[2345.18 - 2347.18] P:1651.37 E:0.129022 |  Well over half of the match to play
[2348.18 - 2350.66] P:1723.06 E:0.133129 |  Surely this is too much to come back for this
[2351.62 - 2358.02] P:1639.35 E:0.120153 |  Even with some of the power that Manchester United have got out there because it's just not clicking for them and
[2358.54 - 2360.34] P:1781.12 E:0.123167 |  Of course yet again
[2360.34 - 2367.86] P:1635.23 E:0.127735 |  Liverpool have maintained their record of scoring at least three goals in every away match this season
[2367.98 - 2372.62] P:1552.31 E:0.131770 |  I mean to do it in the metropolitan and all-trafford in the same week
[2373.10 - 2377.38] P:1494.54 E:0.134054 |  Against the Spanish champions and Manchester United that's some going and they haven't they haven't just
[2377.94 - 2383.38] P:1620.86 E:0.141985 |  Just nick these goals in this first off. They haven't just not been ricochets or mistakes. They've been well-worked goals
[2386.26 - 2388.76] P:1775.27 E:0.155645 |  Real Madrid are two nil up on Barcelona
[2389.34 - 2395.70] P:1713.44 E:0.128245 |  In the in the big game in Spain today Barcelona nil Real Madrid to and Lucas Vasquez with the second goal
[2395.98 - 2402.18] P:1663.03 E:0.134704 |  For Carlo Ancelotti's side so Barcelona's walls continue little Manchester United plate forward
[2402.18 - 2406.42] P:1767.86 E:0.137883 |  But up Ronaldo was in an offside position that was
[2407.06 - 2408.66] P:1750.28 E:0.116940 |  So clear
[2408.66 - 2410.66] P:1737.74 E:0.127655 |  Even the assistant put the flag up
[2412.38 - 2418.98] P:1608.91 E:0.119646 |  I mean the organization of that back four at the moment for Liverpool is just it's outstanding the pace
[2419.70 - 2420.90] P:1545.48 E:0.168072 |  Wow
[2420.90 - 2426.02] P:1728.39 E:0.133771 |  Salah was pulled back there by sure he was away from him and that's going to be a yellow card for sure it is
[2426.50 - 2431.46] P:1706.37 E:0.121514 |  Salah was away just a blatant took back by the England left back shouldn't be that easy John
[2431.46 - 2435.18] P:1647.36 E:0.134861 |  It shouldn't be that easy the balls rolled into Salah is on the right wing ten yards inside
[2435.66 - 2440.70] P:1661.92 E:0.118619 |  Manchester United's half he lets the ball roll through his legs and sure is so upright
[2440.70 - 2444.78] P:1618.13 E:0.127713 |  He can't see where the ball is so he has to pull Salah back because he's done it with a bit of skill
[2445.22 - 2449.30] P:1654.73 E:0.129509 |  This was on the right wing about 15 yards inside the Manchester United half
[2449.58 - 2454.22] P:1695.06 E:0.130203 |  But Salah's caused real problems for Manchester United by coming centrally so much
[2454.22 - 2457.70] P:1717.87 E:0.130987 |  He's been involved in the build up to two of the goals in a central position
[2458.06 - 2464.74] P:1684.15 E:0.132555 |  And as Dion said when the ball was played by Salah it hit McGuire bounce to Keita right side of the area
[2464.86 - 2466.86] P:1794.95 E:0.125469 |  But Salah's reaction was so quick
[2466.98 - 2474.02] P:1759.16 E:0.111192 |  He just he just got there on the edge of the six yard box and in that position when it came across low from Keita flash
[2474.82 - 2476.42] P:1442.62 E:0.099019 |  And into the back of the net
[2476.42 - 2480.34] P:1634.34 E:0.133786 |  Yeah, that's all the players you want it to fault it to Salah. It was just
[2480.82 - 2483.74] P:1729.13 E:0.123318 |  Not so much to finish not so much the ball from Keita
[2483.74 - 2488.66] P:1705.19 E:0.125578 |  It was just the desire from Mo Salah to get past because sure try to pull his shirt
[2489.06 - 2490.34] P:1578.79 E:0.127037 |  To try and get him back
[2490.34 - 2496.62] P:1642.57 E:0.129233 |  But Salah just shook them both off got into a dangerous area and hope the ball will come just that desire to score goals
[2496.74 - 2499.22] P:1675.83 E:0.121694 |  It shows that's why he scored so many goals
[2499.82 - 2503.84] P:1625.46 E:0.131408 |  This is a story Dion is met this school in Manchester United nil
[2504.60 - 2506.36] P:1639.60 E:0.121841 |  Liverpool 3
[2506.36 - 2514.36] P:1777.96 E:0.127407 |  Barcelona have got a very late goal back against Real Madrid Sergio Acuero has scored and the seventh minute of added time so Barcelona 1
[2515.76 - 2519.42] P:1652.76 E:0.114992 |  Real Madrid 2 and I think they're still playing
[2520.16 - 2522.56] P:1717.58 E:0.125091 |  Manchester United coming vainly forward
[2523.52 - 2525.52] P:1711.91 E:0.148075 |  Greenwood was offside
[2525.64 - 2529.12] P:1726.50 E:0.123915 |  Van Dijk got to the ball first in any case and just planted into the crowd
[2530.08 - 2534.10] P:1748.37 E:0.113913 |  Great result for Liverpool great score line for Liverpool
[2534.76 - 2540.96] P:1659.95 E:0.119396 |  For Manchester United for Oligo Nassau-Shar. This is the stuff of nightmares. It is it isn't you know
[2540.96 - 2544.44] P:1529.55 E:0.133395 |  They'll go in half-time United, you know, we're looking at each other though. We think you won't
[2545.16 - 2548.24] P:1633.93 E:0.138227 |  What have you done and then the other play we think you want a what have you done?
[2548.24 - 2551.86] P:1712.33 E:0.128545 |  They've done nothing at the moment Manchester United every time a man United player gets the ball
[2551.88 - 2553.88] P:1578.87 E:0.105422 |  They're looking at positive to say
[2554.52 - 2557.80] P:1500.72 E:0.141834 |  No real they don't really know what to do or who to pass to
[2558.12 - 2564.12] P:1667.93 E:0.129571 |  It's all over in the new camp or the camp new whatever you prefer Barcelona 1 Real Madrid 2
[2564.64 - 2570.08] P:1706.22 E:0.131029 |  So in Spain tomorrow in Catalonia tomorrow, they'll be talking about the manager's job at Barcelona
[2570.36 - 2575.56] P:1669.42 E:0.129377 |  And in England tomorrow in Manchester tonight, they'll be talking about the manager's job
[2576.08 - 2579.72] P:1713.94 E:0.122467 |  Here at Old Trafford unless we see something
[2580.68 - 2586.44] P:1756.55 E:0.118311 |  Transformational in the second half Paul Pogba on the substitutes bench. I guess he's got to make a change at half-time

[2591.20 - 2597.96] P:1708.94 E:0.124643 |  Your players who do you bring on who do you take off got Lingard on the bench as well who we know can make a huge difference
[2597.96 - 2599.96] P:1721.61 E:0.136103 |  When he comes on Cavani as well
[2601.00 - 2606.96] P:1830.06 E:0.140220 |  Manchester United coming forward but Liverpool leading by three goals to nil five line on the world service from the BBC
[2607.96 - 2613.96] P:1739.15 E:0.126154 |  Highlights tonight match of the day have passed ten five-life football daily podcast in the morning to hear all of the

[2625.68 - 2628.56] P:1834.65 E:0.128623 |  But we've still got over a half of football to play yet
[2629.32 - 2631.88] P:1771.87 E:0.130083 |  Canate at the back puts his foot on the ball and
[2632.60 - 2636.56] P:1814.10 E:0.121479 |  And really in some ways, I think he set the tone canate
[2637.08 - 2642.28] P:1749.74 E:0.128194 |  Coming into the team strong performance confident performance only his third appearance
[2642.80 - 2644.12] P:1687.88 E:0.104555 |  Playing at the back
[2644.12 - 2646.80] P:1720.29 E:0.128729 |  But really the issues at the back have been at the other end
[2647.24 - 2653.68] P:1755.64 E:0.123068 |  MacTomonet comes out with the ball from Firmino and then Firmino just nibbles back at him free kick Fred takes it quickly out to the left-hand side
[2654.40 - 2659.00] P:1736.45 E:0.117361 |  And just United need something quickly. We're in the 45th minute
[2659.88 - 2663.16] P:1838.12 E:0.136339 |  Halftime break coming most of all Trafford sits quietly
[2663.64 - 2670.82] P:1803.94 E:0.121051 |  Not that section to our right. You can hear them. Here's Rashford on the left-hand side Rashford back to Fred Fred now lays it forward to Shaw
[2670.96 - 2675.46] P:1706.24 E:0.107705 |  Shaw's past a stray into the penalty area Liverpool clear
[2676.44 - 2679.32] P:1682.74 E:0.110944 |  Linda Lough back to MacTomonet
[2680.28 - 2685.24] P:1755.04 E:0.132760 |  Thought that missing Firmino might be an issue for Liverpool, but not a bit of it
[2685.60 - 2691.40] P:1806.01 E:0.137712 |  And here's Rashford now forward into the penalty area finding way through all world played Rashford and then pulls it back
[2691.72 - 2695.96] P:1838.60 E:0.135225 |  Van Dyke was there instead of Ronaldo Liverpool clear. Yeah great bit of skill that
[2696.32 - 2703.60] P:1758.62 E:0.117646 |  From Rashford down the left-hand side goes past Trent Alexander. No problem at all great play from Rashford
[2704.52 - 2706.68] P:1819.02 E:0.125428 |  inspirational stuff that didn't have the final pass
[2707.20 - 2712.20] P:1759.81 E:0.129554 |  Van Dyke was there as I say instead of Ronaldo and now Liverpool come forward again Robertson angles it back
[2712.24 - 2716.12] P:1745.79 E:0.121987 |  This is going a long way, but Bruno Fernandez will get there first just pushes it away
[2716.60 - 2721.48] P:1667.59 E:0.143195 |  Takes Kater out of the game. He found Rashford three minutes of added time being played now
[2721.60 - 2726.80] P:1765.15 E:0.136642 |  Manchester United trying to find the goal that they really need before halftime green with through for Ronaldo
[2727.04 - 2733.16] P:1725.37 E:0.130417 |  Ronaldo blocked by Allison who came out well from the angle blocked the attempted little clip and then Ronaldo has a swing
[2733.16 - 2733.92] P:1710.53 E:0.135099 |  Oh
[2733.92 - 2738.68] P:1806.55 E:0.139836 |  Ronaldo has a swing at Jones. He kicked at the ball, but he caught the player who was on the ground
[2739.12 - 2742.76] P:1735.26 E:0.139340 |  Liverpool react Bruno Fernandez is in there trying to take Ronaldo away
[2742.84 - 2749.28] P:1815.25 E:0.126255 |  This could this could easily be a red card for Ronaldo depends what the officials have seen Anthony Taylor is there
[2750.08 - 2753.68] P:1854.95 E:0.132050 |  Fred is is having a little dust up with canate as well
[2754.20 - 2759.72] P:1746.74 E:0.128601 |  Ronaldo has been has been taken away. He's now left the scene of this kafufo down in one corner
[2760.48 - 2763.08] P:1616.24 E:0.134366 |  Anthony Taylor is pointing to Ronaldo
[2763.68 - 2767.12] P:1692.31 E:0.130620 |  He's walking away from it now. He says to Ronaldo. He's pointing a finger
[2767.12 - 2769.48] P:1717.29 E:0.128175 |  Oh, I think he might be going. No, it's a yellow card
[2769.76 - 2777.44] P:1739.06 E:0.128142 |  It's a yellow card Ronaldo does the motion of the ball and says that he's kicking at the ball and Anthony Taylor says only yellow card
[2777.96 - 2784.52] P:1685.43 E:0.126358 |  Wow, wow, wow, that is if I've ever seen frustration that is total frustration there
[2786.00 - 2789.56] P:1732.01 E:0.136890 |  Wow, it was Joe's that got to the ball first actually and then he started to shield it
[2790.08 - 2792.96] P:1554.74 E:0.135357 |  Yeah, it was it was aggressive from Ronaldo
[2793.40 - 2794.96] P:1812.06 E:0.138339 |  Well, I'm gonna get the ball
[2794.96 - 2799.92] P:1834.18 E:0.124653 |  Jones is shielding the ball does well and does well and Ronaldo swings a foot rounding
[2799.92 - 2804.60] P:1795.08 E:0.128723 |  John scores to ground falling on the ball and Ronaldo kicks twice at the ball
[2804.60 - 2810.00] P:1717.72 E:0.129878 |  Which is in Jones midriff as he lies on the ground and does make contact with the ball. He does kick the ball
[2810.00 - 2814.80] P:1739.64 E:0.124150 |  Yeah, he does but I think it was the aggressive nature that he kicked the ball as well. So
[2815.48 - 2818.48] P:1506.98 E:0.129709 |  I'm reflection may be seeing the replay
[2819.48 - 2825.36] P:1674.15 E:0.125687 |  Yellow card may be a lot of referees quite easily would have given a lead there could have been quite easily given red
[2825.36 - 2827.36] P:1542.43 E:0.102311 |  there could have been a reason
[2827.72 - 2830.24] P:1580.03 E:0.136213 |  There's a there's a talking point certainly
[2830.68 - 2834.88] P:1632.03 E:0.129312 |  You'll hear more about that. They might mention it Robbie and Chris and you know what?
[2836.56 - 2840.88] P:1688.45 E:0.124276 |  Might mention it a couple of times. Was it a red card? Yes or no
[2842.60 - 2844.60] P:1636.76 E:0.086673 |  There's on the fence
[2844.76 - 2846.68] P:1665.44 E:0.105017 |  Manchester United nil
[2846.72 - 2850.24] P:1840.34 E:0.139140 |  Liverpool throw a high foot from Fred and now he's caught Kate at
[2850.80 - 2856.80] P:1799.23 E:0.125284 |  No, listen, we've seen we've seen this cause problems this week Griezmann was sent off for the high foot that
[2857.68 - 2861.36] P:1830.62 E:0.119945 |  That caught for me know in the week and it's a yellow card for Fred
[2861.92 - 2864.88] P:1796.89 E:0.113914 |  He's I mean it was head height for Fred
[2865.76 - 2867.76] P:1525.03 E:0.119581 |  Kate are leaning into it
[2868.28 - 2870.28] P:1663.63 E:0.099440 |  yellow card
[2870.28 - 2872.48] P:1601.00 E:0.137936 |  And that's not a million miles away for
[2873.28 - 2877.56] P:1700.41 E:0.123933 |  From what Griezmann was sent off in Madrid in the week it doesn't make contact though
[2877.56 - 2881.28] P:1593.34 E:0.141838 |  No, he doesn't make contact at all seeing the replay kind of pulls his foot
[2881.28 - 2885.80] P:1726.16 E:0.126746 |  I he knows he's going high and then he decides to pull out Fred because he sees Kater's head there
[2885.80 - 2892.36] P:1620.70 E:0.123562 |  He's trying to stand over Kater and apologize to the physios as well looks concerned Fred Kater looks okay
[2892.52 - 2894.52] P:1610.35 E:0.105137 |  He looks okay. I didn't see any contact John
[2895.36 - 2901.76] P:1675.45 E:0.132768 |  Which I think maybe a saved Fred so 3-0 the Liverpool Kater Jota and Salah with his
[2902.08 - 2904.08] P:1628.13 E:0.113782 |  13th goal of the season
[2904.28 - 2906.28] P:1602.18 E:0.137682 |  Kater still receiving treatment
[2906.52 - 2911.80] P:1659.95 E:0.127783 |  So most Salah extending his Liverpool record he scored in his now in 10
[2912.36 - 2914.56] P:1600.40 E:0.125465 |  successive Liverpool matches that is
[2915.08 - 2919.92] P:1750.51 E:0.123182 |  13 and 12 appearances this season and just the record stack up
[2920.40 - 2928.68] P:1776.16 E:0.125438 |  This means that he's the first to score in Liverpool's first five away league matches of a season since Sam Raybold in
[2929.96 - 2931.72] P:1554.60 E:0.100144 |  1902
[2931.72 - 2933.72] P:1641.72 E:0.120412 |  I think I played with him Sam
[2934.52 - 2936.36] P:1545.20 E:0.098370 |  bit of a clogger
[2936.36 - 2938.36] P:1704.60 E:0.111263 |  War long woolly socks and
[2938.88 - 2946.44] P:1692.96 E:0.125519 |  And also is the first Liverpool player to score in three successive matches at Manchester United
[2946.44 - 2947.44] P:1574.75 E:0.118082 |  So
[2947.44 - 2952.64] P:1701.04 E:0.134889 |  I mean Salah's correct collecting records like they're going out of fashion. I've got some vinyl
[2952.64 - 2956.44] P:1469.38 E:0.118064 |  That's about all the records I collected well, they're all the rage
[2956.96 - 2961.64] P:1832.48 E:0.138158 |  Here's Robertson Robertson playing it through Jota in the middle now to the right Salah left for Chinese in
[2961.64 - 2965.08] P:1777.20 E:0.136919 |  It's a ball in added time at the end of the first half
[2965.68 - 2968.94] P:1845.38 E:0.137147 |  Salah scored again as easy as you like
[2969.44 - 2971.12] P:1767.91 E:0.115269 |  12 yards out
[2971.12 - 2978.68] P:1734.38 E:0.119044 |  No backlift bottom corner. This is embarrassing for Manchester United and Ali gonna Salchard
[2978.84 - 2982.56] P:1675.89 E:0.115391 |  But what a result for Jurgen Klopp and for Liverpool
[2983.32 - 2989.00] P:1696.29 E:0.113628 |  Halftime coming up Manchester United mill Liverpool for
[2989.72 - 2995.64] P:1681.02 E:0.132087 |  That is an incredible score line. I mean Liverpool Manchester, you know, I'm looking at the replay here
[2995.64 - 2997.64] P:1716.90 E:0.121132 |  I'm looking at Manchester United's defense and
[2998.28 - 3000.08] P:1582.69 E:0.121008 |  shores left
[3000.08 - 3002.08] P:1642.52 E:0.137261 |  What is it to on one is?
[3002.20 - 3007.16] P:1723.89 E:0.128483 |  It's trying to come across he's trying to help his center half out center halves have crossed over never crossed over
[3007.52 - 3012.12] P:1728.95 E:0.131509 |  Linda loves trying to get in sure has to leave south has to leave Salah on the far post
[3012.76 - 3020.44] P:1670.27 E:0.132329 |  Salah just puts it in the near post. He'd normally go across the keeper. Listen. It's so easy for Liverpool. This is they've worked so hard
[3020.44 - 3022.44] P:1610.06 E:0.148889 |  It's just
[3029.24 - 3031.24] P:1573.12 E:0.141571 |  Talk about a chorus of booze
[3031.44 - 3033.60] P:1673.99 E:0.136363 |  That was a cacophony of booze
[3034.44 - 3039.60] P:1592.02 E:0.135628 |  Inside all traffic. I don't think I've ever heard all traffic boo like that
[3040.52 - 3042.24] P:1598.85 E:0.131699 |  not
[3042.24 - 3044.24] P:1633.70 E:0.138617 |  70,000 of them anyway. I mean it's just
[3045.00 - 3046.52] P:1609.07 E:0.121766 |  It's still going
[3046.52 - 3053.48] P:1608.25 E:0.128226 |  They must be so embarrassed the fans the players walking off the pitch have got to feel embarrassed as well
[3054.16 - 3055.40] P:1507.85 E:0.139321 |  Liverpool
[3055.40 - 3057.24] P:1580.84 E:0.114884 |  dominated in every
[3057.24 - 3059.24] P:1479.52 E:0.129351 |  Department you want to talk about
[3059.24 - 3061.24] P:1577.44 E:0.125757 |  Scoring goals that easy for them
[3061.24 - 3063.68] P:1750.64 E:0.142247 |  Well, you're gonna sell show walks away down the touch line
[3064.08 - 3069.96] P:1636.41 E:0.133866 |  He's chatting away to Mason Greenwood with his shot his arm around his shoulder as they disappear down the tunnel
[3070.40 - 3074.16] P:1669.66 E:0.122502 |  That for Manchester United and for soul shout was an absolute nightmare
[3074.84 - 3079.04] P:1664.35 E:0.124434 |  You name it it went wrong and Liverpool scored four goals
[3079.88 - 3083.00] P:1721.95 E:0.110769 |  Kater in the fifth minute Jotter in the 14th and
[3083.40 - 3092.52] P:1616.96 E:0.122749 |  Then Salah weighed in with two as we kind of felt that he would in the 38th minute and then right at the end in added time
[3093.08 - 3095.08] P:1605.16 E:0.132309 |  What a half for Liverpool
[3095.20 - 3100.16] P:1693.22 E:0.130768 |  They're looking so strong five-nil at Watford last weekend and winning in Madrid
[3100.68 - 3106.00] P:1677.06 E:0.128838 |  But this this tops the lot and we still got 45 minutes to go
[3106.60 - 3108.44] P:1684.37 E:0.116287 |  Manchester United nil
[3108.48 - 3112.92] P:1842.69 E:0.130393 |  Liverpool four we've got spider-man in the crowd Tom Holland is here
[3113.76 - 3116.32] P:1703.71 E:0.131299 |  They'll need all the superheroes to get out of this one
[3118.40 - 3123.56] P:1866.73 E:0.134149 |  Climbing the walls before long here inside old Trafford you would think because this is embarrassing
[3124.48 - 3127.72] P:1884.28 E:0.119760 |  For Manchester United. Oh my word John
[3127.72 - 3134.72] P:1907.58 E:0.113193 |  I want to take you back to to January last year and we were here to watch Manchester United play Manchester City in a
[3134.76 - 3138.84] P:1925.30 E:0.127792 |  League Cup semi-final first leg city with three nil up at halftime and we said
[3139.04 - 3145.00] P:2001.03 E:0.113014 |  We'll open the phone lines because this could be it for Oligo and Solciar. Well, this is for and it's Liverpool
[3145.28 - 3152.72] P:1926.39 E:0.119114 |  Yeah, and we've said many times actually over the course of the last couple of seasons that he has tended to get results when he's
[3153.12 - 3159.48] P:1898.22 E:0.116240 |  Really needed them and and he did you know they they staged a comeback of sorts in that match and
[3160.36 - 3165.48] P:1844.58 E:0.118096 |  And and got themselves up into second place in the Premier League last season
[3165.92 - 3172.20] P:1852.71 E:0.122543 |  But there is a lot of noise around him right now this season. We're only in the middle of October
[3172.64 - 3174.44] P:1878.18 E:0.082142 |  but
[3174.44 - 3181.84] P:1941.93 E:0.128376 |  As we sit here watching this empty red seats all around old Trafford not sure how many will be occupied at the start of the second half
[3182.52 - 3187.72] P:1877.32 E:0.117859 |  This is a really tough time. The the pressure is ratcheted right on him here
[3188.48 - 3193.32] P:1991.50 E:0.128205 |  And Dion as good as Liverpool have been and they have been very very good
[3194.00 - 3199.88] P:1927.72 E:0.120862 |  Manchester United have made themselves problems time and time again at the back
[3200.20 - 3206.12] P:1723.32 E:0.121446 |  And you know what John mentioned it before the game, you know this tag of Olly doesn't know they have no
[3206.84 - 3209.56] P:1796.33 E:0.129655 |  They have no structure. How do they play?
[3209.56 - 3212.34] P:1686.46 E:0.126481 |  You know, they do they play tippy-tappy football do they go long?
[3212.44 - 3216.72] P:1867.48 E:0.101902 |  What do they do do they play through the furs and you watch that and you think well?
[3216.72 - 3221.32] P:1857.43 E:0.121213 |  I'm not quite sure how Manchester United play because I can see one Berserker looking forward and
[3221.92 - 3226.96] P:1865.37 E:0.128921 |  There's nothing I can see Greenwood making a run and they the run hasn't been seen they are so disjointed
[3227.64 - 3231.32] P:1686.93 E:0.126817 |  And and the thing that really annoys me is when the ball goes dead
[3231.64 - 3234.52] P:1927.53 E:0.125992 |  That's when you need your leaders to say right

[3304.60 - 3309.12] P:1693.66 E:0.127983 |  I think Dion nailed it really, you know Liverpool have an identity, you know when they press the ball
[3309.12 - 3314.88] P:1792.51 E:0.123992 |  They press as a unit Manchester United don't what are they and the question is is where are they heading?
[3315.40 - 3320.68] P:1764.46 E:0.123146 |  Under Oli will Oli survive this? I mean four nil is bad enough, but this could be anything

[3352.52 - 3356.88] P:1822.64 E:0.118918 |  It had to be this season for Oli, but it's just not happening for him. Is it?
[3357.36 - 3360.72] P:2000.22 E:0.133496 |  Chris is the difference this season that you know, we said it before the game
[3360.72 - 3367.32] P:1927.00 E:0.123170 |  This isn't the first time that the vultures have circled over Oli gonna. So I is the difference now because of those players

[3410.40 - 3417.04] P:1860.95 E:0.115017 |  Are there any Manchester United fans out there who think Oli is still the man to take the club forward?
[3418.20 - 3424.24] P:1965.84 E:0.125248 |  Chris, thank you very much Chris Sutton and Robbie Savage with you for six oh six after full-time here at Old Trafford

[3438.88 - 3444.72] P:1843.13 E:0.119245 |  Four nil to Liverpool and the teams are out for the start of the second half and the answer to the question
[3444.72 - 3450.20] P:1867.35 E:0.127179 |  We asked at the end of the first period is there are lots and lots of empty red seats looking at the Stretford end
[3450.52 - 3453.76] P:1730.22 E:0.122443 |  Maybe people haven't come back to their seats yet, but Sir Alex Ferguson stand
[3454.16 - 3458.80] P:1716.98 E:0.112583 |  I mean second tier of the Alex Ferguson stand. It's almost half full
[3458.80 - 3464.96] P:1730.19 E:0.125054 |  Yeah, you can actually see the whole S of Manchester because you the whole S there in the lower tier

[3471.52 - 3475.84] P:1832.76 E:0.126320 |  Unhappy managers move and they stood almost like statues
[3476.28 - 3481.12] P:1784.88 E:0.126871 |  Waiting for Liverpool to come out to join them Pogba's come on. That's the change that Oli Gunnar Solcher has made
[3481.12 - 3483.12] P:1762.57 E:0.105882 |  He's brought him on for Greenwood Dion
[3483.44 - 3488.20] P:1662.11 E:0.121987 |  Yeah, and hopefully that hopefully he's gonna make a difference decision-making maybe picking a pass
[3489.36 - 3491.36] P:1799.29 E:0.127949 |  driving forward
[3492.12 - 3498.80] P:1770.29 E:0.133833 |  Fernandez putting the challenge in on Curtis Jones who came on as the first half substitute for the injured James Milner and
[3500.16 - 3503.52] P:1776.58 E:0.141930 |  Yellow card out for Bruno Fernandez per talking
[3504.20 - 3507.00] P:1711.03 E:0.124983 |  Telling the assistant what he what he thinks of him
[3507.00 - 3511.12] P:1725.47 E:0.117005 |  So yellow card for Bruno Fernandez right at the start of the second period. It's quite a bad tackle
[3511.12 - 3513.12] P:1633.54 E:0.119671 |  I should look at the replay there and he catches
[3513.12 - 3518.56] P:1630.87 E:0.136487 |  Jones down the down the left card didn't get much of the ball at all. So frustration still there at the moment
[3519.04 - 3521.04] P:1587.48 E:0.125764 |  Judging by that first challenge
[3521.04 - 3527.04] P:1820.58 E:0.122333 |  There's unhappiness there that that reaction from Bruno Fernandez how they looked when they were standing there
[3528.00 - 3531.76] P:1803.97 E:0.124742 |  11 individuals waiting for the Liverpool players to come out
[3532.40 - 3536.00] P:1856.25 E:0.133244 |  That in itself spoke volumes even if they weren't speaking to anyone
[3536.64 - 3541.28] P:1909.12 E:0.135635 |  Free kick Alexander-Arnold then on the right hand side Liverpool looking for five in it goes for me
[3541.28 - 3545.04] P:1795.84 E:0.111494 |  No, got his head to it but glanced it right across the penalty area and behind for a goal kick
[3545.28 - 3547.68] P:1820.00 E:0.134090 |  So Pogba goes chasing after the ball
[3548.08 - 3553.04] P:1824.23 E:0.121174 |  To pick it up from in front of the hoardings down the little slope there and throws it back on
[3553.36 - 3560.32] P:1739.51 E:0.124222 |  That's better in terms of body language Manchester United now then with Dehaer, Wanderzakha, Lindelof, Maguire and Shaw
[3560.88 - 3567.16] P:1776.26 E:0.127333 |  Defence has been all over the place again for United midfield of MacTomon A Fred Pogba Bruno Fernandez
[3568.00 - 3570.00] P:1652.48 E:0.106110 |  Marcus Rashford and

[3579.92 - 3583.20] P:1801.65 E:0.122306 |  Salah Firmino and Jota and if you weren't listening in the first half
[3583.60 - 3590.64] P:1780.57 E:0.112080 |  Liverpool's four their fab four were scored by Kater Jota and two for Salah
[3591.44 - 3592.64] P:1747.53 E:0.078280 |  Free kick
[3592.64 - 3597.44] P:1706.94 E:0.128976 |  Rather drop ball send a field Anthony Taylor and Liverpool knock it back into their own half
[3598.40 - 3602.80] P:1836.77 E:0.126541 |  Liverpool supporters that you can hear in great voice great cheer
[3603.36 - 3608.88] P:1812.26 E:0.126614 |  This is some result after the week that they've had this is the third of four consecutive away matches
[3609.36 - 3611.36] P:1682.17 E:0.122241 |  So Watford they won five-nil
[3611.52 - 3615.60] P:1800.37 E:0.123320 |  Madrid that match in Madrid that thrilling game came back to win three two

[3622.16 - 3626.64] P:1794.38 E:0.126084 |  Now there's a mistake a rare mistake for uh for Liverpool on the left hand side
[3627.60 - 3632.48] P:1798.30 E:0.118315 |  Just um the poor church actually miscontrolled it Jones and it's out of play for a throw in to Manchester United
[3633.12 - 3638.16] P:1763.24 E:0.135458 |  I mean they've they've just carried on where they left off Liverpool ball at the feet just playing one twos
[3638.56 - 3643.36] P:1789.80 E:0.132287 |  The what Liverpool do really well as they pass the ball at pace when you pass the ball at pace
[3643.68 - 3648.16] P:1550.10 E:0.128231 |  You do something called passing the ball on passing the time on you give your teammate lots of time on the ball
[3648.16 - 3650.32] P:1605.35 E:0.119743 |  And they're doing it and then just start the second half
[3651.76 - 3654.56] P:1771.97 E:0.138934 |  Manchester United trying to build from the back playing towards the
[3655.20 - 3656.64] P:1502.31 E:0.104202 |  the now

[3666.00 - 3671.76] P:1656.78 E:0.140596 |  Lots of empty red seats right in the middle of the lower tier of the straight for then one of the most popular areas
[3672.32 - 3676.72] P:1665.23 E:0.118718 |  Bruno Fernandez incidentally that that yellow card was for descent not for the tackle
[3677.20 - 3679.04] P:1496.02 E:0.128508 |  You could easily have got it for the tackle actually
[3679.36 - 3681.20] P:1494.87 E:0.125923 |  Bruno Fernandez himself is
[3681.20 - 3682.88] P:1488.43 E:0.112978 |  Fouls sent to field
[3682.88 - 3685.92] P:1539.14 E:0.130972 |  And Manchester United with Ronaldo and Shaw

[3757.60 - 3764.24] P:1652.47 E:0.133610 |  In place of all the outside of his boot which dissects the two centre halves of Manchester United
[3764.32 - 3768.16] P:1663.84 E:0.132887 |  Salah gets onto it the rest is history. What a finish
[3768.72 - 3770.72] P:1670.37 E:0.127154 |  A hat trick for Mo Salah
[3770.80 - 3773.60] P:1729.92 E:0.135689 |  Liverpool are making this look like a training game

[3811.60 - 3813.84] P:1782.25 E:0.137627 |  Both teams were struggling that season
[3814.48 - 3816.72] P:1689.62 E:0.136538 |  Manchester United ended up being relegated
[3818.00 - 3821.04] P:1580.89 E:0.130516 |  But today in 2021

[3842.88 - 3845.76] P:1787.89 E:0.114102 |  Here's Pogba playing it forward ball bounces back
[3845.84 - 3849.52] P:1713.29 E:0.127765 |  But Robertson is there and is able to put it out of play for a throw to Manchester United down the right
[3849.52 - 3853.28] P:1675.13 E:0.136066 |  Yeah, there doesn't seem to be any danger at this present time of Manchester United
[3853.92 - 3855.92] P:1551.09 E:0.132067 |  Causing Liverpool any problems
[3856.56 - 3862.64] P:1608.48 E:0.143972 |  No reaction as yet. No shouting. No screaming. No anger from the man United players United coming forward
[3862.64 - 3866.32] P:1672.85 E:0.125949 |  Here's the cross van Dijk gets up and challenge heads it away
[3866.88 - 3870.48] P:1744.43 E:0.132494 |  I'm not sure Liverpool's traveling support will ever have sung louder
[3871.52 - 3877.92] P:1832.63 E:0.136966 |  Maguire takes control plays a lovely ball to Ronaldo inside the box Ronaldo skipping from left to right shoots and scores
[3878.96 - 3880.96] P:1812.72 E:0.137697 |  very sick
[3881.36 - 3884.48] P:1789.89 E:0.144049 |  Well despite everything that's the same old Ronaldo
[3885.04 - 3888.64] P:1845.89 E:0.136329 |  Super pass from the choir great work from Ronaldo. He had a lot to do
[3889.36 - 3895.44] P:1860.47 E:0.131287 |  And he drove it right footed beyond the dive of allison and Manchester United at least are on the score sheet
[3896.40 - 3901.68] P:1695.53 E:0.126350 |  United won Liverpool five. Yeah, no celebration whatsoever to see in the replay
[3901.68 - 3904.48] P:1702.80 E:0.136260 |  He's just on side played on side by Robertson at left back
[3905.04 - 3909.36] P:1519.38 E:0.140338 |  He gets into that area just inside the left downside of the box on the corner
[3909.68 - 3916.00] P:1786.57 E:0.134170 |  Drops his left shoulder comes in on his right and curls into the far corner past allison a really really good finish
[3917.36 - 3919.36] P:1693.92 E:0.118503 |  That's Ronaldo. That's what he does
[3919.36 - 3924.64] P:1701.78 E:0.122966 |  The the match has not restarted yet. So VAR just just absolutely checking
[3925.52 - 3927.36] P:1559.74 E:0.121449 |  That he was on site
[3927.36 - 3929.36] P:1554.61 E:0.107708 |  the weight goes on
[3929.52 - 3934.40] P:1684.19 E:0.144156 |  And uh, it looks on site. No, no the goal is ruled out
[3935.36 - 3940.88] P:1675.34 E:0.134722 |  Liverpool fans cheer even more loudly. Well the lines we're seeing here
[3943.44 - 3945.92] P:1656.68 E:0.136182 |  That looked on site the the shot that we saw
[3946.56 - 3950.00] P:1590.35 E:0.138619 |  With those lines it looked like he was he was on side by a good half yard, but
[3950.72 - 3955.44] P:1710.66 E:0.131334 |  Maybe they're the wrongs. Maybe they're the wrong features. We're looking at it remains Manchester United nil
[3955.92 - 3957.44] P:1707.81 E:0.125989 |  Liverpool five
[3957.44 - 3962.80] P:1786.78 E:0.128370 |  And uh, Cristiano Ronaldo's very good goal does not stand. It's as you were
[3963.44 - 3965.44] P:1630.06 E:0.116137 |  Five nil
[3965.44 - 3972.48] P:1518.35 E:0.138765 |  This is incredible. It really is. I've not seen united players like this looking, you know for lawn
[3974.08 - 3977.92] P:1694.96 E:0.138036 |  Clueless at the moment as well. Not sure who to pass to where to pass how to pass
[3978.64 - 3982.16] P:1535.15 E:0.133184 |  They have got to find a way at the moment man united
[3982.72 - 3985.60] P:1701.13 E:0.129988 |  To do something positive give us something positive
[3987.20 - 3989.52] P:1521.71 E:0.134052 |  Liverpool defending at the moment and uh
[3990.16 - 3991.68] P:1451.71 E:0.109603 |  Ibrahim a
[3991.68 - 3995.12] P:1630.84 E:0.140295 |  Canate before the match it looked like Liverpool had problems with no Fabinho
[3995.84 - 3999.60] P:1717.66 E:0.140040 |  But no Fabinho no problem. He has Jones playing it through maguire
[3999.92 - 4004.56] P:1837.89 E:0.132368 |  Looks to have caught jotter on the edge of the box. The referee's having a look. He's given the free kick
[4004.64 - 4005.84] P:1825.80 E:0.115521 |  It was in the d
[4005.84 - 4008.00] P:1894.54 E:0.135976 |  I mean, it was so close to the penalty area
[4008.16 - 4011.20] P:1781.35 E:0.121300 |  Maguire lunged in just as jotter broke through
[4011.52 - 4017.28] P:1797.78 E:0.124040 |  He was sent spiraling into the box and referee taylor had a long think about that and has given us as a free kick
[4017.44 - 4020.48] P:1713.23 E:0.133229 |  Yeah, I think he's right as well. It was it was a yard or two outside
[4020.96 - 4024.16] P:1649.67 E:0.142477 |  The box right in the middle of the d as well not too far from the 18 yard line
[4024.64 - 4026.72] P:1877.05 E:0.132087 |  I think it's jones that has two or three options
[4027.36 - 4029.36] P:1494.30 E:0.106414 |  maguire's pointing
[4029.36 - 4031.92] P:1669.10 E:0.133736 |  Telling wambasaka to stay with famino
[4033.36 - 4035.84] P:1761.93 E:0.143002 |  And i'm just watching that. Yeah, he just catches jotter
[4036.48 - 4039.52] P:1661.19 E:0.141981 |  Before he catches the ball edge of the box. We've got that one spot on
[4040.40 - 4042.16] P:1583.55 E:0.124150 |  yeah, he uh
[4042.16 - 4045.20] P:1775.28 E:0.140338 |  He just caught the trailing leg of jotter who was sent uh
[4045.84 - 4050.24] P:1701.74 E:0.134595 |  Falling into the penalty area and then cleared the ball yellow card for maguire
[4050.88 - 4054.00] P:1743.96 E:0.125302 |  For that challenge, but it's right on the edge of the penalty area
[4054.56 - 4059.76] P:1691.26 E:0.120193 |  So free kick for liverpool. It's one of those where we say maybe it's a little bit too close
[4059.84 - 4066.40] P:1641.78 E:0.126088 |  But nothing is impossible for liverpool today. I've just looked at the center center half here van dyke. This is definitely van dyke territory
[4067.20 - 4070.00] P:1655.70 E:0.137733 |  Definitely van dyke territory the way he's striked the ball
[4070.96 - 4072.96] P:1917.79 E:0.124705 |  He's now striding forward
[4073.36 - 4075.68] P:1837.83 E:0.130788 |  That would put the seal on it wouldn't it if van dyke
[4076.16 - 4078.64] P:1801.87 E:0.132628 |  Flatters this into the back of the manchester united net
[4079.12 - 4084.08] P:1829.58 E:0.118122 |  Well, there are four of them talking about it. Salah's already scored a hat trick. Don't be greedy more
[4085.12 - 4087.28] P:1737.08 E:0.138700 |  Alexander randall likes the look of this as well
[4087.76 - 4089.76] P:1614.96 E:0.149191 |  Be greedy moe be greedy moe
[4091.28 - 4094.56] P:1658.56 E:0.119398 |  Van dyke's wonder away, it won't be him might be tapped short
[4094.80 - 4100.08] P:1687.44 E:0.124943 |  Henderson is is in a position where he's winding himself up four or five yards behind the ball
[4101.04 - 4105.44] P:1727.62 E:0.127840 |  So, uh, you think alexander randall into top corner free kick alexander randall little tap
[4105.44 - 4110.08] P:1852.62 E:0.119713 |  Salah hits it into the bottom of the wall bounces out for roberton roberton now to the left hand side
[4110.24 - 4112.24] P:1744.29 E:0.092995 |  that's played across by
[4112.40 - 4115.28] P:1817.66 E:0.129196 |  Jones and deflected wide of the near post from that side
[4115.84 - 4119.04] P:1624.45 E:0.142269 |  And it is a corner for liverpool
[4120.00 - 4122.00] P:1608.86 E:0.126749 |  So manchester united nil
[4122.00 - 4125.52] P:1707.26 E:0.133168 |  liverpool five rinaldo's goal was ruled out
[4126.00 - 4128.72] P:1709.70 E:0.111772 |  So i've had to get the uh find the tipx pen
[4129.68 - 4132.64] P:1592.16 E:0.129476 |  So, uh, rinaldo's name will be expunged
[4133.68 - 4135.68] P:1764.21 E:0.115603 |  corner vent for liverpool
[4135.68 - 4137.68] P:1796.85 E:0.140074 |  Into the near post united get ahead to it
[4138.32 - 4142.64] P:1627.15 E:0.114845 |  and uh fred is underneath it and then brunner fernandez
[4143.04 - 4148.56] P:1669.33 E:0.137943 |  Wax it away downfield allison's out of the penalty area. Oh, there's confidence for you. There's confidence in nonchalance
[4149.04 - 4151.04] P:1555.46 E:0.102496 |  uh, allison that
[4151.04 - 4154.56] P:1747.81 E:0.130833 |  70-yard pass the goalkeeper took it down on the top of his thigh
[4155.20 - 4158.32] P:1740.26 E:0.132343 |  And then cleared it downfield and liverpool come again
[4158.96 - 4164.48] P:1763.66 E:0.116080 |  Manchester united stretched here femeno on the left hand side femeno up against wanbasaka
[4164.72 - 4167.04] P:1782.55 E:0.122718 |  Left footed cross to here as able to catch it
[4167.04 - 4169.92] P:1737.95 E:0.134264 |  So come in jonathan agnew with the latest on pakistan india
[4170.08 - 4176.72] P:1664.38 E:0.137438 |  Well, it's going pakistan's way very easily at the moment 71 for no wicked chasing 152 to win terrific batting
[4176.72 - 4182.32] P:1606.90 E:0.131042 |  It's from mohammed reiswan 35 that out from 30 balls in the captain barbara's arm 34 from 30 virac coley
[4182.64 - 4187.84] P:1738.28 E:0.130777 |  A face rather like uh, alex ferguson's possibly at the moment looks like he's chewing a wasp not happy at all
[4187.92 - 4191.04] P:1723.82 E:0.123808 |  71 for no wickets are 81 needed from 61
[4191.68 - 4193.68] P:1736.60 E:0.133980 |  Even nailed it jonathan as ever
[4194.40 - 4196.24] P:1611.16 E:0.134399 |  Even though you can't see him
[4196.24 - 4200.56] P:1749.22 E:0.136563 |  United are going to make a double change next ballo and cavani
[4201.12 - 4203.12] P:1746.28 E:0.123435 |  are going to come on i've managed to
[4204.00 - 4207.92] P:1681.85 E:0.144986 |  Make christiano ronaldo's name disappear from my list of scorers
[4208.72 - 4210.72] P:1704.12 E:0.139233 |  And we've got over half an hour to play
[4211.12 - 4213.12] P:1645.67 E:0.122871 |  Manchester united nil
[4213.12 - 4218.48] P:1776.90 E:0.127466 |  Liverpool five is the scoreline of the day the scoreline of the weekend
[4219.28 - 4221.28] P:1606.18 E:0.125854 |  The scoreline of the season
[4222.00 - 4224.32] P:1809.18 E:0.127732 |  It is as the americans say
[4225.20 - 4227.20] P:1773.21 E:0.130675 |  A score aligned for the ages
[4229.04 - 4231.92] P:1656.06 E:0.135191 |  Five nil for Liverpool at all trapper
[4232.56 - 4235.68] P:1762.27 E:0.105919 |  It would be their biggest win ever here
[4236.48 - 4238.96] P:1693.00 E:0.125883 |  bruner finandez crossing it's cleared away
[4239.52 - 4243.60] P:1738.05 E:0.128736 |  By canate on the edge of the six yard box cleared up into the air
[4244.56 - 4253.76] P:1625.98 E:0.128095 |  By robertson pogbaz underneath it and united red shirts with the white trim white shorts black socks being humbled here by their
[4255.20 - 4257.20] P:1671.73 E:0.113959 |  greatest rivals
[4257.20 - 4262.80] P:1617.52 E:0.137787 |  And uh, wan besata crossing from the right hand side hits a Liverpool defender of bounces behind and Manchester united
[4263.20 - 4265.04] P:1794.50 E:0.142644 |  Have a corner it's going to be
[4265.04 - 4268.56] P:1752.37 E:0.131542 |  Rashford and bruno finandez who are going to be substituted
[4269.92 - 4274.72] P:1743.98 E:0.146342 |  So corner is taken short and uh, and cater is caught in there
[4275.68 - 4281.28] P:1739.52 E:0.115609 |  As as the ball comes back just outside the box and pogbaz slid in got the ball
[4281.36 - 4285.28] P:1727.85 E:0.119164 |  But he caught cater as well and it's a free kick and it's a yellow card for pogbaz
[4286.08 - 4289.28] P:1689.68 E:0.138464 |  Yellow cards are mounted up now. They can man chest united. That's just pure
[4289.92 - 4294.08] P:1733.06 E:0.129525 |  Frustration as well. I mean they've got a corner man chest united put the ball in the box
[4294.80 - 4299.04] P:1708.44 E:0.133946 |  Don't try and complicate it. You're not having a good day lads put the ball in the box give yourself a chance
[4300.00 - 4304.80] P:1669.59 E:0.138528 |  Just watching that me play there. I think he did dive in. I think the referee look at his head stood showing
[4304.80 - 4310.16] P:1716.88 E:0.136746 |  Is there not there is some stood showing as well? He's very lucky. I've seen them given us red cards as well
[4310.64 - 4313.92] P:1660.27 E:0.147083 |  Again pogbaz lucky. That's a couple of players now that have been lucky. I think
[4314.72 - 4316.72] P:1746.70 E:0.129819 |  reynauldal in the first half
[4316.96 - 4318.96] P:1781.42 E:0.122288 |  Could have been a red card
[4318.96 - 4320.96] P:1584.18 E:0.152874 |  Bruno down the right hand side in front of us
[4321.52 - 4325.84] P:1683.75 E:0.133804 |  Oh and now hang on. I think antony taylor's shown us the rectangle there in the air
[4326.32 - 4328.32] P:1711.98 E:0.152569 |  And he's been called to come and have a look at this
[4328.88 - 4330.88] P:1765.26 E:0.133501 |  So this could be pogbaz in trouble
[4331.44 - 4337.36] P:1845.80 E:0.134178 |  The very fact that the bar stewart atwell has called antony taylor across he's sprinted across the field here
[4337.76 - 4339.20] P:1492.99 E:0.104855 |  It's just down
[4339.20 - 4345.28] P:1617.30 E:0.129670 |  On the side of the the ground where we are the the tv screen on its black stalk
[4345.84 - 4350.96] P:1724.64 E:0.127828 |  Anthony taylor's now in front of it. Look shores come across to the edge of the pitch the assistant
[4353.52 - 4358.48] P:1740.76 E:0.140931 |  Gary bezik is saying to the manchester united players maguire and fred and shore who are looking over the shoulder
[4358.48 - 4363.28] P:1745.50 E:0.135405 |  If this is a rectangle, this is bad news as antony taylor moves away. That means
[4364.32 - 4370.24] P:1747.40 E:0.136087 |  That the yellow card is ruled out and paul pogbarr is going to be sent off. There's the red card for pogbaz
[4370.88 - 4378.16] P:1789.50 E:0.126375 |  And now manchester united five male down deliver pool have paul podbarr half time substitute sent off
[4380.80 - 4382.80] P:1787.11 E:0.119511 |  Wow and I
[4383.60 - 4386.00] P:1830.42 E:0.138519 |  He left the floor is out of control
[4386.40 - 4388.08] P:1760.83 E:0.116650 |  His studs were showing
[4388.08 - 4391.60] P:1691.67 E:0.138173 |  And the way that paul pogb is gone off the pitch as well. He's kind of resigned to the fact that
[4392.64 - 4394.64] P:1809.87 E:0.135609 |  That wasn't his best challenge
[4395.36 - 4398.56] P:1724.51 E:0.141974 |  I'm not sure who he caught there. I'm not sure who the tackle was on was it on cater
[4399.44 - 4402.00] P:1797.43 E:0.136299 |  He's caught him cater still down actually getting treatment. So
[4403.12 - 4406.96] P:1752.68 E:0.134366 |  Paul pogbarr in the corner of the ground was walked straight off the field no messing
[4408.00 - 4409.28] P:1697.51 E:0.144370 |  And he passes the corner flag
[4409.28 - 4414.56] P:1700.96 E:0.132214 |  There are some supporters applauding him in the the bottom section of the strep for den but he disappears down the tunnel
[4415.28 - 4417.28] P:1717.90 E:0.127871 |  Which is now pulled back
[4417.36 - 4420.00] P:1659.61 E:0.130393 |  So manchester united down to ten men
[4420.88 - 4422.88] P:1614.26 E:0.128188 |  five nil down deliver pool
[4423.12 - 4425.68] P:1725.65 E:0.135110 |  Oli gunnar solshar is talking to kivani
[4426.32 - 4428.32] P:1591.07 E:0.125340 |  Who's about to be sent on
[4428.72 - 4430.72] P:1601.46 E:0.122693 |  What on earth can he be saying?
[4430.72 - 4434.16] P:1551.39 E:0.133266 |  I mean where where can they possibly go in this game from here?
[4434.88 - 4439.20] P:1677.12 E:0.132229 |  You know, I think the body language. Yes, you're five down against your biggest rivals
[4439.44 - 4442.32] P:1535.17 E:0.134733 |  You've got 29 minutes to go half an hour to go
[4443.12 - 4444.56] P:1499.53 E:0.129893 |  There's a lot of game to go
[4444.56 - 4447.76] P:1671.47 E:0.128930 |  There's a lot of work to be done if you want to get back in this game, of course there is
[4448.32 - 4454.32] P:1588.21 E:0.137269 |  But show us something. They're just all individuals at the moment now. They've been brought together now the game is talking to the players
[4454.88 - 4459.84] P:1555.82 E:0.140533 |  It's far too late, but show me some positive body language manchester united players
[4460.32 - 4463.44] P:1625.73 E:0.143235 |  Well, it's bruno finandez who is the first player to be withdrawn
[4463.44 - 4468.32] P:1624.95 E:0.122814 |  So it's going to be finandez and rashford and remember there were there were doubts
[4468.40 - 4470.56] P:1758.05 E:0.128420 |  There were fitness doubts over both of these players
[4470.56 - 4474.08] P:1658.36 E:0.125512 |  So that is maybe partly the reason that they are coming off the field
[4474.48 - 4477.20] P:1582.63 E:0.127176 |  But they're both walking off with heads bowed
[4477.92 - 4478.96] P:1602.24 E:0.124838 |  rashford
[4478.96 - 4480.96] P:1561.01 E:0.136677 |  Only just back from injury himself
[4481.12 - 4486.96] P:1580.99 E:0.137687 |  And bruno finandez who had the early chance if you remember deon when it was nil nil in the brief period of this match when it was nil nil
[4487.36 - 4489.60] P:1515.34 E:0.131228 |  Bruno finandez did have the chance that wasn't taken
[4490.24 - 4492.48] P:1595.57 E:0.130592 |  And the rest is now modern history
[4495.44 - 4498.80] P:1728.84 E:0.134191 |  So kivani is on and that's it. Those are the three substitutes
[4500.32 - 4504.00] P:1798.38 E:0.134555 |  So kivani number 21 takes his place up front
[4505.52 - 4507.52] P:1672.82 E:0.133655 |  and uh
[4508.48 - 4512.40] P:1648.64 E:0.137814 |  The libra pool supporters inside are all trapped under having an absolute ball
[4513.92 - 4517.68] P:1722.26 E:0.136713 |  Little worrying for navi kata who's still receiving treatment
[4518.08 - 4522.56] P:1658.88 E:0.138500 |  And actually they've got the stretcher out and he's being lifted onto the stretcher and carried away
[4523.28 - 4528.40] P:1633.22 E:0.130232 |  And that's going to be the end of his afternoon. So alex oxley chamberland coming on for him
[4528.96 - 4530.64] P:1663.52 E:0.126092 |  I mean it was a poor challenge by
[4530.64 - 4535.12] P:1708.86 E:0.134788 |  Because of his force. Yeah, it was as well and he leaves the floor and he's you know when you see the replay
[4535.12 - 4539.76] P:1704.62 E:0.132871 |  You can see he's got his stud showing as well catches kata on the calf as well and the shin
[4540.64 - 4546.72] P:1661.30 E:0.140022 |  And the referee has no real what does he do? You know, he's trying to give me yellow card. He tries to see with his own eyes
[4547.52 - 4549.52] P:1496.83 E:0.138271 |  He looks at it again and I think he's
[4549.68 - 4554.64] P:1642.87 E:0.138253 |  Unfortunately right to give a red card to pocba. Can't challenge like that. Look where you're stud showing
[4555.20 - 4560.88] P:1680.65 E:0.132160 |  This is really tough for kata who as you'll be aware has struggled really to
[4561.84 - 4565.60] P:1682.48 E:0.129697 |  To get himself into the first team and make himself a regular
[4566.40 - 4570.24] P:1709.72 E:0.140777 |  Liverpool and they've been really promising signs again lately

[4572.24 - 4579.04] P:1739.74 E:0.131551 |  Here in the first half as he did in Madrid in the week and now he's been strapped to a stretcher and has been carried away
[4579.76 - 4582.72] P:1607.35 E:0.135358 |  And alex oxley chamberland is onto the field
[4583.68 - 4585.44] P:1756.00 E:0.129084 |  So manchester united nil

[4691.84 - 4695.92] P:1517.00 E:0.131190 |  And maguire very carefully passes it to wan bersakka on the far side
[4696.40 - 4699.76] P:1520.59 E:0.141431 |  And then wan bersakka has to turn under pressure from jones mctombine now
[4699.84 - 4704.32] P:1581.36 E:0.125995 |  He's dispossessed but the ball runs to fred and then fred a left-footed crossfield pass

[4713.20 - 4716.80] P:1695.09 E:0.123374 |  And then fred up against oxley chamberland fred finds rinaldo
[4717.12 - 4721.60] P:1738.97 E:0.129816 |  rinaldo now gets it away canate into the full back position still going left footed cross

[4750.96 - 4754.24] P:1611.67 E:0.145792 |  Liverpool are five up and they're just buzzing about they're trying to get the ball back
[4754.48 - 4756.80] P:1645.39 E:0.143423 |  When they have the ball they're buzzing about trying to get on the ball
[4757.52 - 4761.44] P:1597.10 E:0.138787 |  I mean the way they've set up today the two center halves of Liverpool haven't had a lot to defend
[4761.52 - 4767.04] P:1623.45 E:0.133122 |  But the organization's been going trends trends been outstanding kater's been absolutely brilliant. But now he's off

[4805.92 - 4808.16] P:1561.94 E:0.126717 |  Is a direction changing result
[4808.80 - 4816.64] P:1704.39 E:0.123996 |  This is a this is a real test of the manchester united hierarchy's result that what they're doing here is the right thing
[4818.64 - 4822.88] P:1644.23 E:0.137857 |  Or do they continue to do what they're doing? That's the question do they continue with ollie?

[5631.36 - 5634.72] P:1761.93 E:0.137978 |  David the guy has hands and he's waving his players as if say get into a position
[5635.04 - 5637.04] P:1700.99 E:0.133305 |  Well, I can roll the ball to you
[5637.04 - 5640.96] P:1776.47 E:0.138876 |  And the ball's given back to never fall again. Yep, they've lost it again inside their own heart
[5641.76 - 5642.72] P:1804.39 E:0.108651 |  jones

[5646.64 - 5651.52] P:1745.45 E:0.124152 |  wanda sackers carbs and rebounds to kivani and then
[5652.40 - 5654.32] P:1817.17 E:0.142117 |  Fred is rather bundled over center field
[5654.32 - 5660.40] P:1713.78 E:0.131985 |  So it's a pretty kick to manchester united and they're just going to take a breather here united after after all of that chasing of the ball
[5661.28 - 5663.28] P:1616.19 E:0.112532 |  who can blame them
[5663.52 - 5670.00] P:1685.43 E:0.139703 |  I mean the the two seven halves and libra pool canate and verge of undyke. I don't think they've been anywhere near their own
[5670.80 - 5675.92] P:1734.41 E:0.134468 |  18 yard box for the last 20 minutes 25 minutes have been on the half wayline
[5676.24 - 5683.28] P:1764.90 E:0.126060 |  Manchester united finally freds on his feet and united take the three kick
[5683.52 - 5686.96] P:1668.70 E:0.127643 |  And one bersak is going to have a little run down the right hand side
[5687.28 - 5693.52] P:1704.76 E:0.126016 |  The ball ran out of play it was touched out of play. There were two libra pool players on him challenge came in and deflected out of play
[5694.16 - 5700.32] P:1753.24 E:0.131270 |  And uh, and it's manchester united's ball. So for once for once over the course of these last 20 minutes
[5700.96 - 5702.96] P:1736.13 E:0.127566 |  Manchester united have got possession
[5703.44 - 5708.64] P:1676.42 E:0.136205 |  Inside the libra pool half. It was a foul on wanda sackers. So it's a free kick and a chance for the set piece
[5709.20 - 5713.84] P:1749.67 E:0.124993 |  And a chance for manchester united to perhaps get on the score sheet that really that's going to mean
[5714.56 - 5717.28] P:1702.59 E:0.130995 |  Diddly squat in the grand scheme of things
[5718.00 - 5723.68] P:1772.22 E:0.127392 |  Free kick out on the right manchester united have sent everyone up libra pool have actually got everyone back defender
[5724.48 - 5725.84] P:1819.50 E:0.109563 |  so this
[5725.84 - 5729.92] P:1855.87 E:0.132727 |  Free kick from manchester united high in towards the back post matamane with a free header
[5730.08 - 5735.68] P:1838.26 E:0.126854 |  It's deflected against the crossbar. Cavani was there just a couple of yards out coming in at pace
[5736.32 - 5741.44] P:1793.06 E:0.117991 |  It it hit him hit the crossbar bounced out and van dyke cleared. Yeah, I mean
[5741.92 - 5745.20] P:1714.92 E:0.136592 |  It just shows limp all back making sure that the man united don't score
[5745.28 - 5748.00] P:1755.33 E:0.135278 |  I just think they just the pride in not consuming the goal is there to see
[5749.52 - 5754.08] P:1760.62 E:0.131316 |  So the corner into the near post and that is up and headed away for liverpool
[5755.84 - 5760.32] P:1714.73 E:0.135185 |  And uh, and manchester united come back again, but at least two players were in offside position
[5760.32 - 5763.44] P:1698.49 E:0.132745 |  So liverpool have it once again manchester united nil
[5764.16 - 5767.84] P:1821.24 E:0.128804 |  liverpool five is the score here at old trafford and
[5768.40 - 5772.24] P:1822.46 E:0.127624 |  Pakistan on the way to victory with you jonathan agnew they certainly are 27
[5772.24 - 5778.40] P:1727.06 E:0.124103 |  They want from 28 balls and they haven't lost a wicket. I guess it's much much of a power in what you're seeing now 125 for no wicket
[5778.64 - 5782.64] P:1735.82 E:0.128878 |  some terrific batting uh from rizwan and also babaras um
[5782.96 - 5786.96] P:1771.02 E:0.127776 |  And india have been off it today the boleans being poor whereas, uh, parkistan traditionally

[5792.40 - 5796.32] P:1770.45 E:0.130472 |  They need 26 more. Yeah, just in the way that liverpool deserve this win
[5796.80 - 5801.28] P:1818.55 E:0.128367 |  Oleg an assault shot before the match said that manchester united were we're going to come out
[5802.16 - 5805.76] P:1809.77 E:0.129978 |  Right from the start here. They had an early chance that bruno finandez
[5806.32 - 5811.84] P:1775.49 E:0.126909 |  Wasn't able to to get on target with the shot and then the scoring started for liverpool kater
[5812.48 - 5816.64] P:1818.99 E:0.121849 |  Jota and a hat trick for salah. It was four nil at halftime
[5817.36 - 5820.48] P:1782.90 E:0.117795 |  very soon in the second half it was five nil and
[5821.12 - 5823.68] P:1764.74 E:0.127281 |  And manchester united just haven't laid a glove on them deal
[5823.84 - 5826.16] P:1740.12 E:0.131385 |  No, they haven't they've not had the ball for a long time either
[5826.64 - 5831.68] P:1788.64 E:0.133255 |  I mean there was a moment there when liverpool could have broke quickly and trend ali zander tried to break quickly and he didn't
[5831.76 - 5834.16] P:1826.05 E:0.134557 |  And van dyke saying calm down keep the ball
[5836.08 - 5838.08] P:1790.58 E:0.129430 |  Manchester united defending again

[5857.04 - 5860.72] P:1836.36 E:0.130724 |  oxley chamberlain on his left foot. He can't hit them, but that one flies away
[5861.36 - 5866.48] P:1763.51 E:0.132042 |  Wide and a little high of the angle of postman barring behind and into the lower tier of the east stand

[5870.88 - 5873.68] P:1643.90 E:0.138080 |  I mean the job's been done, of course it has in regards goals, but
[5874.32 - 5876.88] P:1651.96 E:0.146176 |  The way that they're managing it the players that I can see
[5877.60 - 5882.00] P:1642.21 E:0.139028 |  Managing their own teammates on the pitch as well trend alexander trying from 30 yards, but
[5882.64 - 5887.04] P:1630.60 E:0.129730 |  Just the organization and the work rates and everything's just spot on from liverpool
[5887.28 - 5889.28] P:1753.50 E:0.130511 |  I've seen nothing from united all day
[5889.52 - 5894.56] P:1836.64 E:0.136332 |  United supporters are trying to make a bit of noise inside the stadium those supporters who are still here
[5894.88 - 5898.80] P:1721.18 E:0.120046 |  What do you reckon the uh, how many united fans do you think are still in the ground?
[5899.20 - 5902.32] P:1757.10 E:0.133827 |  Well, there's got to be at least 15 000 20 000 have gone

[5928.08 - 5933.04] P:1749.75 E:0.126628 |  And jota was stayed down. There's a little bit of concern here. They haven't called for the medical people yet
[5933.68 - 5936.96] P:1809.33 E:0.126887 |  So I think he's going to be okay. Yeah, he's just being helped to his feet
[5937.76 - 5941.12] P:1696.08 E:0.132341 |  He scored the the second goal slid into convert at one
[5943.52 - 5948.80] P:1771.83 E:0.128771 |  And the goals have have all been I mean they've played through manchester united. I think almost all five goals
[5948.88 - 5953.12] P:1703.25 E:0.130865 |  Absolutely. There's been nothing lucky about this before nothing lucky about the goals
[5954.08 - 5956.08] P:1817.78 E:0.102946 |  They've been there for a long time
[5956.40 - 5960.24] P:1657.18 E:0.139599 |  Great day for Liverpool this one of the great days for them
[5962.40 - 5967.84] P:1724.60 E:0.137471 |  And that's why they're singing that song whistles from the home supporters it's all they can do
[5969.28 - 5971.76] P:1749.15 E:0.143945 |  Liverpool playing it forward to alexander arnold
[5974.40 - 5976.40] P:1737.47 E:0.132238 |  With three minutes to play
[5977.60 - 5979.68] P:1829.34 E:0.141630 |  The only thing you can say for manchester united is
[5980.32 - 5985.60] P:1756.45 E:0.127411 |  It hasn't got any worse since salla scored the fifth goal for Liverpool in the 50th minute
[5986.32 - 5987.04] P:1678.49 E:0.107595 |  salla
[5987.04 - 5992.48] P:1744.02 E:0.127425 |  Backs away on the right hand side gets the ball down works it to alexander arnold alexander arnold
[5993.20 - 5995.20] P:1736.34 E:0.123585 |  And then with the outside of his boot
[5996.24 - 6001.84] P:1877.15 E:0.129139 |  Finds henderson centrally henderson scoops one forward kivani slips over on the edge of the box as he chests it down
[6001.84 - 6006.72] P:1791.93 E:0.125316 |  But he found a teammate in red and sure will play it away. They just got that one away to fred
[6007.68 - 6008.72] P:1809.57 E:0.083372 |  Dallow
[6008.72 - 6011.20] P:1712.24 E:0.133023 |  Chips it across for an aldo in the center circle
[6011.68 - 6017.52] P:1702.98 E:0.132984 |  Ronaldo turns lifts it out towards the right hand side, but i'm not sure when bersaq has going to get there is not it's actually caught
[6017.92 - 6019.28] P:1798.45 E:0.107168 |  off the field
[6019.28 - 6020.88] P:1791.84 E:0.110940 |  by
[6020.88 - 6022.72] P:1783.64 E:0.108745 |  by roberton
[6022.72 - 6024.40] P:1749.99 E:0.130314 |  So back it comes again
[6024.40 - 6030.64] P:1767.29 E:0.126529 |  I think the question's got to be asked as well deon whether whether the arrival of the great christiano rinaldo
[6031.76 - 6032.96] P:1673.90 E:0.121160 |  has actually
[6032.96 - 6034.96] P:1715.25 E:0.119378 |  set things off kilter here
[6035.04 - 6039.12] P:1793.43 E:0.142108 |  And listen he scored six goals in eight appearances before today. Absolutely. Is that?
[6040.40 - 6045.68] P:1770.86 E:0.119172 |  As you know, they're doing it back on the halfway line. It is rinaldo square to kivani kivani
[6045.68 - 6051.52] P:1812.51 E:0.112427 |  Then back centrally to mcdomine mcdomine to fred fred outside the box left for the ball across
[6051.52 - 6056.72] P:1741.90 E:0.127419 |  It's behind kivani and they have to trot out towards the far side and in any case he was in an offside position
[6056.80 - 6061.52] P:1800.09 E:0.128467 |  Freak it to love the pool so back to the rinaldo point. Yeah, it's it's you know, it can't be a negative
[6061.52 - 6067.44] P:1779.39 E:0.128976 |  Surely having rinaldo in your ranks, but it his goals have been brilliant his performances
[6068.16 - 6070.16] P:1702.92 E:0.139456 |  When he scored his goals have been brilliant
[6071.20 - 6073.20] P:1770.83 E:0.136431 |  But at the moment united don't look like
[6073.92 - 6079.12] P:1727.73 E:0.131101 |  They don't look like that they're in the same league as they look like they could be in a completely different league with
[6079.12 - 6080.48] P:1706.23 E:0.124374 |  limapool and
[6080.48 - 6082.24] P:1622.90 E:0.119240 |  Chelsea and sitting
[6082.24 - 6086.96] P:1726.23 E:0.121952 |  They look miles ahead of man united on this performance here at old trafford
[6087.76 - 6089.44] P:1737.38 E:0.111654 |  Manchester united
[6089.44 - 6095.04] P:1760.24 E:0.122050 |  Just a couple of minutes away from what will be their fifth defeat of the season in all competitions
[6095.28 - 6100.40] P:1825.46 E:0.120031 |  Their third premier league defeat of the season so they have lost three of their first nine
[6101.04 - 6107.36] P:1730.24 E:0.131307 |  And the debate is going to absolutely rage over oligone solshah's position unless and the club have been adamant about this
[6108.08 - 6110.08] P:1744.82 E:0.139209 |  For a lengthy period of time now
[6110.56 - 6116.40] P:1793.12 E:0.119508 |  That their support for oligone solshah is as they've said many times rock solid
[6117.12 - 6122.24] P:1717.19 E:0.121553 |  But this clearly will test that support and the question will be asked
[6123.20 - 6124.32] P:1822.76 E:0.119162 |  Jurgen Klopp
[6124.32 - 6128.64] P:1769.88 E:0.128635 |  No doubt about his position his roaring start to the season that liable have made
[6129.20 - 6133.44] P:1787.06 E:0.129186 |  Well, they've turned up the volume here with yet another superb away day
[6134.08 - 6136.96] P:1781.39 E:0.137217 |  Things with as well for manchester united. They're already out of the carabao cup
[6137.04 - 6142.72] P:1777.42 E:0.117089 |  So there is a spare week now for manchester united without a game coming up before
[6143.28 - 6145.52] P:1803.14 E:0.118035 |  They go to top them next saturday
[6147.04 - 6152.32] P:1784.81 E:0.136619 |  Nothing looks easy for them at the moment as kivani united concede another three kick
[6153.20 - 6155.20] P:1764.29 E:0.136612 |  Three kick just forward and left to the center circle
[6157.12 - 6159.84] P:1681.76 E:0.134828 |  Sorry, sorry, john. I've just seen mo salami come from the right wing
[6159.84 - 6162.56] P:1705.52 E:0.124323 |  He's gone into the center of the of the pitch into the center circle
[6162.56 - 6167.44] P:1721.62 E:0.117684 |  He's played four or five passes into jordan henerson and jordan henerson has passed them back to him
[6167.68 - 6171.84] P:1659.97 E:0.126591 |  Between them they've had about seven passes and nothing nothing at all from man united player
[6172.32 - 6175.44] P:1717.98 E:0.139317 |  Salah going back to alexander arnold three minutes of added time
[6176.48 - 6178.80] P:1761.55 E:0.128071 |  Get through that quickly enough manchester united
[6179.52 - 6185.20] P:1714.30 E:0.124471 |  And those who are left here and and and many more now they're disappearing in there in their hundreds and thousands
[6185.92 - 6190.24] P:1817.34 E:0.126074 |  One of one of the the worst defeats that manchester united have ever suffered here at old trafford
[6190.72 - 6194.40] P:1834.17 E:0.105371 |  Here's jotter on the left hand side jotter stabs it back to
[6194.88 - 6197.52] P:1690.61 E:0.123722 |  Cristiano Ronaldo a little bit of fancy footwork from him
[6197.52 - 6202.08] P:1700.45 E:0.131075 |  We've seen little and nothing of that today kivani now out to the right hand side van besaker is there
[6202.56 - 6208.40] P:1709.44 E:0.128608 |  This is a rare united attack van besaker crossing takes a deflection man that loops behind for a united corner
[6208.88 - 6214.16] P:1821.15 E:0.134178 |  It was actually our old friend angus lochron has been in touch to tell us it was 10 years yesterday
[6214.80 - 6218.88] P:1794.52 E:0.128069 |  Since the famous six one against manchester city here
[6219.92 - 6225.12] P:1748.29 E:0.134318 |  It's right up there with that or right down there. Yeah from a manchester united point of view. Yeah, it is
[6225.60 - 6228.72] P:1658.83 E:0.137553 |  It really is a really bad day for the fans of manchester united and the players
[6229.04 - 6231.04] P:1790.28 E:0.111977 |  How is he there corner then

[6474.00 - 6479.76] P:1679.67 E:0.126270 |  Urgen clop as well stands with palms apart and now pats his chest as if to say

[6510.40 - 6515.44] P:1772.06 E:0.130586 |  Liverpool have not had it this good against united since 1990
[6516.32 - 6520.88] P:1751.59 E:0.127468 |  When in the team was one of the men sitting about 10 yards to our left hand side
[6521.12 - 6524.24] P:1899.50 E:0.127171 |  Celebrating every goal when it went in he turned 60 this week

[6534.64 - 6538.56] P:1620.90 E:0.133390 |  They're legends. They're proper. They are proper not just liverpool legends. They're footballing legends
[6539.28 - 6547.20] P:1611.79 E:0.121328 |  But to do what this current liverpool side has done today here at old trafford in front of 76,000 fans
[6547.76 - 6551.20] P:1710.70 E:0.141526 |  I mean to embarrass Manchester United in this stadium in the way they did
[6551.76 - 6555.12] P:1767.28 E:0.129304 |  That's it's got to be down to the managers influence on those players
[6555.44 - 6560.48] P:1646.32 E:0.133269 |  How he sets them up the belief that he gives them the professionalism the hard work
[6560.88 - 6565.12] P:1653.35 E:0.115751 |  I can't think hard. I can't speak high enough of liverpool today. They were absolutely brilliant
[6566.08 - 6571.20] P:1786.10 E:0.136459 |  1990 by the way when that four nil victory for liverpool over manchester united happened
[6571.20 - 6576.24] P:1784.36 E:0.129139 |  That was the same year when that famous mart robbins goal saved sir alex bergasson
[6576.32 - 6582.08] P:1802.55 E:0.126154 |  Can anyone save oligunus olsiadeon? I don't know. It's got to be difficult for him after a performance like today
[6582.64 - 6584.96] P:1560.69 E:0.121993 |  Or should I say more so the result?
[6585.68 - 6589.52] P:1728.22 E:0.121493 |  Five five goals at home against your biggest rival in football
[6590.08 - 6594.88] P:1656.09 E:0.136148 |  It's totally embarrassing. I don't know what he's going to say. I don't know what the higher. You're going to say
[6595.36 - 6597.36] P:1683.36 E:0.110821 |  I know what the fans will say though
[6597.76 - 6602.80] P:1845.09 E:0.131232 |  I'm just looking john at the messages. We've been getting on social media from manchester united fans
[6603.20 - 6609.04] P:1841.61 E:0.124567 |  This one time for og has to go not up to the job jack if ollie doesn't get sat tomorrow i'll be surprised barry
[6609.04 - 6615.52] P:1835.44 E:0.121598 |  If I was the glazers i'd walk onto the pitch and hand him his p45 total incompetence. This is disgusting
[6615.92 - 6617.60] P:1936.28 E:0.141073 |  steven as a liverpool fan
[6617.60 - 6624.16] P:1866.15 E:0.122963 |  It's so sad to hear united fans booing a playing legend united have lost something as a liverpool fan
[6624.24 - 6628.72] P:1930.84 E:0.122564 |  It's great, but I know things can change so fast. Well, we've been reading and hearing
[6629.84 - 6635.04] P:1795.86 E:0.120704 |  That the the authorities here are behind solcii, but that can change and fast
[6635.36 - 6640.48] P:1833.84 E:0.129006 |  That's been a consistent line from the manchester united hierarchy that they are rock solid behind ollie gonna solcii
[6640.80 - 6642.80] P:1742.66 E:0.116568 |  and what what he's trying to do
[6643.04 - 6643.76] P:1533.82 E:0.087420 |  and
[6643.76 - 6648.48] P:1715.70 E:0.124785 |  Listen, they've made those those big signings. They backed him massively with the arrival of sancho
[6648.56 - 6653.20] P:1679.09 E:0.117327 |  We didn't come off the bench today and admittedly, you know pogba was sent off so that that
[6654.00 - 6656.88] P:1796.70 E:0.125250 |  Changed things in terms of the the changes that he could make
[6657.52 - 6661.92] P:1715.68 E:0.111721 |  So sancho reynolds and verand who's obviously out injured at the moment
[6662.32 - 6663.84] P:1738.78 E:0.094926 |  we are still
[6663.84 - 6667.52] P:1857.94 E:0.116349 |  In the first couple of months of him having those players available to him
[6668.00 - 6673.84] P:1784.53 E:0.109704 |  But but this this result simply will have to provoke a discussion at the top of this club
[6674.16 - 6678.16] P:1852.43 E:0.121487 |  About whether they still feel that he's the right man for what they're trying to do
[6678.72 - 6684.32] P:1732.91 E:0.137887 |  You know one of the and I hate listen. I hate talking about my earlo and I was here. I was only here for a short while
[6685.36 - 6691.20] P:1743.43 E:0.117146 |  But I seen I seen players when things weren't going right putting it right on the pitch
[6692.16 - 6698.72] P:1797.72 E:0.125594 |  Body language saying something Brian Robson, Roy Keane, Paul, it's players that will take responsibility
[6699.04 - 6702.56] P:1871.73 E:0.126029 |  At 2-0 at 3-0. Yes, you're getting a doing
[6702.88 - 6705.92] P:1855.24 E:0.129968 |  You're getting taken to the cleaners. You're playing against a better team
[6706.32 - 6709.60] P:1852.82 E:0.125780 |  Don't let it continue to the fours and the fives
[6710.16 - 6716.24] P:1838.39 E:0.120718 |  Do something about it on the pitch. I didn't see anything like that today from any players in a red shirt taking responsibility
[6716.56 - 6721.20] P:1803.02 E:0.118013 |  Then basically the they had the trousers pulled down by Liverpool in the first half
[6721.60 - 6723.60] P:1702.94 E:0.130031 |  And in the second half Liverpool just toyed with them
[6724.16 - 6727.60] P:1822.76 E:0.127886 |  It was it was so simple for Liverpool. Listen. I seen Jordan Henderson
[6727.60 - 6733.60] P:1814.76 E:0.120880 |  He must have ran across the the centre the centre circle about 20 times getting it from van Dijk giving it to
[6734.72 - 6737.60] P:1824.67 E:0.140912 |  To whoever he wanted to he had so much time on the ball
[6737.92 - 6741.12] P:1892.76 E:0.110392 |  It was looking up. He had six or seven options. He'd play it. He'd get it back
[6741.20 - 6744.56] P:1899.01 E:0.108861 |  He was dictating the play he was shouting at his teammate Steve
[6745.12 - 6750.88] P:1873.03 E:0.098288 |  With a minute to go get back get back work hard. I can see him from here. I'm thinking
[6751.68 - 6753.68] P:1779.16 E:0.117919 |  That that is the sign of winners
[6754.16 - 6759.20] P:1978.70 E:0.123967 |  And there's also d on the spectre of Antonio Conte being out of work
[6759.20 - 6764.24] P:2010.83 E:0.127074 |  Peter Schmeichel I was reading in the times the other day talking about him saying I'm not sure about Conte
[6764.32 - 6768.88] P:2122.67 E:0.126248 |  He never stays longer than two years. Can you knighted thinking in those kind of timelines?
[6768.88 - 6773.60] P:1911.75 E:0.124531 |  They're going to think months weeks days, haven't they? I mean Steve you got off the we're talking about today's performance, right?
[6773.60 - 6775.52] P:1723.24 E:0.124113 |  And and and and the way it's gone today
[6776.24 - 6781.04] P:1812.80 E:0.140586 |  I don't know where Oli can go. You know as a bloke I like Oli a lot of people like Oli as a bloke
[6781.04 - 6783.04] P:1917.76 E:0.126592 |  But the man United fans don't see Oli the bloke
[6783.36 - 6787.60] P:1865.49 E:0.123950 |  They see the 11 players that go on the pitch and they're seeing performances. They're not happy with
[6788.88 - 6793.04] P:1970.31 E:0.123836 |  What you'll get from Antonio Conte we know this because we know him from Chelsea
[6793.60 - 6794.88] P:1856.24 E:0.124718 |  is that
[6794.88 - 6796.88] P:1885.50 E:0.101951 |  There's every chance he'll bring success
[6797.04 - 6800.48] P:1833.58 E:0.125598 |  And there's every chance that he will get more out of this this
[6801.12 - 6803.36] P:1892.52 E:0.122977 |  very very talented Manchester United squad
[6803.84 - 6807.76] P:1928.48 E:0.104663 |  but what you might get as well is aggravation and and
[6808.80 - 6811.30] P:1973.09 E:0.129312 |  Confrontation confrontation aggravation
[6812.00 - 6815.36] P:2017.76 E:0.116977 |  fallouts and also this would alter
[6815.92 - 6823.68] P:1980.52 E:0.127953 |  that the what Manchester United are trying to do because his history tells us that there's every chance that will be relatively short term
[6823.92 - 6829.20] P:1966.59 E:0.111401 |  So effectively with a manager like that you'd be going back to what they attempted to do
[6829.68 - 6833.12] P:1866.16 E:0.126643 |  With when Jose Mourinho was brought here and we know how what happened there
[6833.76 - 6840.64] P:2020.63 E:0.129194 |  There's a lot of aggravation and confrontation inside old trapper and celebration from the Liverpool fans to our right hand side
