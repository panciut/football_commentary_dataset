  "transcript": " As they play from left to right and our referee is Stuart Atwell. So Pat Nevin, Liverpool have an opportunity here and you'd expect it to be a home banker. Yeah, they're going to have to make sure they get the three points here because I mean it's a nascent league table. But it doesn't look pray how far down that league table Liverpool are just now. So they want to get this one out of the way and they would actually almost hope to put this game to bed. In the first half. But look at the way that Bournemouth has started. Is that back four that you're suggesting? Very intriguing before the game. We had a good look around, didn't we? You thought they might do a backflip, didn't you, Hamon? Henderson was looking for Firmino. At one stage they were warming up with Lerner as part of a back three, but they have switched that formation as Elliot right-hand side sends over across. It's actually headed away by Firmino, picked up by Gomez, overruns it, and a heavy first touch-up is right for it. Takes the ball out of play on this sunny afternoon and out for a Bournemouth throw. Certainly Bournemouth have had a tough reintroduction to life in the Premier League, like Crystal Palace facing three of last season's top six in their opening four games. Yeah, there's mentioned that to Chappell's earlier on, you know, they made a lot of snap decisions early on in the season. It's not a good idea to do that, particularly the transfer window, isn't it, yet? Bournemouth particularly, a really tough start to the season. They would like to be in touch with everyone else at the end of this little period, and then they can get back onto their normal business so the teams that they feel they can get points off. Allison in a light purple goalkeeping outfit and the shadows of the carpour away towards our right. Liverpool in all red, playing from right to left. Robertson in front of the main stand on this left-hand side, now decides to bump forward, spreads it out to his opposite fullback, Alexander Arnold, who now finds the right touch line and it's Salah running on his toes. Elliott plays the ball forward. Robertson is stayed in the attack, might come to Fabinho and into the arms of Travers. It goes as Burton Albion, yet to win in League One, have taken an early lead at the Abbey Stadium in League One. Cambridge United, Nill, Burton, one is a latest score. The goals as they go in around the country as usual, the usual service on this Saturday afternoon on BBC Radio 5 Live. Every Premier League game covered, various reporters out in the championship. We have Derby County, Peterborough and Lake Norrie at Hartley-Pawl in Leagues One and League Two. The Salah's into the penalty area, his attempted cross blocked, comes out to Firmino, chips over the cross. Lewis Giaz with the header and Liverpool inside the opening three minutes lead by a goal to Nill. It was a perfectly waited ball over and Lewis Giaz climbed and headed the ball in. Liverpool won Bournemouthville. It's a brilliant header at the back post. The problem that Bono forgot there is Firmino, places the false nine. He drops back deep, the Salah backs him, not sure who to mark. Eventually Giaz comes out of the back post there. Nice little header, no one near him at all. Love the cross from the left-hand side of their defense and they just didn't cover. Liverpool, they wanted to start fast. Boy of these dark and fast. Well, we were expecting this type of start from Liverpool. It was a lovely ball across from Firmino. They are checking it though. They are checking it, VAR, as they do with everything. So what would that be for? That would be for the offside. There was a build-up in the play before that. There was nothing to make it obvious. That's not going to give reaction from the fans here. Greg Porsen is the VAR. Our little monitor has decided to go on the blink. That's indeed the ball, the other one's a little bit longer. Yeah, I mean, at the time, it will be tight. If Luiz Diaz is offside, it will be extremely tight. Of course, Liverpool suffered against that, against Manchester. I see that second goal, Marcus Rashford on Monday night. The goal stands in Liverpool to lead by Eagleton Hill. Let's get an update from Manchester City, Will Perry. Listen to this in the fourth minute. Crystal Palace are ahead here. They lead by Eagleton Hill. I think it's an own goal. Mark Gay, he was celebrating, but it's a free kick. Whipped him from the right by Eberich Yese. I think it comes off Karl Walker. Anyway, it's in the back of the net, and Palace lead. Well, they do have previous, of course, Crystal Palace at Manchester City. They've been somewhat of a bogey side in recent seasons. Liverpool now centre away with Salah on that right. Salah, right corner of the penalty area to Henderson. Plays it forward, takes the deflection and into the arms of Mark Travers. He's been a very shaky start from that defence from Bournemouth. Travers very early on, quite slow out to come to a ball. We eventually got it, but it was a bit hesitant. And I mentioned to you before, again, with Bournemouth, I would switch and side here, so that Liverpool are not playing their favourite direction. But also Bournemouth, goalkeeper, is getting some right in his eyes. Yeah, not sporting a cap either, but it could be a busy afternoon for Mark Travers. Bearing in mind that they've already lost 3-0 to Arsenal. Manchester City, they were beaten by four goals to nil, and they find themselves already a goal down here at Anfield. Against a Liverpool side with certainly there, a bit between their teeth. So, John Stone's own goal, it's been credited for that palace lead at the Etihad. Liverpool are attacking, Salah enters the penalty area for Meno. Shot comes in, five-shot as well. Harvie Elliott with his first goal in the Premier League, and that's one to remember. He did it distinctively, first time, banged the bottom left hand corner from outside the area, and inside six minutes, Liverpool already lead 2-0. Well, it's an astonishing start. Salah, every team has got the ball, he's just dragged the benders towards him. He leaves gaps in the middle there. When it came out to Elliott, he didn't think twice. He pulled it right beyond the goalkeeper, answered the far forester. Elliott's already had one brilliant through ball, it just didn't make it. What a fantastic start by Liverpool. Cracers almost have let it already. Elsewhere, Walsall-1, Grimsby-0, Harrogate-0, Newport County-1, late Norian leading Hartley-Pull, united by a goal to 0. And in fact, let's get news of that goal from Charlotte Richardson. Late in Norian, oozing confidence here, an early advantage, Curtis is in great work down the right-hand side by Charlie Kelman. He was pulled back by Ewan Williams, the Hartley-Pull defender, doing his best to reminiscrate with the referee, but it was inside the box, and George Moncow is there to step up and convert his second penalty of the season. It's a dream start for the host. It's late in Norian-1, Hartley-Pull-0. Liverpool on the attack, Salah right-hand side. This could be a very, very long afternoon for Bournemouth. We welcome listeners from the BBC World Service, wherever you are in the world. It's always a pleasure to have your company. You join us here at Anfield under the blue skies and the sunshine. And Liverpool already leading Bournemouth by two goals to 0. From a Lewis-Tiasse header after three minutes, and Harvey Elliott is first in the Premier League for Liverpool three minutes later, and Bournemouth really up against it. Pat Nevin. Yeah, you've done so much work during the week in the system. You know, who's going to mark where? Every time they get the ball, Salah's got a chance, but I think he's off. Yeah, the ball's in the back of the net, but the flag was raised. Firmino coming back from an offside position. That'll be a free kick to Bournemouth. And I would imagine very, very soon, in about 90 seconds' time, Anfield will be a venue full of emotion. Of course, the tragic murder of Olivia Corble of nine years of age, murdered in her own home in the Dufkut area of Liverpool, just four miles from Anfield, just like at Tramir, when they played Newcastle United in midweek, the supporters, I'm sure, will just start applauding in memory of Olivia within the next 60 seconds. I would imagine that the Bournemouth supporters will also be joining in with such a tribute. Liverpool here leading 2-0. You're listening to BBC Radio 5 Live, St Mirren lead Hibbs by a goal to Nill and the Scottish Premiership, Lincoln 1, Fleetwood Nill is the latest score, Tramir lead Colchester in league two, and Blackpool have taken the lead at home to Bristol City in the championship. Bristol City have won their last three, find themselves behind at Bloomfield Road. Liverpool lead 2-0, Manchester City are behind. Lourdes Diaz, caught late by Lerner, the referee though will play the advantage as Robertson picks up the ball and drives from midfield out to Alexander Arnal. He finds Salah now on that far side, and it's now with Harvey Elliott. And the ball now, Liverpool on the attack, little bit flat-footed. So we're in the ninth minute here at Anfield. And... Very, very soon. It's actually been very, very quiet in the last few minutes, hasn't it? You know, and I locked it while thinking at this moment. There is a ripple of applause that is starting, and now everybody inside Anfield rises to their feet. We are in the ninth minute. This is in memory of Olivia Pratt-Cobble, tragically leading the game, and Olivia Pratt-Cobble tragically murdered. There are no words to comprehend what's happened. There are no words needed right now. CHEERING The thoughts and prayers are with her family. Liverpool leading here by two goals for Nill. Robertson's ball cut out by Mepham. Picked up now by Firmino. Firmino still doing. Peels for Hanball, cleared away by Smith. Let's get an update elsewhere in the Premier League. We'll go to Brighton. Brighton leads to Hellside. 10 minutes played. Brighton-Nill leads Nill. A very physical start from both sides. Tackles flying in. Brighton just came on the counterattack. It was a good pass from Gross to Wellbeck, on to Trossard, into the area, but it was defended well by Leeds. Brighton-Nill leads Nill. Brentford-Everton, Lee Blatman. Brentford-Nill, Everton-Nill. Brentford on top, though. Hickey's had a shot deflected wide from the edge of the area, and then Mbuehmo should have just scored from 14 yards out. He missed the bottom corner as well. It won't be as gone close for the visitors. Nill-Nill at the moment, though. Remember Manchester City are still behind to Crystal Palace by a goal to Nill. Harrogate-Nill, Newport County too. Wimbledon-Nill, Barrow-1, two of the latest scores. Chelsea Lester, Masparuki. There's just been a penalty court here by the referee, for Chelsea. Ruben Loftus-Cheek brought down in the area. I think we'll have a little bit of delay here while the VAR looks at it, but Ruben Loftus-Cheek with a chance a couple of minutes ago. The best chance yet of the match. Still goalless. Come back to me, and we'll see who takes this penalty. We'll be back with you, Mas. Huddersfield lead West Bromwich, Albion by a goal to Nill. Burton are now down to 10 men. Jimmy Floyd, Hasselbank side. They were leading at Cambridge by a goal to Nill, but they're down to 10 men. What about Manchester City? Any sign of a response at home to Crystal Palace? They've got a corner now, Denner, and Palace have hardly touched the ball since going ahead, but that goal to clear it up, it was a mess from a city point of view. A stone's own goal and as a free kick, a touch off to Brunner, then Walker's shoulder, then the knee of stones past their own keeper, Edison. City trailing palace by a goal to Nill. Van Dyke plays the ball out of his penalty area. Forward to Gomez, you're listening to Five Live and the World Service. Also, you might be listening on BBC Sounds on the app. Just find Radio Five Live and select Listen. The beauty of that, you can always rewind just in case you've missed anything. If you were to rewind it, you'd hear Lewis Diaz's header after three minutes and a fine goal from Elliott three minutes later. Hall are leading Coventry City by a goal to Nill, and it's out of play for a throw. Yeah, they've actually done very well. And Bournemouth to calm the game down a little bit, and it has absolutely calmed down. They no need to get into the game and try and create something for themselves. They've had nothing in the final thoughts so far. Lewis Diaz forward, Neppen caught a little bit there by Lewis Diaz. That'll be a free kick. Let's go back to Chelsea. That penalty, Masferuki. That penalty's been overruled, Ian. One of the Chelsea players was offside in the build-up before Ruben Lochte's cheat was fouled. So no penalty, still Chelsea Nill, Leicester Nill. It's a whole leading Coventry City who are yet to win, bottom of the championship. Earlier, of course, the two results in the Premier League. Southampton Nill, Manchester United won, and Sunderland Nill, Norwich City won. So Norwich goes second. They had lost both of their away matches in the championship. But Dean Smith side moving second into the championship. No other goals elsewhere around the country. And after that blistering start from Liverpool, now they're just sitting back. Yeah, and they can do that, you know, because they'll take the ball at the back. They'll try and draw the opposition onto them. And if they do so, with a back four against that level, it'll go front three. They're almost outnumbered in 34, you know what I mean? So far at the start of this game, I have to say, Salas is one of those days. Every time he gets the ball, the whole place just gasps. We need to see what he's going to do next. Keaton Moore going down and holding his face. He just ran into the back of Gomez. Might have just caught the shoulder of the England international. As he's down at that moment, there's been another goal. It's a goal. This time it's at Stamford Bridge, Masferuki. Nasa... Oh, sorry, yes. Ho-Coventry, Nasa. Ho-Sidi-Wan, Coventry City, Nail. Oscar S-Tapinan from a couple of yards out after a good cross from the right. Ho-Wan, Coventry, Nail. Doesn't help when you've got a Mas and a Nasa, and then you've got buzzing interference in the headphones. It's very hard to hear. However, it's going to look quite... Around here, Big Chorus, Bournemouth have got a free kick in a quite dangerous area. You will cross it into the box and have a chance to attack it. Free kick. Tavernier to take it for Bournemouth. Lerma gets his head onto that as well. Comes then to Ryan Christie, and then the ball just lifts and drops safely into the arms of Alison. And it's distribution, his first class, right down the middle towards Salah. And luckily for him, on the cover was Adam Smith, Bournemouth right back. And that's the problem, really. That's the problem you've got if you're Bournemouth. You're two now down, you're at Anfield. They're wanting you to come onto them. As soon as you do, there's one ball out, and we know that Alison could play our fairly good class. That was 90 yards, almost, to Salah's feet. Tell you what is interesting with Liverpool leading 2-0. It's the first time in eight Premier League games that they've actually opened the scoring. Because for seven successive matches in the Premier League, they've conceded first. So for the first time since the end of April, when they beat Newcastle United by a goal to 0, they've scored first. Of course, since that, and here is Lewis Diaz, they might add another one. As Harvey Elliott takes it on, Harvey Elliott across the face of goal. And then Salah misses a tap and at the far post. If he goes with it with his right foot, he scores. He seems to steer it in with his left, and somehow, if he's got a touch at all, it's gone wide. Look, we know how good Salah's left foot is, an absolute one. But it's no excuse. You've got to go out with your right foot. You're small on there, Ian. You've held up to that with Genius. Harvey Elliott's working alongside Firmino there, and Lewis Diaz. Fantastic on the left hand side. But most Salah, I know you're brilliant. It's a tap and you've got to go with your right foot. And that would be 3-0. He's got a very good record. Against Bournemouth as a shot comes in there from distance, from Lerner, saved by Allyson. And there's been a goal at Millwall in the championship. It is Millwall-0, Reading 1. Reading's fine start to the season continues. It's a headed goal from Nabi Sahr on his debut, arriving at the far post to head pass Bartos Bielkowski. Millwall-0, Reading 1. Liverpool have scored twice inside the first six minutes of a single Premier League game for the first time since March 1996 against Aston Villa. Such was the nature of this fast start here against Bournemouth, leading by two goals to ill. Manchester City still trailing at home to Crystal Palace. Chelsea Leicester is goalless as is Brighton League United and no goals between Brentford and Everton. You're listening to Five Live and the World Service. Wickham-1, Charlton-1 is the latest score in League One. MK Don's leading at Morkham by a goal to ill. And you're up to date with the goals as they go in. As Gomes just caught a little bit late by a sliding Ryan Christie. Middlesbrough are leading Swansea City by a goal to ill at the Riverside. Middlesbrough who are yet to win, drawn three and lost three. Chris Wilderside looking to get their first picture of the season. Sheffield Wednesday leading Forest Green by a goal to ill in League One. And it's now Lincoln City 2, Fleetwood-0 as Kilmarnock-0. Motherwell-1 is the latest score on the Scottish Premiership. The goals as they go in as we go to Brighton and Sahail-Side. 17 minutes played, Brighton-0 leads-0 with a free kick. Loaded in from the right for Brighton. Adam Wentz, they're seven yards out, should have really scored but his header went wide. Brighton-0 leads-0. Millwall-0, Reading-1 is the latest score on the Championship as well. Liverpool lead 2-0, they're on the attack. Salah forward ball, Elliott back to goal, right corner of the area. Back to Salah, inside Alexander-Arnold midway through the Bournemouth half. Out to Elliott with his fair hair stroked inside by Alexander-Arnold. Scoop forward, Henderson's made the run. Salah gets the shot away, tipped over by Travers at the near post. Absolutely, very good play there. Harvey Elliott is phenomenal in this first period again there. But that scoop over the top, I just love that play. Gets the player in and Salah gets up from a great angle. With his right foot, it was goalkeeper Travers who's equal to Liverpool are still looking for that third goal. We'll be going to Watford after the corner kick. In the Championship, Watford and Queen's Park Rangers, Liverpool already leading 2-0, though here on 5-Live, Alexander-Arnold in front of that travelling support at the Anfield road. A little flick there by Henderson at the near post and it's headed out by Zamora. So straight to Vicarage road and Aaron Paul goal. Watford-0, QPR-1 and this is an outrageous goal. Elliott's chair, 30 yards out, has taken a pock shot. It's taken a wicked deflection of Francesco Zearaldi. Daniel back when his flat foot is in the Watford goal. He's sprawled down to his left, couldn't quite keep it up and the ball has nestled into the bottom left-hand corner. Watford-0, QPR-1. 2-0 to Liverpool in the Premier League. Crystal Palace through that John Stone's own goal, still lead at the Etihad. Punt downfield by Gomez, cleared away by Meppen, brought down well by Harvey Elliott. Nice control by Jordan Henderson and a weighted ball for Lewis Diaz who pokes it goalwards. Goalkeeper got the block with his legs, he retreats to his goal line. Lewis Diaz tries to find Elliott and then stepping out of defence there was Lewis Cook just at the right time for Bournemouth. He's having a party out there, Harvey Elliott. He's massive amount of space he's finding between the midfield and the forward lane. No one's picking him up but his touch has been fantastic. What a game he's having. Burnley without a winning four on the championship, leading at Wigan who are unbeaten. Wigan-0, Burnley-1, Lee Blaken is at Brentford. Brentford and Everton, Brentford should be ahead though. Matthias Jensen, 20 yards out, cutting in from the left, Curler towards the bottom corner and it came back off the post with Pickford beaten. Brentford-0, Everton-0. Jordan Henderson plays the ball downfield, he's making his 400th Premier League appearance of his career today. 71 of course for those with Sunderland where he began his career. Sunderland who lost 1-0 at home to a tenoric city in the championship. Liverpool playing here at Anfield from right to left looking to extend their unbeaten home league record to 25 matches in the top flight. As now it's with Van Dijk himself. Bit of a landmark day today, his 200th Premier League career. 67 of course for those with Southampton who were beaten also at home by a goal to nil in the early kickoff by Manchester United. It's got a lot of help there. They've changed the centre-back pair and quite a lot this season already. Van Dijk never moves out of it if he's fit he plays but so far they have not really been tested, not been asked any questions yet. Joe Gomez, his third different defensive partner already. There's been another goal, it's at Manchester City, Will Perry. Well listen to this because Manchester City have absolutely battered Crystal Palace but they're 2-0 down a corner from the right hand side from Eze who whipped the ball in for the free kick for their first goal and there was Wacky Manderson almost on the penalty spot, bullet header, bottom left corner, Palace needs City 2-0. I did that great game last week at St James's Park and during the commentary we were saying well maybe one goal might not be enough when you take the lead against Manchester City and Newcastle then went 3-1 up and Manchester City came back and you're thinking two goals might be enough but certainly makes for an interesting score like... And again the champion before the game with Chappers, saying the smaller clubs they just feel this at the moment, they're having such a goal. They've done Palace. Salah on the attack right corner of the area to Harvey Elliott, the return ball to Salah headed out by Zemura, the left back, Zimbabwe international. Sheffield Wednesday 2, Forrest Green nearly as the latest scorer in League 1, Liverpool are still on the attack. What was it that Jürgen Klopp was talking about in his programme notes? We still have belief, we still have perspective, there is no magic formula, work hard and stick together. Interesting that all the panic about all seven points behind Manchester City, they were to slip up today against Crystal Palace. You don't panic, I mean it's the best idea. I mean they've gone through tens before Liverpool, even in great seasons, they have lows, and it may well be that low comes, you don't know when it's going to come. It's been a quiet start to the season, there have been a couple of little teething problems, but certainly there was no teething problems at the start of this game. They're desperate for a third goal because that would kill their self-control. Yeah, there's a real hunger about Liverpool at the moment, Pat Nevin of course, familiar voice on BBC Radio 5 Live and indeed the World Service here at Anfield with us, as Liverpool have all the possession, out to Salah, Salah with a ball to Firmino. Didn't break his stride, didn't lunge at it, it was just a little bit ahead of him, but it was a teasing low ball in from the right, out for a goal kick, Liverpool 2-0. It's the imagination of Salah at that moment there, on the right hand side, left foot, no one would usually play that ball in that angle, he did Firmino, was inches away. Newport have had a good start in North Yorkshire, Harrogate 0, Newport 3 is the latest score and a goal at Brentford in the Premier League, Leib Leibman. Everton ahead, it's against the run of play, but who cares, Brentford 0, Everton 1, ball over the top, Gordon into the area left side, great finish, a cross goal into the bottom corner and did the travelling, few thousand, enjoy that one. Brentford 0, Everton 1. Of course there's Premier League action during the week, Everton are part of our coverage on Tuesdays. They travel to Ellen Road across the Pennines, that's on Tuesday night, we're back here Wednesday, Liverpool against Newcastle United and on Thursday too, we have another live game for you, Leicester City Manchester United, it's also transfer deadline day, so we'll be on air till 11 o'clock on Thursday night. Liverpool lead 2-0, Manchester City are 2 down at home to Palace, as Elliott takes over far side, down towards the byline, sends over the cross and there's no corner, it was drifting out of play and it goes out for a goal kick, so that's Anthony Gordon, that's only his fifth goal, but he's scored in about 60 odd appearances and yet he's been talked about for 50, 60 million pounds as a player. He's up 10 million clips for every golden score, so that's another 10 today, but he is a fantastic player and certainly he's a player that's going to improve, you don't have that quality and that intelligence, that movement, that understanding, game awareness and get-vide, he's going to be a great player. Liverpool leading 2-0 and here Alexander-Arnold to Fabinho, now with Henderson outside the centre-circle, of course for all the sides competing in Europe, providing the progress in the League Cup third round, there will be no more midweek break for them between now and the World Cup, it's going to feel quite a relentless schedule for all the sides competing in European competition, talking of sides in Europe and the Champions League to boot, Rangers are at home to Ross County and a goal, what a good time. They've just taken the lead after considerable pressure on the Ross County goal, Tillman seeing a shot block for a corner then a second shot, tits around by Glade Law, it fell eventually for John Lundstrom, the man who was ordered off against Hibbs last week and he made the mark, Rangers won, Ross County 0-25 gone. Elsewhere, St Mirren still lead Hibbs by a goal to 0 and at Rugby Park it's Kilmarnock 0, Motherwell 1, Salah right hand side for Liverpool leading 2-0, Elliott growing in confidence, more and more times you see this young man, shifts the ball on the inside, it's only his 12th appearance in the Premier League today as Allyson comes herring out of his penalty area, almost to the edge of the centre circle to get there and puts her out of play for a throw. The difference between Allyson on one side and Travers on the other side, Travers doesn't want to come out of his six yard box in the balls bouncing him out there, whereas Allyson, you know he'd rather play centre forward if he was given a chance, read that brilliantly, had he got it wrong they'd have lost a goal at the very least, he could be a player as well. And by the way, come back to Harvey Elliott just now, when he plays in that kind of right midfield position just behind the St Salah, the understanding between them two is incredible, it really is a delight to watch and every time he's got the ball he's tried to do something, he's lost it once or twice, but that final third at least he makes the efforts. 19 years of age, he's some prospect, some talent, Liverpool lead 2-0, Henderson coming forward, Elliott is ahead of him, he finds him, and then Bournemouth defending very very deep, break up that play, Port Vale, Neil Portsmouth won, is the latest score in league one, Alexander-Arnold now coming forward for Liverpool, then it's intercepted by Keifer Moore, Liverpool win it back, Alexander-Arnold coming forward now, Ernstess shoot, and Blyches, oh and Sussins, what a fine goal from Alexander-Arnold, the crowd wanted him to have a dig, he did just that, right-footed, and Travers given no chance, a Liverpool lead by three goals for Neil, and are cruising to what will be their first win in the Premier League this season. Well first of all, I love the Bill Dominic, Favigno wins the ball back, couple of little one-tours, really nice play in the midfield, to coach Alexander-Arnold, OK Manchester, Dave, get ready for your goal of the month, because that one's in it, full stop, lead-out, top corner, Keifer hasn't got a sniff of it, it's a classic Liverpool, and a classic Alexander-Arnold goal. No chance for Travers, meanwhile, goal at Wattford, Aaron Paul, Wattford won QPR one, equaliser for the home side, it's come through Ken Semmer, who found himself in the box, unmarked plenty of time, and with a gorgeous finish to plant it into the bottom right-hand corner, Wattford won QPR one, there was a squish of the arm from Travers, he was clutching at just thin air. Absolutely, the thing is, you make sure, look, could he have got Hunter, the ball, swarming all over the place there, nothing he could do about that. So, stories elsewhere in the Premier League, Manchester City still trail 2-0, and has now been ascending off at Stamford Bridge, Maseruki. Yeah, still no, no, but Chelsea down to 10 here, Conor Gallagher has been sent off, he pulled back Jamie Vardy when he was off on the counter, the Leicester strike, he was already on a yellow, a silly foul to give away, and he is off. Chelsea, 10-man Chelsea, no, less to no. That, by the way, is the 800th goal for Liverpool under Jurgen Klopp, they lead by three goals to nil, Ipswich are leading Barnsley by a goal to nil in League 1, so the leaders are ahead there, still unbeaten at Portman Road, leading Barnsley 1-0, meanwhile at Ewood Park, Blackburn Stokes, and Pat Murphy. Stoke go ahead deservedly, and Lewis Baker the scorer deservedly, he'd already been fouled by Kaminsky with a curling free kick, this time nobody picked him up 25 yards out, don't they know he's got a good shot on him? He scored from 25 yards right foot, Ian Blackburn nil, Stoke 1. Dean Holden of course in caretaker charge for Stoke City after Michael O'Neill was sacked on Thursday, just one win in six, and of course Alex Neil likely to be the next manager of Stoke who are leading by a goal to nil, as Huddersfield increased their lead against West Bromwich Albion. They've had a disappointing start under Danny Schofield, they've struggled, they've lost four of their first five games, but they're now leading 2-0 in West Yorkshire, and will stay in Yorkshire because rather than lead Birmingham by a goal to nil, also in the championship, Paul Warneside still unbeaten, never pull on the attack leading 3-0. They're looking for more goals, they might get another one, and as soon as they have, the ball just loops into the six yard area, and Roberto Firmino has scored his first goal in 21 attempts at Anfield in the Premier League from close range. Traverse stayed on his goal line, Firmino was alert, Liverpool are sharp, and their battering ball nil. And that is an absolute battering there. Dean Kippen, Bokey bird, I think he thought about it, he was going to come and try and collect it. However, it was a flip cost, there was a deflection when it came out, it came out a very odd angle, but once again it's that partnership over on that right hand side. You've got Sala, he's a long straight earlier, and he just can't do everything I've heard of, but it was a deflection, Kimbanger, Anard Ordan, and of course Firmino. There's nothing that Bokey bird can do when he gets it on the volley, whether it's right, but for now, this could be anything. It could be anything. Middles for two, Swansea City nil, Coventry City have equalised in the championship, whole one, Coventry City one, you're up to date with the goals as they go in, but Bournemouth just looks so fragile. They do, there are lots coming from the right hand side that we mentioned there, we know how good Sala is, they actually get Trent Alexander over there, and Elliot over there, and they're moving as one, they're interchangeable, they've got great belief in each other's ability, and you cannot go close and go two and one with any of those three players, because at least the other ones, they're really good technical play by Nemanja, they put them together. Juliette will be interviewing Jurgen Klopp in sports report later on between five and five-thirty the results and the reaction is always in sports report with Mark Chapman, it's just pointed out, Roberto Firmino three assists and now one goal. Yes, it's a shame for him because he's not got the best statistics as a goal scorer for a centre-fought, but you know he's not just that. Players love playing alongside him because he's such a brilliant team player, but yeah, it's possibly important because remember, you know, it's not for a moment, just a cross-out from Bournemouth, you know, nearly 30 was on the way out, you know, and then there's coming in, what a great answer from him today. Let's get an update from Manchester City, remember the last we heard from Will Perry, they were two-nil down. Same score line, City, nil, Palace two in the same score line that it finished last season, Harlins hit the side netting for City from a tight angle after Foden threaded him through and Decore a long ranger straight at Edison, City nil, Palace two. Liverpool are leading by four goals to nil, Salah, and still they want more. This Liverpool side, Alexander-Arnold, two to Harvey Elliott, ball played back, flat ball in from Alexander-Arnold and the header from Robertson, the left back inside the penalty area, about ten yards out from goal, headed over the crossbar. It's actually getting quite horrible now, every single team that Liverpool go that great onside. They just put it across, there is no way that they can stop it just now. They change the back four, the back five, the back four. I think Square Park has got it out there right now, they've changed it back to back five. They've got to limit the damage now, they're getting destroyed in the back line. Let's get used to the Coventry Corolles there, and that's Premchie. Hull City won, Coventry won, it was a penalty figure, Reina won, Gordon, Gordon stepped up, dispatched the penalty with ease. Hull City won, Coventry City won. You're listening to Five Live and the World Service, Hartlepool United have equalised at Lake Norrie, Lake Norrie won, Hartlepool won, Sheffield Wednesday have got a third, Sheffield Wednesday three, Forest Green nil, and it's now Lincoln two, Fleetwood one in league one. Let's get an update from the cricket, England against South Africa, and South Africa in their second innings of course, Ellie Oldroy. And continuing to frustrate England's bowlers, they're 141 for three, so they're 123 behind now South Africa. Peterson 42, Van Der Deusten 41, the partnership's 87, we haven't seen a wicket since the lunch interval, there's only five minutes to team. Coventry continues on Five Live Sports Extra, Cambridge have equalised at home to Burton who are down to 10 men of course. Cambridge won, Burton won, Liverpool lead four nil, that was a late challenge on Henderson, it's going to be a free kick. I told you that Hartlepool have equalised at Lake Norrie, news of it from Charlotte Richardson. Yes, an absolutely sublime goal, Chappers. Wesley McDonnell not taking one touch, not taking two, but taking three, able to navigate his way into the area to place the ball beyond Lovens Vigaroo in the late in Norrie. And I think it's safe to say Richie Williams had a few words to say to the referee, Orient did have quite a good penalty shout down the other end, but Hartlepool were not worried about that, they fought their way back into this game, that fighting spirit that their manager wanted. Orient won, Hartlepool won. Mark won't be happy about that really, we've been called Chappers. That is the biggest smile in my face today. You and Chappers are very alike, you have two T's in that point. Both spelt, I think you'll find. Here is Salah, linking it with Firmino, Firmino's cross blocked. Plymouth won, Bolton won to Rosnill, Barnes lead equalised at Portman Road, Cross comes in from Alexander Isle. Another goal at Watford, Aaron Paul. Watford won QPR2, this is a lessen in-counter attacking football, Kenneth Powell down the right hand side, he got to the bar line, pulled the ball back and found Chris Willick who lashed the ball into the near post. What for one QPR2? I think we're just morphing into each other these days, I think Mark called John Murray George on the Monday night club this week. I do listen to you Mark, you do sound like an old Mario puppy. No exaggeration, Liverpool look like scoring every time they come forward. I know, that's what I was saying, if you're four now down, all the players are looking around each other, defensive ball, they're saying look, we can't stop this, we're getting destroyed in the wide areas. They're going ball, they're going down the left hand side very much, Liverpool. If they do that, they could create even more chances. So if you're on that pitch, you're almost thinking, I want to change it myself. One of the midfielders, fall right back and give it a little bit of cover. It's not happening, they're very open and I'm amazed the scouting part of the park doesn't change this at halftime. The fournil down, they do have a throw on that left hand side and Zamora delivers a low cross, which is swept away in front of the cop by Van Dyke, controlled well by Salah. Firmino then was stopped by the challenge that came in from Sennice, the summer signing four year deal from Fiannaud, the Argentine international, as Bournemouth then flash a shot that just goes wide. Eppert coming in. Well he's suggesting it was saved by the goalkeeper, but he had a fatic reaction, he's had that suspect it was saved by Alisson there. Liverpool were wanting a few kick there, 30-brothered them with his arm, I thought it was much better. The VAR might have looked at that one, but did the goalkeeper save it? Gone out for a goal kick, the shot that was coming in from Ryan Christie, that was off target, Liverpool lead by four goals to nil, no other goals to tell you about elsewhere around the country, so we'll get an update from Brentford Everton, Lee Blaken. Brentford nil Everton won, but Brentford have hit the post for a second time, this time from a Tony header and then viscified over the rebound from eight yards. How Brentford haven't scored in this game, I don't know, Brentford nil Everton won. West Bromwich Albion have got a goal back in the championship, how does it feel town two West Bromwich Albion won? Memo to self, invoice BBC Radio 5 Live for Mark Chapman's work this Saturday afternoon. In fact changed that Mark Chapman's work throughout the whole year. Don't be better. I've just said we've got people who may be slightly worried this afternoon, Rangers fans are probably quite happy, they've done very well. They've drawn Liverpool in the Champions League, don't watch the first half this. If you do, on matchday tonight, do it from behind the sofa. All the Champions League coverage you can hear on BBC Radio 5 Live, not this week, the week after. Liverpool travel to Naples to take on Napoli, and Rangers of course in Liverpool's group will travel to Amsterdam to face Ajax, those fixtures were released today, if you haven't yet seen it, you can check out the BBC Sport website. Brentford, Neal Everton won, Brighton, Neal leads, Neal, Chelsea down to 10 men, still drawing at home with Leicester City, Neal, Neal, and Manchester City, Neal, Crystal Palace two of the latest scores in the Premier League, earlier Southampton, Neal Manchester United won, and in the championship, Sunderland, Neal Norwich won. Luz Dias, Liverpool leading four, Neal here, four goals scored in the opening 31 minutes. We had two in the opening six minutes spell, and then another two in three minutes after 28 and 31. Elliot plays in the cross from the right, cleared away by Bournemouth, back to Stamford Bridge, Maz Feroci. Still no, no, but Leicester have had the ball in the back of the net from a corner. There was a scramble in the box though, Mendy went down, free kick was given, the goal ruled out, but not a confident moment from the Chelsea keeper again. 10 man Chelsea, no, Leicester, no. Goal kick to Bournemouth. It will be interesting looking at, we've not seen any of the footage, but Chelsea, another man sent off with a shirt tug, which is extraordinary. What's happening in that club at the moment, since something Thomas Tuchel has to look at. Statistics from up to Joe, Liverpool have scored four goals inside the opening 31 minutes. The earliest they've netted four times in a single Premier League game since 2014 against Arsenal. Five live and the World Service. We've got five minutes to go at a half time. Liverpool leading by four goals to Neal, Leighton Orient, the Leake two leaders are back in front, two-one at home to Hartley, Paul United, who are yet to win under Paul Hartley. Let's go back to Manchester City, will Perry. Well, it's still City, Neal, Palace two and Fodensterns to stuck an unmarked header onto the roof of the net from six yards out, really should have scored. And City find themselves two-nil down inside the first 20 minutes of a home Premier League game. For the first time since December 2010, that was against Everton, they lost that City, Neal, Palace two. Thanks Will, Liverpool leading four-nil, Salah right-hand side, Alexander-Arnold gets the ball back from Elliott, looks up, delivers the cross, it's a deep one, Henderson will keep it alive, left-hand side of the penalty area, pops it up to Louis Dias, takes it quite high on the chest, comes out to Henderson, but Liverpool just, they're in first gear here, leading four-nil. Henderson and Louis Dias has a, tries to get away from the attentions of Jadon Anthony, now delivers the cross, picks out Alexander-Arnold, comes on the inside, doesn't shoot, plays it to Harvey Elliott instead, delivers the cross, turned behind for a corner kick, Liverpool still lead four-nil, will go back to late Norian, Charlotte Richardson. It's late Norian two, Hartley poor one, it didn't take long for Orient to get back ahead, he won the penalty earlier and Charlie Kellman with a fine confident finish from the outskirts of the area, but restores Orient's advantage, Orient one, Hartley, sorry, Orient two, Hartley poor one. It's the time for a fifth goal for Liverpool before half-time, corner kick, far side the right, attacking the Anfield road end, in it comes now, it's an in-swinger, comes out to Salah, and Salah, left-footed off target, goal kick. Another goal at Ibrox, Roddy. Pat Nevin was saying Rangers fans shouldn't watch the Liverpool first half, maybe some Liverpool fans shouldn't watch Rangers, taking goal Antonio Cholak, the man who was the hero against PSB, with a magnificent full-blooded volley overhead into the far corner of the net, Rangers two, Ross County nil. Should be an interesting game that one, Roddy, I'm looking forward to it myself. Cambridge one, Burton two, so the ten men of Burton have come from behind and are now leading at Cambridge in league one by two goals to one, no, in fact they were one nil up weren't they, but they're down to ten men, to Cambridge one, Burton two is a latest score. I'm talking earlier on there about that right-hand side for Liverpool, and they're having such joy, and there are three great players there, but you've got to do something to stop it, and at the moment, there's just no movement in that left-hand side of the Bournemouth defence, they've got to be given some help, but having said that, I think you could call to look at it and think, I've found three here that can work together brilliantly, and even if you've done extra play over there, it's probably hard to stop them anyway, but he's got to try it in the same time. By the way, perfect text there on Radio 4. Who's growing? Who you going to next? Talking of Radio 4, Test match special of course, it conjures up lots of images, and a voice you know very well, Ely Oldroy, Tia The Cricket. Yes, 141 for three South Africans, so they've gone through the afternoon session without losing a wicket, but Rassie van der Doest, and lucky to still be there, there was a ball which went so close to the edge of the bat, nobody appealed, it was not given on the field, but the replay showed that he got a touch to it, it would have been out caught behind, but van der Doest in 41, Peterson 42, they put on 87 together, they batted really well. 141 for three South Africans at T, 123 behind. And in the Scottish premiership Livingston are down to 10 men, Jack Fitzwater's been sent off at Pertodry, Aberdeen Nill, Livingston Nill, but Livy are down to 10 men, Bournemouth here, 4-0 down on the attack, Cross comes over from the right-hand side, Jaden Anthony, Tavernier inside to Christie, side on to goal, loses the ball in the penalty area, Bournemouth now have left themselves open, and it's with Salah over the halfway line, Firmino and Lewis Diaz ahead of him, diagonal ball inside, central area, Firmino running forward, not challenged, Firmino shoots, takes a deflection, forced to save out of Traverse, tips it behind, low for a corner. I don't think he caught it absolutely clean, but it was going towards the corner, keeping out to save it there, and again it's a problem at Bournemouth, they've tried to play four or five men forward there, for the first time in about 10 or 15 minutes, and then as soon as Livy pulled break, Salah is late, and you know they're going to get a shot on target at the end of it, this time for once Traverse is able to save. Aberdeen have taken full advantage against the 10 men, they now lead Livingston by a goal to Nill, Hull City in the championship lead, Coventry City 2-1, you're up to date with the goals as they go in, in the Premier League, Brentford Nill Everton 1, Brighton lead United Nill-Nill, as is Chelsea Leicester, Gallagher though sent off for the home side, Manchester City Nill, Crystal Palace 2-4-0 here to Liverpool, corner kick near side the left, Robinson to take it, header comes in, and Virgil van Dijk on the end of it, 12 yards out, plans his header past Mark Traverse, right on the strobe of half time, Virgil van Dijk, and to fifth goal, Liverpool are running riot, 5-0. Yeah, van Dijk, I mean he is absolutely brilliant in the air, and the thing is, somebody's got to make some sort of effort to put him off, no one dead, planted on his head, and it was never going to go anywhere else, with just about a half time, it's 5-0, and it is in no way flattering to Liverpool that it is 5-0 just now, as you say, this could be anything if Liverpool decide to keep on going at this time, to keep on going at this level for the second half. He's never lost a Premier League game in a Liverpool shirt for almost 5 years at Anfield, and that statistic is certainly not going to be challenged today, so it will be a question now of 55 wins after today, and 12 draws during his time, which is an incredible fact really, look at it, Virgil van Dijk, and talking of nearly 5 years, it's 5 goals for Liverpool now, Liverpool 5-0, let's get an update from Hull, and that's Premji. Hull City 2, Coventry City 1, Oscar S-Tepin, and a couple of yards out after Simon Moor's error in the away net, Hull 2, Coventry 1. Stoppage time here at Anfield, the thing is as well, it could have been so many more. Yeah, as I say, it's in no way flattering to Liverpool, the frightening thing is, I think there's another gear, I actually think there is another gear for Liverpool, they've been playing that well, they've taken their foot off the gas a couple of times, just drawing Bournemouth on a little bit, so there seems to be nothing Bournemouth could do at him, I've said it a couple of times now, but I'm just so surprised that they've not adapted it, you lose 2 or 3 goals earlier on, okay, you adapt it, you kill the game a little bit, you haven't done so, and they are getting destroyed every single time that Liverpool Reds go to water. Bristol City have equalised at Blackpool, Blackpool 1, Bristol City 1, Wigan have got a goal back and the Championship Wigan 1, Burnley 2, and it's Harrogate Mill, Newport 4, a latest scoring lead 2. Well Liverpool, Lewis Diaz header after 3 minutes, Elliott's first goal in the Premier League, 3 minutes later, Alexander-Arnold, a lead to a fine effort just before half-hour, Firmino from close range made it 4-3 minutes later, and then a Virgil van Dijk header on the stroke of half-time, Pat Nevin. Yeah, they're a joy to watch Liverpool when they play like this, they've got 5 goals, do the same in the centre, the Cadizio get 4-5 as well, lots of brilliant performances, Salah from the first moment was prepared, but Harvey Elliott, he's just taken it from me, him working with Salah and Alexander-Arnold have been unstoppable. And Sutton 1, Mansfield Mill, a latest score in lead 2. So half-time, Liverpool 5, Bournemouth Mill. I think we should have sent you to Manchester City. Easy in hindsight. Well Rob Green called himself captain hindsight earlier, so yeah, very easy in hindsight. Manchester City losing 2-0 to Crystal Palace at the moment, half-time whistle hasn't gone there yet, Sheffield Wednesday have just got a 4th at home to Forest Green, all different goal scorers for them this afternoon, but Lee Gregory has got the 4th, the half-time whistle has gone at Brentford and the home side of Lee Blakeman will wonder how they're behind. Absolutely Mark, it's been really, really lively this, Brentford have been on top for the most part, but Everton have the game's only goal, Anthony Gordon not letting the Chelsea speculation effect him, getting on the end of a ball over the top from Connor Cody, great assist, really tidy finish as well from Gordon into the bottom corner. Brentford as you say, must be scratching their heads walking down that tunnel, wondering how they've not got at least one, because Jensen and Tony have both at the post, Hickey and Burmo have both had very near misses, but you know the cliche Mark, it's goals but count, Brentford and Neal Everton won at the break. And Leicester could very well be scratching their heads as well at the bridge, Maz. Yeah, ten-man Chelsea no, Leicester with a really good chance in stoppage time, Cucarrea blocked it, he's still on the pitch now actually requiring treatment the Chelsea defender, but I wonder what Thomas Tucar was raiding in from the stands about that first half, a heads in his hand moment certainly when Conor Gallagher already on a yellow naively fouled Vardy when the Leicester man was off on the counter, you simply cannot do that one on a caution, he knew was off before Paul Tierney pulled out the card, that's two players sent off for two bookable offences in consecutive games now for Chelsea, before the red card a great chance for Loctas Cheat that was blocked, Rhys James after the red card, Chelsea's brightest player had a shot rebound off the woodwork, at the other end as well Vardy's had a really good chance as well, Leicester though with a goal ruled out as well for a foul on Mende, so it's all been happening here but Chelsea no, Leicester no. Bottom two in league two, a meeting at Spotland this afternoon on the stroke of half time, Crawley have taken the lead at Rochdale through Jack Powell, Rochdale bottom, they've lost all five so far this season in the league, goal is at Brighton, Sahel Sahi. Yeah Brighton no, leads no, Mark physical game, lots of tackles and high tempo pressing but it's Brighton who caused the problems, Adam Webster head a wide from seven yards and Solly March denied twice by Mellier the leads goalkeeper, leads contribution so far, three yellow cards and lots and lots of niggly fouls, half time Brighton no, leads no. Halifax are bottom in the national league and they've fallen further behind at home this afternoon to Knox County, they've got a second on the stroke of half time, Deja Vu Will Perry? Yes Manchester City nil, Crystal Palace two, City have been completely dominant but trail to a stones own goal after four minutes and Eze free kick took a touch off Dubruner then Walker shoulder then the knee of stones past their keeper Edison, all City but no shots on target, Palace hardly had a touch and then another set piece, Eze's corner met by the head of Anderson who from 12 yards unmarked found the bottom corner, they've fallen and fallen and both come really close but at the breakchapers Manchester City nil, Crystal Palace two. In the logisle game Bruna Fernandez got the only goal of the 90 minutes as Manchester United won at Southampton by a goal to nil, into the Scottish Premiership range as Good Week continues Roddy. Yes indeed they're two nil up against Ross County at half time although they looked a little laggy after the midweek exertions against PSV which took them into the same Champions League group as Liverpool of course, eventually after 20 minutes they go underway, Tillman seeing two fine efforts blocked and then John Lundstrom from 22 yards with a shot that took a little deflection into the net and then Antonio Colac the man of the moment, the man who scored against PSV this time with a spectacular overhead volley and that is what makes it two nil at half time but it should be three James Tavaneer heading off the crossbar. Elsewhere Aberdeen lead ten man Livingstone by a goal to nil, it's Kilmarnock nil, mother well won and Szemiren lead Hibbs by a goal to nil at the end of the first 45 in the championship earlier Sunderland who are going to lose their manager Alex Neil to Stoke were beaten one nil at home by Norwich. Let's start our three o'clock roundups at Vicrid Road Aaron Paul. What for one QPR two what started a touch drab mark has actually turned into quite the contest. Elise Chair broke the deadlock as his long range effort took a wicked deflection off of Francisco Sierra Alta. The home side equalised though, Ken Semmer with a delicious finish opening up his body from close range. Watford went close again then, Ja Pedro hitting the crossbar from long, long distance with Sene Dieng Maas off his line but it was QPR who grabbed a second on the counter. Kenneth Powell supplying at the at the bar line for Chris Willick with a cracking finish. The natives are not happy at the break it is what for one QPR two. And what we expect to be Alex Neil's new team are ahead of the break Pat Murphy. He's watching he'll be impressed the one nil up they deserve it. Rovers booed off the park at the end all they offered was Dak a little chip that was followed by a great covering save by Bonham. The rest of the half has been dominated by Stoke. They haven't mastered Baker. Curling free kick from him poured away by Kaminsky then he wasn't picked up Ramford midfield 25 yards out. Nobody got on top of him and Kaminsky also should have done better with the shot. Rovers nil Stoke won. Well we did try to warn you Laura. We did. Unfortunately it's Cardiff nil Preston nil. Don Southall look away. We had this one down as a goalless draw on paper and Steve Morrison in his technical area has been puffing his cheeks. Frustrated at Cardiff's lack of creativity in the final third. The home side dominating but Preston maintaining that strong defensive record. At halftime it's Cardiff nil Preston nil. And Reading continue to confound their critics Paul Scott. Yeah they're doing well. It's Millwall nil Reading one at halftime but in truth this is not a great game for the neutral. The only goal of the match coming in the 14th minute. Nabi Sa on his debut with a header at the far post. We've had one shot on target for Reading. One shot on target for Millwall. That was in the third minute. Tom Bradshaw's header comfortably saved by Joe Lumley. The truth is neither side really are creating much. But halftime it's Millwall nil Reading one. Let's get to Naz Premji at hole. Hull City two. Coventry City one. The home side lead thanks to a brace from their new hero in East Yorkshire. Columbian Oscar Estapinan. The first after Louis Coyle's cross come shot was spilled. And his second when Simon Moore the Coventry keeper couldn't handle a routine cross a yard out. The Columbian couldn't miss that six in six now for him. Coventry briefly level through Matty Goddard's penalty as it stands hull up to third. Hull City two. Coventry City one. Elsewhere in the championship it's Blackpool one. Bristol City one. Josh Boller put the home side ahead with his second of the season. Tommy Conway got the equaliser five in all competitions for him now this season. Huddersfield lead West Brom. Two one at halftime. Fast senior Andrew got both goals for Huddersfield. Jed Wallace their summer signing at the Hawthorns has pulled one back. Huddersfield two. West Brom one. Middlesbrough yet to win this season. They've drawn three. They've lost three. But the lead swante by two goals to nil at halftime. Riley Mcgregor the first. Matt Crooks the second of the season. Doubling the lead. Rotherham lead Birmingham by a goal to nil thanks to Richard Wood. And it's Wigan one Burnley two. Burnley went two nil up thanks to J. Rodriguez. And Josh Brownhill with his third of the season. Wilkeen has pulled one back for Liam Richardson side from the penalty spot. And that's two for him this season. Our featured game in league one is at Pride Park. Chris Coles. Derby nil. Peter Brunil. Phrenetic start chances are plenty mainly for Derby. Louis Sibley twice and Tom Barcois in with decent opportunities. The opening ten minutes a microcosm of Derby season to date. Create, create, create but can't stick the thing in the net. Peter Brunil came back into things. Johnson Clark. Harry's missing their best chance. A swiveling turn and shot from the edge of the area. And in first half stoppage time another glorious Derby chance. Spurned Barcois and firing straight at the goalkeeper from close range. Signs are good for goals in the second half. Haven't had any in the first though. Derby nil. Peter Brunil. Elsewhere in league one. Accrington nil. Exit nil. Bristol nil. Bristle Rovers nil. Shrews brunil. It's Cambridge United one. Burton two. Burton were one nil up through Gasana. Had me second of the season. They then had John Smith sent off in the tenth minute. That's their second red card this season inside the first ten minutes of a game. Cambridge United did equalize through Sam Smith but Burton retook the lead. Through John Braeford and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbank side who are bottom of the table with just one point lead at the break despite being down to ten. It's Cheltenill. Oxford nil. Ipswich one. Barnsley one. Conor Chaplin's third of the season putting the home side ahead there. Lincoln lead fleet were by two goals so one Teddy Bishop has got both the Lincoln goals. So three for the season for him now. Morkham nil. MK Donnes two. They've lost both their away games of MK Donnes. The 22nd in the table but the lead today. It's Plymouth one. Bolton nil. Niall Ennis got that two for the season now for him. Port Vale nil. Portsmouth one. Sheffield Wednesday four. Forrest Green Rovers nil. And Wickham and Charlton a level one all. Let's find out how the league two leaders are doing. Charlotte Richardson. At the break, it's Orient two. Hartley Paul one. The tone was set when unbeaten Orient were awarded a penalty after just two minutes. Charlie Hellman hauled down in the area. George Moncour stepped up to score his second from the spot this season. And despite their dominance, Orient surrendered their lead when Wesley McDonald showed great composure to round both his marker and the keeper to slop the ball home. The host regained their advantage when Kelman slipped through the Hartley Paul backline to produce a fine confident finish from a difficult angle. He made it look easy, but trust me, it wasn't at the break. The lead leaders have the advantage. It's late in Orient two. Hartley Paul one. Elsewhere in league two, AFC Wimbledon nil. Barrow one. They're in third. Barrow, Josh Gordon got the goal. He's got four for the season now. It's goal is between Bradford and crew and Carlisle and Gillingham. Newport have had a slow start to the season. Only got their first win in the league last weekend, but they've had an amazing 45 minutes at Harrogate. They lead by four goals to nil. Omar Bogle's got two of those that takes him to five for this season. As you've heard late in Orient, lead Hartley Paul one. Goal is between Northampton and Doncaster. Crawley scored on the stroke of half time to lead bottom of the table. Rochdale by a goal to nil. Salford nil, Stevenage nil. Stockport nil, Swindon nil. Sutton lead Mansfield by a goal to nil. Tramira one nil up on Colchester and Warsaw League Grimsby by a goal to nil. Thanks to Danny Johnson, seventh of the season in all competitions in the National League. Borenwood nil, Altrincham one. Bromley are down to 10 and a goalless with Scunthorpe. Southend lead by a goal to nil at Eastley, bottom of the table. Halifax nil, Knox County two. Gates head nil, Wildstone one. Maiden head nil, York one. Goal is between Maidstone and Torquay. Solihull Morsley dorking two nil and dorking a down to 10 in that game. And it's Yoval one, Dagenham and Redbridge nil. In the Scottish championship this evening, this afternoon, Hamilton nil, Arbroath nil, Inverness nil, Morton nil, Partaker two on up at home to Wraith and Queens Park lead co-rangers by a goal to nil. In league one, Allowa three, Peterhead nil, Dunfermline nil, Adrianians nil, Folkirk two, Queen of the South nil, Edinburgh one, Clyde nil and Montrose one, Kelty Hart nil and in league two, Albion Rovers one, Anand one, Bonnyrig rose one, Stirling nil, Elgin are a goal up at Dunbarton, Forfar nil, Stenhouse Mjord two and Stranra two, East five one. In the Rugby Championship earlier, Australia beats South Africa 25-17, Argentina won 25-18, away to New Zealand. They're at T at the second test in South Africa, 141 for three in their second innings, trailing by 123 runs. And in the hundred, it's London spirit, Oval Invincibles today. The women are first up and the spirit are 29 for three in their innings. Exactly four o'clock. Here's the latest BBC News. Listen on BBC Sounds. This is BBC Radio 5 Live. With the BBC News for 5 Live, I'm Carl Hartley. The government has made it clear it will not announce a fresh package of support for people struggling with energy bills until after a new Prime Minister is chosen. Calls for immediate assistance have grown since the announcement yesterday of an 80% rise in the energy cap from October. Police in Liverpool have issued a fresh appeal for any information about the killing of nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Cawble, who was shot at her home earlier this week. Two men aged 33 and 36 have been arrested on suspicion of murder. The UK is sending underwater drones to Ukraine to clear its course lines of mines in an effort to help the flow of grain to the rest of the world. Downing Street has accused Moscow of weaponising food by destroying Ukrainian agriculture and blockading the country's Black Sea port to prevent shipments. Aid agencies say the floods sweeping Pakistan are turning into one of the worst disasters the country has ever faced. Hundreds of thousands of people have lost their homes and livelihoods. There's more on the BBC News website. BBC Sounds. My castaway is the singer and songwriter Adele. I was like, I just need to do something normal. Bono. I've been known as Bono since I was 14, 15 years old. Kate Moss. I get comfortable after the first picture. Well-known faces telling unknown stories. This is excruciatingly embarrassing. I'm a sad person and I don't always know why. It reminds me of every happy moment. Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne. Listen first on BBC Sounds. This is Five Lives Sport with Mark Chapman. It's just a reminder of the Premier League scores then earlier Manchester United beat Southampton by a goal to nil. Everton are one up at Brentford. It's Brighton nil, Leeds nil, Chelsea are down to 10. Conagallagher sent off and a goalless with Leicester. Manchester City nil, Crystal Palace 2 at the Etihad. And at Anfield where they're about to get back under way. Liverpool 5, Bournemouth nil. Here's Mark. Thank you, Ian. It's just wrong, isn't it? Mavio Carvello is coming on to replace Harvey Elliott. Liverpool making a change at the start of the second half. And Bournemouth have made a change as well. They've brought on Phillip Billing into their midfield. Just looking at it, I think it's Jayden Anthony who is the player who has gone off as we are back under way. And Liverpool leading by five goals to nil. Yes, we'll still give you as much commentary as you can. But we're obviously going to keep you busy with the other stories that are around, not just in the Premier League, but notably of course at the Etihad, where it's still Manchester City nil, Crystal Palace 2, Chelsea down to 10 men drawing with Leicester City nil nil. And lots of other stories as well, as we'll keep you busy on this Saturday afternoon before sports report. So Liverpool all in red, playing from left to right, already in front of the Cop. Alexander-Arnold delivers across, Henderson with a knock-down header, cleared away by the Bournemouth defence, only as far as Salah, and it was Gomez who hits the ball in. So this scoreline already equals Bournemouth's record Premier League defeats. And it just comes in at another one. Cross came in from the right by Alexander-Arnold, and it was an outstretched leg by Chris Meppen. He was conscious of the presence of Luis Díaz. It will go down as a Bournemouth own goal, the worst possible start to the second half. Bournemouth conceding more goals, it is going to be a record Premier League defeat for them here today. Already Liverpool are leading 6-0. Just watching, you know, the cheese assistant there, I was going to say that's really sensible, they went 5-4-1. They're going to try and keep it really tight for the first, never got the phrase out, and the ball's in the middle there. And again, there's a lot of pressure at the back. Do you know what Trent Alexander-Arnold does? He puts it in that dangerous area. Question mark about offside, I think they will check that though, but in the defender puts it in his own goal there, to be honest. It's a good finish, sadly, for the wrong side. But they will check it. There may be a question mark running in beside him, in right behind him, Luis Díaz might have been offside. They could never look. They have a test of the ball, but you know. No, yeah, VAR having a look for a possible offside. So that once again is down to Craig Pausen. There are no other goals to tell you about, just as yet early in the second half. But there has been a goal at Stamford Bridge, Masferuki. A first in Chelsea, colours for Raheem Sterling. Chelsea won, Leicester City nearly took a deflection, as it went past Danny Ward in the Leicester goal, into the top right-hand corner, but it counts 10 men, Chelsea won, Leicester Niel. What doesn't help is that on the monitor that we're looking at, because of the sunshine and the shadows of the cop, very, very hard to actually pick out what they're looking at from the offside. Well, it's impossible for us to see, but I'm sure it is. Díaz at the back post there and whether he was involved. They're looking at a secondary angle now, if they're looking at a secondary angle, then, well, shouldn't be a problem. I still think the primary angle was a problem. They're taking the time. Goal stands. Goal stands. He's had a look at that, has Craig Pausen. It's Liverpool 6-4, Mathill. And we're getting close to what would be Liverpool's record Premier League win. That was 7-0 against Crystal Palace in December 2020. And, of course, the overall biggest win in the Premier League, the Premier League is 9. And the way that Liverpool have played today, you wouldn't rule that out, Pat. No, you absolutely wouldn't rule that out. And the fact that there's so little confidence in the defence, that they're up against just now. And, of course, the small matter, they're actually shooting into the cop now. There's been a wicket at the cricket. Yes, we answered the whole afternoon session without one. Just after T, Ben Stokes, the captain, strikes to remove Rassie van der Doestern. He's been playing with an injured finger, van der Doestern. He's done really well. 87 they put on for this fourth wicket, but he is out. And we all see a tumble of South African wickets now. 141 for four, they trail by 123. Commentary continues on Sports Extra. Regular updates with Ellie throughout the course of the afternoon. Five live in the World Service here in the sunshine at Anfield. The early kick-offs, the results have Hampton Nill, Manchester United won, Wendell and Nill, Norwich City won. Latest scores in the Premier League, Brentford, Nill Everton won. Brighton and Leeds United remains goalless. Chelsea lead, Leicester City by a goal to Nill, despite being down to 10 men. And still Manchester City, Nill, Crystal Palace too. As the ball is played out to that far side, the left, four Liverpool. A run through the two teams for you. Allison in goal, a bat four of Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, van Dijk and Robertson. Midfield three of Henderson, Fabinho and Carvalho. And a front three of Salah, Firmino and Luiz Diaz. Bournemouth are all in black, they have Travers in goal, Smith, Senna C, Meppen and Zamora at the back. They have Tavernier, Lermac Cook and Billing with Christie and Kiefer Moore. Liverpool leading Bournemouth by six goals to Nill. Liverpool on the attack, Luiz Diaz with a cross over the head of Carvalho. Luiz Diaz with the delivery, comes out to Alexander-Arnold, low ball in, loops up in the air, Bournemouth on the stretch, eventually getting the ball away to Brighton Sahel Sahi. Still Brighton, Nill leads Nill, four minutes played in this second half, but good work from Brighton, good start to the second half, down the left hand side and Gross was just wide about six yards away. One of these sides could go top at 5pm if they win Ian. Brighton Nill leads Nill. Stockport County Nils, Swindon one is the latest score in League two. The results and the reaction in sports report with Mark Chapman. And at 5 o'clock, Luiz Diaz has done wonderfully well. Pimino across the face of goal, that must have just shaved the far right hand post. Liverpool close to a seventh, but of course the story will be at the Etihad, will Perry. Tavernier now puts it across, it's Harland who looks to get to the ball first and it's a good touch from Gayhew who gets rid of it. And Julian Alvarez having a pretty intense conversation on the sidelines with Pep Guardiola. Won't be long, I don't think before we see him, but City trailing palace by two goals to Nill. The commentary to come at 5.30pm from Arsenal against Fulham. Arsenal, the leaders this morning, the only side with a 100% winning record. John Murray and Charlie Adam bringing commentary from the Emirates. What about that latest chance, Pep? It's six now just now, scored one in the second half, they should have scored three. And I was just thinking tonight, you get ten minutes of highlights, they'll be able to fit in all the goals, but there's no chance that all the clear cut chances that Liverpool need will be shown tonight. Well, for me, who earlier had scored his first goal at Anfield in the Premier League since Tottenham December 2020, his last 11 goals in the Premier League had all been away from home and he was close to getting a second there as Liverpool already leading by six goals to Nill. As for Everton, they're at Brentford, lead late-man. I have no idea how Brentford haven't scored in this game, still Brentford and Liverpool have never scored in the Premier League, they've just hit the frame of the goal Brentford for a third time, acrobatic, overhead, nor guard, ten yards out and it came crashing off the crossbar. Is there ever going to be a Brentford goal this afternoon, still Brentford and Nill Everton won somehow? Gavin Buchlan, who is the Everton historian, had tweeted during the week, it was the first top flight season since 1911-12 that Everton and Liverpool had both failed to win their first league games. The first season Everton finished second, Liverpool actually failed to win their first five that particular season but it could be a mercy side double in the Premier League today as Carvalho, right-hand side attacking the Cop, gets it back from Alexander-Arnold and Liverpool are forced away from the penalty area. We'll knit back to Stamford Bridge as the ball goes out of play for a goal kick. Masbarouki, Chelsea left that. Still Chelsea won, Leicester Nill, but there's a great chance for a second for Sterling. Everton set Chelsea away on the counter, Sterling shot bounced off the post. Still ten men, Chelsea won, Leicester Nill. Pitchard game in league once at Derby, there's been a red card, Chris Coles. To Peterborough, Peterborough down two, ten men, still Nill Nill, but Nathan Thompson walking off. He's been waved off by the Derby fans, two yellow cards, one in the first off were assured for the second one bringing down Conor Huron on the edge of the penalty area. Nill Nill, but Peterborough down to ten men. Another goal there, Pitchard game in league two, Charlotte Richardson. Yeah, Leighton Orien started the second half, exactly how they began the game as well by scoring courtesy of Paul Smith. His first effort on target was smothered by goalkeeper Ben Kiddup. He made no mistake with the second slot in the ball home into the back of an empty net. Leighton Orien free, hardly poor one. No other goals to tell you about elsewhere. Bournemouth have got a free kick on this near side, plenty for the thoughts of Scott Parker, 50th league game in charge. The last manager actually to win here in the Premier League, March 2021, when Fulham with the Lameen at the only goal, won by a goal to Nill. Fulham, since then, Liverpool have won 18 and drawn six as the Rumbiten in 24 that will certainly go to an undefeated run of 25 as they're handsomely in control here. Tavernier with an arcing free kick in and the chance of a consolation for Jefferson Lerner heads it wide, goal kick Pat Nevin. Yeah, there's a half chance there, you should get it on target. It's possibly not less, it's not going to the man they wanted to go to with Dummets Lanky on the pitch now. They would have hoped he would have been in the back post and he could have made it to the end of it. But that's one little half a chance, but you do suspect that they're not going to get too many chances Bournemouth. They are not committing players forward unless they have a set piece at this point in time in Liverpool. Just having a little rest for a moment. 6-0-6 tonight after our next commentary with Chris Sutton and Robbie Savage. I'm sure Chris Sutton would like to hear from Sunderland fans in particular about Alex Neal's decision to leave the stadium of light 0-8-0-8-5-9-0-9-6-9-3 as there's been another goal at Watford in a championship. Aaron Paul, Watford 2-QPR 2 this time. It's a goal for Zia Pedro, who's wrestled the ball off a QPR defender. They've taken advantage of some really slack ranges defending and has lashed the ball into the far corner. Watford 2-QPR 2. 6-0 to Liverpool. Manchester City still trail 2-0 at home to Crystal Palace. There's Liverpool from left to right. Have it now with Jordan Henderson. Carvalho back to Fabinho. Perfect opportunity to give Carvalho a sustained run out for this second half, facing the excellent Harvey Elliott, such as the nature of the scoreline for Jurgen Klopp. The games will continue to come thick and fast over the next few weeks with the Champions League set to resume. Now there's been a goal at the Etihad. Will Perry. It's now Manchester City 1, Crystal Palace 2. Bernardo Silva allowed to cut inside onto his left foot, took a little nick off a Crystal Palace defender and bobbled past Vicente Geiter in the Crystal Palace net. And now for President Gundawan coming on for City 1. Palace 2. Thank you, Will. We'll keep you up to date. Just looking at Solanke's come on to the field of play whilst we've been away, the former Liverpool player. 30 goals he scored last season, his best season yet for the England International. And the player who's come on for is Ryan Christie. So another change being made for Scott Martin. You can see the reasoning for that, Dennell, because you want physicality when the balls have been played into the box. So you've got Billing with his physique, you've got Solanke with his physique. They can break forward now and again, but really defensively, when this cross is coming in, you want those big lads in there to make sure that there are no more easy headers. There have been far too many of them so far. Wigan are going to be losing their unbeaten run, it would seem. They've now conceded a third goal. Wigan won Burnley 3 and you would think that Burnley are on course for their first win in 5 in the championship. Talking of East Lancashire, Blackburn, Pat Murphy. Stokes still lead 1-0 and they deserve to do so, but through Baker in the first half, but they've got to head the seam up now, Rovers. They've made a couple of substitutions at halftime. The crowd are on their side now. Tricky periodists for Stokes, who lead Blackburn 1-0. So Blackburn in midweek, they made 10 changes in the league. Certainly John Dalthomason has some promising youngsters coming up through the ranks. Tyler Morton, who's on loan from Liverpool, actually played as a centre-back in that game. As Liverpool win the ball towards Salah, just couldn't take it and he's striped. Well done, Mo Salah. Very well done. He could have made a meal of that and it would have been a possible sending off there. And he just tumbled over. I think he was probably touched as well. Got on his feet and I think he saved a fellow pro there. Was it Lerma who had made the challenge? Carlisle won Jillingham Mill. Carlisle without a win in four in league two, leading at Brunton Park. Paul Simpson's team. BBC Radio 5 Live, Liverpool leading by six goals to 0. Tomorrow, 5 Live Premier League Sunday from midday. Aston Villa West Hammett 2, followed by Nottingham Forest Tottenham at 4.30. The Monday night club with Mark Chapman at 7. Tuesday we're at Ellen Road, Leeds Everton. Wednesday Liverpool Newcastle. Thursday Leicester City Manchester United. Thursday night on transfer deadline day. Cambridge 2, Burton 2, Blackpool 2, Bristol City 1. Huddersfield 2, West Bromwich Albion 2. Steve Bruce's side with 2-0 down. They've now got it back to 2-2 in West Yorkshire. There's Bournemouth in front of that travelling support from the south coast. That would have been a good six hours journey I would have thought from Bournemouth. Bournemouth have a corner kick on this near side. And the ball's dead then on, which is nice of them and the six now don't. They have stayed. Very, very loyal. Corner kick to Bournemouth and it goes to the near post. Headed out by Henderson. Another wicked hit the cricket, Ellie. Ben Stokes has taken two since T in consecutive overs from him and Keegan Peterson is out. A really good partnership, really good batting performance by Peterson and Van de Doosen. But Stokes has got them both, 151 for five South Africa now. They're still 113 behind. Commentary continues on sports extra here at Anfield in the sunshine. Cook loses the ball, Fabinho plays it forward. Just a little bit of Henderson tries to nick it away from Zamora. The left back who now can come forward over the halfway line. A rare foray pat for Bournemouth into Liverpool territory. There's a little bit more danger about them going forward up this left hand side. The two substitutes, Billing and Szilanky. They've actually worked together. What would Dominic Szilanky do to get a goal here at Anfield? He would love that. Yeah, he didn't have... I think it was one goal in 27 appearances when they signed in Liverpool. Of course, it probably had been a product of Chelsea's youth. It's a loan spell at Vitesse Arnhem. Sheffield Wednesday five, Forrest Green-Neal is the latest scorer in League One and Aberdeen have got another goal against the 10 men of Livingston in the Scottish Premiership. Aberdeen two, Livingston-Neal. I love a lot about humour in football. The Bournemouth fans are so timid. They pass the ball just now. That's 6-0 down. And now they've got themselves a throw in front of the Sakenidowgli stand on that far side, the right. There's been another goal at Ibrox, ready to side. And it's another goal from Rangers and another goal from Antonio Cholaic. Excellent work by Tillman and Kent. They set him up all in mark, 18 yards. In just three, Ross County-Neal and it's almost on the arrow. Thank you, Roddy. 6-0 here to Liverpool. Alexander-Arnold sprays the ball forward. Salah, good scoring record. He's got against Bournemouth, wants to get in on the act. He enters the penalty area right-hand side now, attacking the cop end. But Lerner back there helping out, slides to his knees. Ushes the ball behind for a corner kick. Corner kick to Liverpool, still hungry for more goals. Yeah, desperate to turn it off. Of course, you know more Salah, you know, each season he wants to be a top goal-scorer. So he will not give up here at all. And I suspect if he's hooked to some point to rest him, he probably won't be happy because there are more goals out there if he wants them. Corner kick pulled back. Robertson with a curling effort. Travis with the save, double save. Still around, Firmino from close range, makes it 7. It could well be a record-equalling win in the Premier League for Liverpool. And Roberto Firmino, backs the brace. As Liverpool have got a seventh goal against the hapless Bournemouth. Did I mention there's more goals here? About two seconds before. Look, that's not being clever. Every time they've attacked, every time they've put a cross in, they've looked all over the place. And then Goalkeeper, you know, Travis there, he didn't really look that comfortable. Didn't worry when the ball was played in there. Really not comfortable. OK, there's a player in front of him, but you don't handle the ball straight out in front of you. It's no good goalkeeping there in the end. It's a tap in for Firmino. It won't get many easy goals in that. Well, stand by for the record books to be potentially ripped up today. Three times, the side has scored, and beaten the opposition 9-0 in the Premier League. And for Bournemouth, that all-time record defeat is actually 9-0. And in fact, that was Harry Redknapp. It was his first game in management. He was the caretaker manager replacing Dave Webb back in 1982. And Bournemouth on that day lost 9-0 to Lincoln City. When you 7-0 down with still just under half an hour ago, you'd fear the worst. Especially, as they say, at the corp end, and if Liverpool want to go and push it forward. And as I said, I don't think they're firing all cylinders right now, Liverpool. I think there are, I said, gears. There's gears, plural. If you go through from here, just now, and probably the Bournemouth have got, there's just a lot of players out there that want to fill their boots because they want to get in the scoring list. So they're not turning, they're not taking it easy yet. One man in particular, Mo Salah, eight goals in his previous six games against Bournemouth. He wants to get in on the ax. Keltan won, Oxford United, and there's a latey score in League One. Hull 3, Coventry 1 will go to Naz after we've been to Maz. Second goal for Chelsea, a second goal for Raheem Sterling. A simple tap in for him at the left-hand post. There's some lovely work down the right-hand side from Rhys James in the build-up. Ten-man Chelsea 2, Leicester Nill. Here he is, here's Naz. Hull City 3, Coventry 1, the new hero of East Yorkshire. Oscar Estapina with a hat-trick. He couldn't miss from a couple of yards out. Hull 3, Coventry 1. Liverpool are going to be making a change, and we're going to see a youngster coming on here by the name of Stefan Bachetic, who is a 17-year-old. He can either play in the central defence or midfield, and his father, Sir Dan, used to play for Celto Vigo and Red Star. He was out on the Asia tour, started against Salzburg, and so he's going to be coming on. They signed him from Celto Vigo in February 2021. It's going to be a Liverpool debut for Bachetic. We're going to see James Milner coming on as well as we go back to Manchester City and Will Perry. Here's Foden just inside the box, touch with the left foot. Cross to Harland! And there is the equaliser for 2-0 down. Manchester City a level, four goals in four-goal. Game through Erling Harland, and they finally made those substitutions as well. They're going to see the Alvarez and Gunduan replacing Cancelo and Márez and City all level, but they'll be looking for three points. City 2, Palace 2. Yeah, they will. 25 minutes remain. Liverpool yet to make a change. The points are secure, whilst Manchester City are going for three points. Liverpool have already backed those three points. They're just going for goals here at Anfield. Five-lives, still to come. Commentary of Arsenal, full-on at 5.30 after sports report. Liverpool playing from left to right in all red. Corner kick right-hand side. Alexander-Arnold to take it. There are five redshirts to aim for in the penalty area. Seller waits just outside the box. It goes towards Van Dijk, and he's headed behind for another corner pack. Yeah, Van Dijk gets up the back post there. He did have three players there, and they still get a clean head of there. I mean, those players are coming down now. They must be thinking the same thing. A chance to score goals in front of the Cop End. They will get opportunities. Alexander-Arnold with the corner. Van Dijk climbs. Travers catches the ball inside his six-yard area. BBC Radio 5 live in the World Service. Manchester City have come from 2-0 down to 2-2. Chelsea lead Leicester City by two goals to 0. Brighton leads 0, Brentford 0, Everton 1, and a goal now at Derby in League 1. Chris Coles. And how about this? Ten-man Peterborough have the lead. Derby 0, Peterborough 1, Josh Knight the second half sub at the back post. Jack Marriott found in with a stooping header, and Knight tapped in. Peterborough down to 10-men, but they lead Derby at Pride Park by a goal to nil. Derby County who previously won all three at home this season. Cheltenham 1, Oxford United 1 is the latest score in League 1. Bristol City have equalised at Blackpool. Blackpool 2, Bristol City 2 is the latest score, and Aberdeen have got a fourth against the 10-men of Livingston in the Scottish Premiership. You're up to date with the goals as they go in here on BBC Radio 5 Live. Not quite. Another goal at Stanford Bridge, Masferuki. Leicester pulled one back. Some lovely work from Harvey Barnes. A really great finish at a tight angle on the left-hand side of a good one too with Jamie Bardi. Chelsea 2, Leicester 1. Going to be a triple change being made by Jürgen Klopp here at Anfield. MK Donnes have got a fourth. Morkham nil, MK Donnes 4, and Rochdale have equalised. Rochdale 1, Crawley 1 is the latest score in League 2. There's now been a goal, deadlock broken at the Ammix to Hellside. Finally, the Brighton fans will say it's about time after 66 minutes. Brighton lead leads by a goal to nil. Well work from left to right, and it fell to gross inside the area, and he didn't dare miss. Brighton 1 leads nil. Both of those two sides unbeaten going into today's game. Brighton enjoying an excellent start to the campaign. That would actually take them top, albeit only for a couple of hours. But they would go a point ahead of Arsenal, who of course, the only side with a 100% winning record so far, and they take on Fulham at home in the 530 game live on BBC Radio 5 Live. Pat Nevin. Yep, love they'll try to make that triple change. They've been trying to do it for about five minutes now. I think they'll finally have a chance to do that, and a little bit of blessed relief if you're a Bournemouth player, a Bournemouth fan, or indeed the Bournemouth manager. Maybe a couple of youngsters coming on, but one anyway, Simacast is coming on for James Milner. I don't think they can call him a youngster, can they? So Simacast will come on for Andrew Robertson. That will be like for Leic at left back. Roberto Firmino, who's got a couple of goals, unable to grab himself a third Liverpool hat-trick today. He will make way, and then the other player to come off is going to be Jordan Henderson, I think. Jordan Henderson. He's going to make way on his 400th Premier League appearance of his career. I don't think he's actually seen the board yet, as Jordan... ..and that would be Stefan Bachetic, who's going to be coming on. A good chance to see Bachetic play, and if you're coming off a team, the joy of coming on in a home game when you're seven-hour, with absolutely no pressure whatsoever. It's perfect. So Jordan Henderson on his 400th Premier League appearance of his career makes way. And on comes the teenager, Stefan Bachetic, to make his debut here for Liverpool. It's a great welcome from those Liverpool fans, and I'm a little desperate to see how they're playing. I'm just noticing the number of players that have come on. Now, Cavaliers come on. He's done some really neat, nice little play, and he's fitted in well. It's one of the things about Liverpool, when they bring a player in, it's amazing how often they just slot in easily. Let's get an update from the cricket with Ellie. And South Africa 157 for five. There's still 107 behind in those two crucial wickets since T. Both caught behind by Ben, folks, off the bowling of Ben Stokes, starring with the bat yesterday, starring with the ball and the gloves today, and an unplayable delivery, particularly to get rid of Keegan Peterson. If you want to watch them again, they're on the BBC Sport website, the live text pages, but England having another sniff at getting victory by the end of today or certainly early tomorrow morning. South Africa still 107 behind, 157 for five. Thank you, Ellie. Commentary on sports extra, no other goals elsewhere. Liverpool here leading 7-0, ball seen out behind for a goal kick. Just thinking about it, said by Cetic, because he was signed from Selta Vigo, but if you think Serdan with his Serbian heritage, it's probably Steppen by Cetic, isn't it? Why are you asking me? That's a fairly good chance. Essentially, when players come in, they almost angle-side some of the games sometimes, but we shall find out soon enough. It's interesting to see where he fits into the side there. Who plays up front? He's going up front in the centre-fold position. Salah stayed on the right-hand side, and let's get a little chance for Cavalio to play in the left. 19 minutes remain here at Anfield in the sunshine. Liverpool still leads 7-0, Brentford, Neil Everton won, Brighton won, leads 0, Chelsea down to 10 men, lead Leicester by two goals to 1. And just as last weekend, Manchester City fighting back and hauling back a two-goal deficit. Will Perry? 68 minutes gone. Erling Haaland now on the ball after KDB played him through and De Bruyne with a free kick, which came to nothing just before that, but it's Manchester City who seem to have gone up a couple of gears since that equaliser, and that equaliser, by the way, Erling Haaland's 134th goal in 135 games for clubs and country. City 2, Palace 2. Erling Haaland, who in the Champions League draw on Thursday, will have a reunion with his former club, Borussia Dortmund. So many stories that came out from that Champions League. It will be comprehensively covered on BBC Radio 5 Live. Brentford-Everton, Lee Blakeman. Brentford, Neil Everton won, couple of great chances for Brentford to equalise. Vitaliy Yemels just nearly scored ahead with his first touch, brilliant save by Pickford, low down to his left. That just moments after Umbermo put a curler wide at the top corner from the edge of the area, 18 to play. Brentford, Neil Everton won. Northampton and Doncaster both unbeaten in League 2, but it's Doncaster who've just taken the lead. Northampton, Neil, Doncaster won, and Burton down to 10. Men are back in front. Cambridge United 2, Burton 3 in League 1. Five live in the World Service here, and Liverpool playing from left to right. Now with the Carvalho in from that left touch line to Louis D'Az, stopped by Billing. When you're a manager and you've suffered a heavy defeat like this, what do you take out of it? You take out of it as another game very soon. You try and say to them, same thing. Constantly you will say, there's only three points, get on the next one. If you win the next game, it's forgotten. It was 2-0 to Crystal Palace, then it was 2-2. There's now been a fifth goal, Will Perry. It's been coming, it's Manchester City 3, Crystal Palace 2, and Erling Haaland has his second of the afternoon. It's the simplest goal that he'll score. It's a tap-in after great work from Bernardo Silva, and there was Haaland, just a tap-in past Vicente Geiter. We've still got 20 minutes to go. It's City 3, Palace 2. Blackpool 2, Bristol City 3 is the latest score in the championship. Pat says Bournemouth will have another game. That is right. They come very, very quickly. Wolves at home on Wednesday. A chance to dust themselves down for a beleaguered Bournemouth, as Trent Alexander-Arnold on the attack right-hand side delivers the cross. That was blocked by Sinesi at the back there for Bournemouth. Another goal at Millwall in the championship. Paul Scott. Well, it's been disallowed. It's Millwall-0, Reading 1. Still a triple change from Gary Rower to try and inject some urgency into this match. To try and ignite it, the home side have offered very, very little. They've just had a goal disallowed. They're backing it. Millwall-0, Reading 1. Mo Salah here inside the six-yard area. Left-footed has somehow blazed the ball over the bar. He seems destined not to score against the team. He loves scoring against. He's actually at the top of his right foot. They miss from two yards in the first half. Then he's through one and one with a goalkeeper on his left foot, and he's lashed it over the bar. Look at this. That's not Mo Salah's brother down there. Arsenal Fulham to follow sports report with commentary from the Emirates, Charlie Adam, and John Murray, who has the team news? Yes, and with it, news of a setback for Arsenal, because the early leaders have lost both Pate and Zincenko to injuries yesterday afternoon. So, Arteza makes his first two team changes of the season. El Neni and TNE come in for them. Unbeaten Fulham make one change to their last league team. Cabanos back from injury, replacing the teenager Stansfield. Thank you, John. Ipswich 2, Barnsley 1. The league one leaders are back in front. Kilmarnock have equalised at Rugby Park and the Scottish Premiership. Kilmarnock 1, Motherwell 1, Hull City 3. Coventry 2 is now the latest in the championship. And there's been a sending off. Oxford have had Billy Bowden sent off. They're drawing 1-1 away at Cheltenham. Aaron Pauls had another goal of Vicarage Road. Watford 2, QPR 3. Again, QPR Sting on the counterattack. Ball in from the left. It was missed by Chair. There was a slip from a defender and there was the man they called Uncle Alba. Alba Adoma to lash past the goalkeeper in off the post. Watford 2, QPR 3. Hartliff Poole got a goal back. Lake Norrion 3, Hartliff Poole 2. Rotherham 2, Birmingham City 0 is the latest in the championship. Alexander Arnold waiting to take a throw in front of the Cop. Liverpool leading 7-0 against Bournemouth and Liverpool go all the way back to Allyson. I told you about that goal at Hull City. Details from Naz. Hull City 3, Coventry 2. Matt Godden corner flicked in and tapped in by Godden to give them a little bit of hope. Hull City 3, Coventry City 2. Alexander Arnold outside of the right boot finds Salah. Rolls away from his man in the penalty area, meppen behind, knocks it behind for a corner kick, 7-0 Liverpool. Yeah, absolutely willing Salah to get a goal with the Cop there. Timing again, he's making the runs. He's desperate. I think if he's slightly mildly embarrassed if he wins 7-8 now and he doesn't get on the score sheet, it'd be absolutely stunning if that happened. In fact, it didn't take a deflection at all. It's gone out for a goal kick. Bournemouth are going to make a change. Ben Pearson is going to be coming on and it's going to be Lewis Cook who's coming off. While the change happens, latest score on the Scottish Premiership. Aberdeen 4, Livingston 0, living down to 10 men. Kilmarnock 1, Motherwell 1, Rangers 3, Ross County 0, St Mirren 1, Hibbs 0. The latest scores in Scotland. Bristol Roes have just taken the leading league one at home to Shrewsbury. 1-0, like for like in many ways. Pearson coming on for Lewis Cook in the Bournemouth midfield. Back to Stamford Bridge, Maz Faroukis. Still Chelsea 2, Leicester 1. Indeedy has gone close with a shot from the D though. And then one just wider the right hand post. Leicester fight for the equaliser. Inevitably they're seeing the ball as well. A lot more with the man in advantage but they still trail 2-1. Ladies' scores in league 2. Wimbledon 0, Barrow 1. Bradford and Crew is 0-0 at Valley Parade. Carlisle 1, Jilling a 0. Harrogate 0, Newport County 4. Leighton Orient 3, Hartley Paul 2. Leighton Orient, of course the leaders. Hartley Paul, still get to win under their new manager, Paul Hartley. Norbhampton 0, Don Castor-Rober 1. Rochdale 1, Crawley 1. Rochdale bottom of the table and yet to win. Salford 0, Stevenage 0, Stotport 0, Swindon 1. Sutton 1, Mansfield Town 0. Tramilid, Colchester by a goal to 0. And it's Walsall 1, Grimsby Town 0. And here we've got a player who's down. Yeah, I don't even think there's a foul. He tried to actually go a ton and volley the ball away. But he's caught the studs of the Liverpool defenders there. And that's a lot of team there. And he's hopefully on his shin track when it happened. Well, there's a stoppage in play, Liverpool leading 7-0. Let's get news of that Hartley Paul penalty from Charlotte. Hello, you join me now as Leighton Orient have just regained their lead moments ago. Josh Amira brought Hartley Paul back into this game. But Orient, they're at the top of the division for a reason. And Rulster Tori, the substitute for the house, has just put them ahead. Goals, goals, goals going on here. It's Leighton Orient 4, Hartley Paul 2. Leighton Orient 4, Hartley Paul United 2. I'll give you the latest scores in League 1, acting to 0. Exeter 0, Bristol Roversley, Trusbury 1-0, Cambridge 3, Burton 3. Burton, remember, were down to 10 men in the 10th minute when Johnny Smith was sent off. Cheltenham 1, Oxford 1, Billy Bowden dismissed for Oxford, seeing out the last 16 minutes with 10 men. Derby 0, Peterborough who also had Nathan Thompson sent off. But it's Peterborough who lead 1-0 there at Derby. The leaders hit switch, lead Barnsley 2-1, Lincoln 2, Fleetwood 1, Morkham 0, MK Donnes 4, Morkham still without a win. Plymouth lead Bolton by a goal to 0. Paul Vale 0, Portsmouth 1, Sheffield Wednesday 5, Forrest Green 0, Wickham 1, Charlton 1. Let's get an update from Brentford, still get to resume here. Lee Blateman. Brentford have just had a penalty appeal waved away. They trail Everton 1-0, Alex Awobi arm out, it went to VAR. No penalty was the shot, we've got 11 to play. Brentford 0, Everton 1. Brighton leads, Sir Hal Sahi. Brighton leads by a goal to 0, 12 minutes to play here. And apart from the goal, the biggest cheer of the afternoon has gone for Jesse Marsh, the leads manager. He picked up a book in here. Brighton leads by a goal to 0. We'll have commentary from Ellen Rowland. Tuesday night, lead united against Everton. A busy night of midweek action in the Premier League. Liverpool looking for an eighth goal. Here is Carvalho. And Carvalho on the volley right footed. Cracks the ball past Travis. It's a record Premier League win for Liverpool. And it's a first goal for the former player. Fabio Carvalho in front of the cop end. Liverpool 8, Bournemouth 0. You sometimes take the brilliant so granted, and you come into foul play from the right back position. It's a 60-70 yard ball. Brighton is semi-gassed, is left footed there. He plays it first time back. And it's a volley by Carvalho. Since Carvalho's come on, it has to be said, every touch he's had, the Liverpool fans have been touring. They have loved the way he's held the ball. He's very young. I think he's only 19 years of age. But he fits in here perfect. He's only been on for half of the game. He scored his goal. He's a player for the future. Who's going to do incredibly well for Liverpool? This is also pure torture for anyone from Bournemouth. This is horrible to watch. And as we've said all along, everything Liverpool attack. Because if you go to score. You'd appreciate the technique. They're already imagining Pat that right footed volley. The technique in the volley was brilliant from Carvalho. But it's every touch he's had since he comes on. There's no passes all over the place. When he gets the ball, he's got utter comfort. Everything that's around him. He's going to walk in. If you put him in any position in this Liverpool front line, and maybe even midfield as well, he will look at home. He is that good. To compound Bournemouth's misery, the substitute Ben Pearson appears to have picked up a knock. So he is now hobbling off down the tunnel. So the substitute has been substituted. And it's Moncandes who's come on to replace him. In this second half with eight minutes remaining. And there's going to be another change being made. Chris Meppen is going to be coming off. And it's going to be Owen Bevan, who is going to be coming on. A 19-year-old defender to make his debut for Bournemouth in the closing stages here at Anfield with his side 8-0 down. Manchester City were 2-0 down. They've turned it around. Will Perry. 12 of the 19 to play in Manchester City 3. Crystal Palace 2, they've got a corner. And Harlan came close to a hat-trick a couple of minutes ago. A glancing head away from a forward and cross. Alisa and Mateta on for IU and Climb for Palace City 3. Palace 2. And here we're going to have another debutante. If you remember the former Newcastle United midfielder, Lee Clarke. Well, his son Bobby is coming on to make his Liverpool debut. He's been on the bench the last two games. Bobby Clarke, a 17-year-old midfielder. Joined from Newcastle in 2021. Many occasions I've been sat here and Lee's just been sat up, probably with Bobby away towards that. A right-hand side over our right shoulders. Well, what a proud moment this is for the Clarke family. So Bobby Clarke coming on to make his debut here with seven minutes of normal time remaining. And another goal at Ibrox for Roddy. Anything Liverpool can do twice, Rangers can do once. Stephen Davis with a side-foot from a driven cross. 12-yard zone mix at Rangers for Ross County, Nell Tentagall. We have got seven minutes remaining of normal time. Still got to give you the latest scores in the championship. But Liverpool's previous best in the Premier League in terms of a record win was against Crystal Palace December 2020. That has been eclipsed. Don't think they'll actually get their record league win, which was against Rotherham Town in 1899 when they won 10-1. But you never know if they could just bag a couple here in the closing stages. It's still amazing to think that they've scored eight goals and sell it. Hasn't scored, no. That isn't on the score sheet. And by the way, should have had two, maybe three goals himself. And other players have had great chances as well. And it is eight going on 10, 11, 12. And as the people I'm saying, I'm not sure they're playing at 100%. There will be more chances. There's seven minutes. There's been a hole in the substitutions. You wouldn't be surprised at nine. In front of the Cop corner kick, six minutes remain. Simac has to take it. It's another goal. Luzdi has no post-header. And Bournemouth have conceded nine. And it is a record-equalling margin of victory in the Premier League. Liverpool become the fourth side to register nine goals. That one at the Cop. We won 10. Is the chance inside Anfield? Yeah, no surprise at nine. Sly surprise in your voice, but none in my mode, so ever. You know, they've not defended. Corners have not defended anything from open play there. And here, just walks into that near post-header. Now, to be fair, it's a good corner to enter near post-header. But no one challenged him. Nine now, and the house is still here. Meanwhile, there's been another goal. Manchester City will parry. And from two-nil down, Manchester City now lead crystal palace by four goals to two. And Erling Haaland has scored his first hat-trick for Manchester City. Beautiful ball from Gunduan. Haaland out-muscle, Joel Ward. Into the bottom-left corner. What a turnaround. City four, palace two. Four-two there. Chelsea down to 10 men. Lead Leicester City to one. Brighton one lead. United-nil. What about Brentford? Everton, Lee Blakeman. Equaliser for Brentford at last. From the corner, Yenel got a tap in. From about three yards out. If ever an equaliser was deserved, it's that for Brentford. Push, push, push. And now they have their goal. Five to play. Brentford won. Everton won. These are the latest scores in the championship. Well, the result was Sunderland-nil Norwich. One, they temporarily went second. Latest scores, Blackburn-nil, Stoke City one. Dean Holden in caretaker charge. Blackpool two, Bristol City three. Cardiff Preston is nil-nil. Huddersfield two, West Bromwich Albion two. Hull City three, Coventry two. Middlesbrough looking for their first win of the season. Leeds Swansea by two goals to one. Millwall-nil, Reading one. Rotherham two, Birmingham-nil, Watford two. Queen's Park Rangers three. Wigan going to lose their unbeaten record. Wigan one, Burnley three. They are the latest scores. There's been another goal at Derby. Chris Cole. Equaliser for Derby. They've finally taken one of their chances. Jason Knight, front post header from a corner. With two minutes to play, Derby will fancy their chances now. Against ten-man Peterborough. Derby one, Peterborough one. Salah trying to force his way in the penalty area, still going. And then it's just cleared away by Lerner. Any red will do. This is the most easiest Anfields been for quite some time. Purely because the Liverpool fans, they're a greedy bunch. They want ten goals. No, they want ten. It's so unusual to get at this level of football. But it's a game within a game. And everyone understands the significance of it. To go into double-fingers would be incredible. So Liverpool might have been tempted just to see this game out. However, the fans, as you can hear, are not having it. They want ten. Southampton fans are often get quite irked when you mention the defeats that they've suffered at the hands of either Manchester United or Leicester City by conceding nine goals. It will not be popular at all on the south coast now. Nine-nil with Bournemouths are coming. The other, of course, was the Manchester United beating Ipswich. Nine-nil in the 90s. Never as a team in the Premier League hit double-fingers. But Liverpool certainly will try their utmost in the next three minutes. The most important test in the field may well be the referee then. Because we know a whole host of changes. There's been a couple of injuries in the second half as well. There should be a minimum of about five or six minutes. I do do it again. I wonder if you'll do it. I'm not sure he will add on too much. I think there may be about a sympathy vote from the referee. We'll give you the latest scores. Derby, we've heard about Sutton, two-man's-field-one. That's in league two. Cheltenham won Oxford United two. Oxford United down to ten men have turned that one around. Stopport have equalised at home to Swindon, one-one. And it's Walsall one. Grimsby, down two. They're the latest scores. Plymouth in fact two. Bolton-nil is now a latest score. Tramya two. Colchester-nil reports and reaction to come in sports report. And then of course Arsenal, Fulham commentary from 5.30 with John Murray after sports report. Match of the day tonight, BBC One 25 past 10. Well, not very often you see this happen, is it? No, it's not. In my interest now about the going to Nandia, it's oddly lifted. Bournemouth and Weebet to go and tackle through themselves. And they've actually lifted their game, although they do not. There's pride at stake here. So Bournemouth have lifted their game as well. They're flying in, it tackles, and not just sitting back and trying to see this game to the end. So that is the game within a game at the moment. And Evli Red here is staying and thinking, I want to see history. I want to see double figures. Here is Gomez just over the halfway line. Now towards Van Dijk. Certainly Bournemouth will not want a place in the history books to concede 10 goals. As now it's with Salah. Plays it forward. Milder in the penalty area. Milder goes for goal and travels it. He's near post, turns it behind. Corner kick. Another goal at Derby. Chris Coles. Two goals in two minutes for Derby. Could well have won this game for the home side. David McGaldrick on as a second half sub. Tapping in an excellent cutback. Peterborough, 10 men. They were so close, but it looks like they'll lose this now. Derby 2, Peterborough 1. Corner taken short. Carvalho for Liverpool. Paul chipped in by Clark towards the far post. Knockdown header. Carvalho, was he fouled? The referee's had a look at that. VAR, of course, will have a look at it. Liverpool were looking for a penalty. They thought that there was a foul there on Carvalho. Goes out of play. Pat Nevin. Yeah, I have to say, I didn't think it was a great deal in it, but that doesn't matter now because we've got VAR. And they will definitely look at it. Certainly the goalkeeper-travers is not having it. He does not want to face a penalty kick in front of the cup at this point in the game. With very, very little time to go. And I think the assistant referee and the referee have been very kind. Four minutes. Four minutes have added on time, which we're now into. That's please the Liverpool fans who want a 10th goal. Elsewhere in the Premier League, Manchester City completely turning it around. Oh, hold on. They may be checking for it. But they were getting excited. They thought the VAR was having a check. They did check it, but they've overruled it and nothing doing there. Brentford won, Everton won. Brighton won, Leeds-Nill. Chelsea still down to 10 men after that Conagallagas send-off, still leading Leicester by two goals to one. And now Manchester City, four. Crystal Palace two. They were two-nil down. Erling Haaland though with a hat-trick in the space of 19 minutes at the Etihad. First minute of the four, eating up. Another goal at the Cury Drow. Hold on now. I'm not sure if this has been ruled out. If it is, it's a huge shame. Watford two QPR three. Watford have just seen Edouken with the most outrageous volley. 30 yards out. Smashed it past the goalkeeper. I think it's going to be ruled out. Watford two QPR three. Thank you, Aaron. Liverpool leading nine-nil. Salah on this near side. Being challenged by Solanke. Taken over by Billing. A very kick though in favour of Liverpool. Taken quickly. Salah's forward ball. Lewis Diaz right corner of the area. Goes on the outside. Waits doesn't deliver the cross. Tracks it away from the penalty area. Plays it back. Bacetic. Now finds Salah. Back towards Lewis Diaz. Lewis Diaz keeps the ball in play on this right side in front of the cop. Two more minutes remain. Milner. Now Bacetic to run forward. Looking for Lewis Diaz. Carvalho is there. And in the end, Marcones plays it out. Bournemouth-Burnley doing some defensive work. You think you need to remember, you know, it's got so close sometimes in the Premier League at the end of the season. It could be the whole difference. So you don't stop. Here is Van Dijk. Van Dijk's forward ball. Carvalho is there into the arms of Travers. He holds on to this one. Burnley have got a fourth. Wigan won. Burnley four. Blackpool have equalised late on. Also in the championship. Blackpool three. Bristol city three. Carvalho and Travers just having a word with each other and to intercept the two warring players. Well, he's gone down once in the box already. Carvalho. And this time he's gone down again. I've not seen a replay. So I can't tell you if there was any. They've had a little look at it. I don't think they're going to give a penalty. There are some players who come into the game and have to understand that there's... We don't go down quite that easy in the English game. And, you know, sometimes you just have to learn who has looked at the English game. And apart from going down a little bit too easy, Carvalho has been absent since the day of today. It's a record-equalling defeat for Bournemouth, matching that one away to Lincoln back in 1982. Harry Redknapp's first match in his managerial career as a caretaker. After he'd replaced Dave Webb, Salford have left it late, but have taken the lead. Salford won. Steven Hitchneil in League Two. And Liverpool right back in their own half as we enter the last 30 seconds of the minimum of four to be added on here on BBC Radio 5 Live. And the ball almost presented to Lewis Diaz. As rather reluctantly, some Liverpool supporters are heading towards the exits. They wanted to see a piece of history as it is. It will just be the fourth occasion in the Premier League era that a side has won by nine goals to nil. It's one very, very small moral victory that Bournemouth have got if they manage to get to the end and get to double-fegers. They've slowed everything down now. And Lucifer, they'll just see it out. I mean, it has been incredible how easy it has been to beat that Bournemouth defence today. Have been very, very poor today. Very, very poor. Burnley have got a fifth. Wigan won. Burnley five. Formers' misery is complete. They've suffered a joint record defeat in their history as Liverpool have equaled a Premier League margin of victory by hammering Bournemouth by nine goals to nil. Pat Nevin. Nine goals and it could have been more. And it's not an exaggeration. 12, 13, 14, it could have been that. Even just Mo Salah took his personal chances. Liverpool were brilliant. They even had more gears to go through and wanted to have even flooded a few young players as well. Everything went perfectly for Liverpool. Bournemouth, they will hope they will never have a deal like this again. That's the biggest surprise of all. Salah's not even on the scoresheet. Dias, Elliott, Alexander-Arnold, Firmino, van Dijk all before half-time and Mepermoon goal just after the restart. Firmino, Carvalho and Lewis Dias. Liverpool nine. Bournemouth nil. Reactions come from Anfield. Reactions come from all the games before our next commentary, which is Arsenal against Fulham.",
