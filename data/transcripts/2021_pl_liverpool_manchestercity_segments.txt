[0.00 - 9.20] P:1939.86 E:0.050909 |  Manchester City if they can win at Anfield for the first time since 2003 they would be 10 points
[9.20 - 14.48] P:1787.37 E:0.055918 |  ahead of Liverpool. We're just about set for kickoff. Liverpool with Alison in goal, Alexander
[14.48 - 21.20] P:1805.16 E:0.057670 |  Arnold Fabinho, Henderson and Robertson, Jones, Thiago, Wijnaldum, Salah, Firmino and Manet,
[21.20 - 26.40] P:1840.76 E:0.059599 |  Manchester City with Edison, Cancelo, Stones, Diascens and Zincenco, the tightest defence in
[26.48 - 33.04] P:1748.85 E:0.051487 |  the Premier League this season. Rodry, Vanado Silva, Gundawan, Mares, Sterling and Foden.
[33.04 - 37.28] P:1849.88 E:0.060598 |  The referee is Michael Oliva. It's the first time Michael Oliva has refereed Liverpool
[37.28 - 44.72] P:1818.35 E:0.056112 |  since the Merseyside Derby in the autumn when Virgil van Dijk was injured when he was clattered
[44.72 - 50.32] P:1835.32 E:0.056008 |  by Jordan Pickford. Michael Oliva puts his whistle to his lips and the players take the knee
[50.32 - 55.12] P:1789.18 E:0.058618 |  which has great significance at the moment with all of the bad things that have been going on on
[55.12 - 63.84] P:1709.88 E:0.057790 |  social media. So up they get and Manchester City get us underway here at Anfield, BBC Radio
[63.84 - 69.52] P:1668.26 E:0.069931 |  Five Live, the World Service are with us as well. There will be people listening and watching this
[69.52 - 77.60] P:1434.27 E:0.062386 |  match all around the globe. It is Liverpool against Manchester City and the ball is back with Edison
[77.60 - 82.56] P:1423.13 E:0.070444 |  who clears the ball out towards the left hand side, City with the ball deep inside their own half.
[82.64 - 87.68] P:1581.07 E:0.067023 |  The first big thing, Phil Foden is playing as that number nine. Sterling on the left hand side,
[87.68 - 92.32] P:1504.99 E:0.068240 |  Mares on the right, we all thought that Foden was on the left hand side, Sterling in the centre
[92.32 - 97.84] P:1516.77 E:0.062771 |  forward, but Foden is occupying that centre forward position but will drop deep to a number
[97.84 - 102.64] P:1483.50 E:0.065713 |  ten space and that will mean that Mares and Sterling's pace will run behind. So that's how
[102.64 - 108.32] P:1576.53 E:0.066124 |  City have started it, that's how Pep Guardiola has begun but of course that's subject to change.
[109.28 - 115.04] P:1431.94 E:0.067026 |  Bernardo Silva now Manchester City enjoying possession of the ball in the early stages
[115.04 - 120.00] P:1519.65 E:0.067511 |  and Rodri just turning it back into central defence. You look at Cantel's position now,
[120.00 - 125.84] P:1494.60 E:0.070462 |  stones and Diaz just isolated with Rodri, Cantel is playing as a central right-sided
[125.84 - 131.68] P:1593.68 E:0.072621 |  midfield player when City have the ball so it's very similar to... Oh, Edison has passed the ball
[131.68 - 136.96] P:1678.18 E:0.068813 |  straight to Sario Mane who's 30 yards out but City are quickly back into position and Liverpool
[136.96 - 142.24] P:1534.45 E:0.067146 |  couldn't take advantage, most of like Edison it was a brilliant pass straight to Mane.
[142.24 - 146.48] P:1481.42 E:0.061555 |  I'll tell you what, it's Mane's poor touch wasn't it John? It's almost, you know, come off his
[146.48 - 152.08] P:1451.81 E:0.060614 |  shim pad and went back towards his on-go if he took it forward with his pace would be a good
[152.08 - 156.96] P:1550.86 E:0.070446 |  opportunity for Liverpool. That's Robbie Savage with us on five live in the World Service,
[156.96 - 162.80] P:1553.51 E:0.069345 |  Welsh international Premier League midfielder and Liverpool conceding a free kick to Jagal
[162.80 - 168.80] P:1371.47 E:0.061592 |  has dived in there, centre field this is just next to the centre circle and
[171.12 - 178.40] P:1396.52 E:0.066613 |  is it Gundewan who is caught? The player has stayed down, I think it is Ilkai Gundewan
[178.40 - 183.52] P:1511.47 E:0.065642 |  who turned away from Sauer and then Tiago comes in and just catches the back of his heel.
[184.24 - 189.28] P:1477.54 E:0.068357 |  Yeah, you'll say that Tiago's nowhere near the ball. I think that should have been
[189.28 - 194.00] P:1596.81 E:0.070279 |  a yellow card John, doesn't matter what minute of the game is that should have been a yellow card.
[194.80 - 199.68] P:1609.50 E:0.071413 |  I think it is a yellow, yeah it is a yellow, he's got the card out now Michael Ollibach
[199.68 - 207.20] P:1643.01 E:0.064454 |  so a booking in the first, in the third minute of the match for Tiago for that foul on Ilkai
[207.20 - 213.12] P:1495.30 E:0.066943 |  Gundewan who's still down and as Robbie and Pat Nevin were saying before the match you know I think
[213.12 - 218.80] P:1447.99 E:0.067857 |  it's one of the great things about City at the moment and the reason that they're on this run of
[218.80 - 226.16] P:1541.28 E:0.069480 |  13 wins in a row is the fact that so many of their players are in good form, they're in prime form so
[226.16 - 232.56] P:1489.52 E:0.068826 |  there's no De Bruyne, no Kevin De Bruyne, no Sergio Aguero at the moment, the others have stepped up
[232.56 - 237.20] P:1391.36 E:0.070638 |  and Gundewan is one of them and if he's not able to continue that would be a big loss but here he
[237.20 - 244.00] P:1466.65 E:0.061589 |  is getting to his feet now, I think he's going to be okay. Yeah, you know for Pep and Manchester City
[244.00 - 251.12] P:1454.25 E:0.067331 |  he's been so influential, you know Kevin De Bruyne for me the best midfield player in the world,
[251.12 - 256.64] P:1629.75 E:0.066243 |  you know not in this Manchester City side Gundewan has stepped up, he's been you know fantastic and
[256.64 - 261.60] P:1388.82 E:0.067405 |  you know in Germany I'm led to believe that they think he's the best German player this million
[261.60 - 267.68] P:1558.11 E:0.069874 |  time. Nine goals this season from Ilkai Gundewan but it's his all-round play really as much as the
[267.68 - 273.44] P:1604.93 E:0.072986 |  goals. Liverpool nil, Manchester City nil and we do have a choice for you at the moment, the six
[273.44 - 280.72] P:1594.99 E:0.069346 |  nations match, the Wales Ireland match is on five live sports extra, Wales 11, Ireland 13 was the last
[280.72 - 288.40] P:1577.39 E:0.068848 |  score that I had, it's now Wales 18, Ireland 13 and you can listen to that five live sports extra
[288.40 - 294.24] P:1547.53 E:0.068736 |  on your digital radio or on BBC sounds or via BBC sounds. Here's Mane playing the ball into the
[294.24 - 300.16] P:1454.21 E:0.069483 |  penalty area, Firmino tries to angle it back to Thiago, Gundewan who's okay, Gundewan steps in
[300.16 - 305.12] P:1513.89 E:0.071363 |  and it's played up through the middle to Raheem Sterling, Gabriel Gézous only on the substitutes
[305.12 - 310.72] P:1515.29 E:0.066262 |  bench for this match, Jordan Henderson and Firmino in central defence for Liverpool and the ball
[310.72 - 316.64] P:1431.49 E:0.070868 |  has played out to Trent Alexander-Arnold who very much enjoyed listening to Steve Crossman's interview
[316.64 - 323.20] P:1453.02 E:0.065684 |  with him. In the build-up to this match that we were playing you earlier, it's on the football
[323.20 - 329.20] P:1432.28 E:0.068564 |  daily podcast today, it's well worth a listen, Firmino right for the ball downfield, Salah brings
[329.20 - 334.96] P:1367.45 E:0.066786 |  it down but Zincchenko is tight into him and plays it off, Liverpool's leading scorer for
[334.96 - 342.56] P:1488.92 E:0.066772 |  a three in Manchester City. What was the score on the rugby John? 18-13 to Wales just to make it
[342.56 - 349.12] P:1537.17 E:0.059551 |  absolutely clear. Do you know what John, you look at Salah and Márez, I think they're the two best
[349.12 - 353.84] P:1628.23 E:0.069036 |  players in the game, you know when it's that diagonal, that switcher play, the way they bring
[353.84 - 358.64] P:1636.59 E:0.071024 |  the ball down on the half folly instantly, those two are remarkable at doing it so it's going to be
[359.36 - 364.16] P:1546.42 E:0.071869 |  interesting to see how those two in the game this afternoon because two brilliant players.
[365.04 - 370.00] P:1470.41 E:0.069154 |  This Manchester City team who as they say have really hit their straps at the moment with this
[370.00 - 376.80] P:1470.45 E:0.070324 |  club record win, run of consecutive wins but also the fact that they've not conceded a goal in their
[376.80 - 385.92] P:1514.75 E:0.068372 |  last six Premier League matches, 21 clean sheets, 21 in all competitions this season, 21 clean sheets
[385.92 - 391.28] P:1375.59 E:0.065329 |  out of 33 matches and in one of them they conceded five goals against Leicester but that was before
[391.28 - 396.72] P:1446.52 E:0.065448 |  Dias came along who unquestionably has made a big difference. He has Alisson at the back,
[396.72 - 402.80] P:1544.66 E:0.071254 |  he's back from illness passing the ball to Jones and Bernardo Silva trying to close down Alisson
[402.80 - 407.44] P:1530.52 E:0.069800 |  who has to hurry his clearance which he does and as a result he hits it straight out of play on the
[407.44 - 412.72] P:1392.47 E:0.064570 |  far side, 10 yards inside the Liverpool half. Manchester City attacking towards the Cop in the
[412.72 - 419.76] P:1522.84 E:0.067505 |  first half setting up high here in the main stand with Robbie Savage socially distanced of course
[419.76 - 426.16] P:1508.55 E:0.067029 |  to my right, here's Márez on the right hand side and now Cancelot plays it in, it's a chest height
[426.16 - 431.04] P:1543.50 E:0.063543 |  oh and it bounced through Foden and then bounced off Gunduan and runs through for a goal kick.
[431.76 - 437.84] P:1408.83 E:0.063263 |  They're just two teams just looking you know the way they both have lined up, surprised me that
[437.84 - 443.20] P:1723.99 E:0.067389 |  Foden is the setter forward, both teams trying to play out, City pressing really high John.
[444.08 - 448.72] P:1504.22 E:0.066579 |  They are with Liverpool in possession in their own defence of third and Alexander-Arnold hits a
[448.72 - 453.60] P:1478.67 E:0.068180 |  long pass to Firmino down the right and then the challenge comes in and him just a knock it out
[453.60 - 459.20] P:1480.12 E:0.067050 |  of play for a throwing which is taken quickly Tiago now in his orange boots, pushing goes full
[459.20 - 464.64] P:1495.86 E:0.069501 |  360 degrees and then goes back into central defence, Henderson looks up, he's going for a long pass over
[464.64 - 469.28] P:1381.09 E:0.065951 |  the top for Mane but he's got City defenders either side of him both Cancelot and Stones
[469.28 - 474.32] P:1447.62 E:0.069154 |  and it bounces all the way through to Edison who's got the ball quite comfortably. It's a cold afternoon
[474.32 - 481.28] P:1637.47 E:0.066239 |  as you won't be surprised to hear there's been the occasional flurry of light snow but heavy grey
[481.28 - 488.08] P:1438.84 E:0.063726 |  clouds above Anfield, the lights are on, it's Nilnil and it's Manchester City the Premier League
[488.08 - 494.00] P:1415.91 E:0.065150 |  leaders who have the ball in the middle of their own half. John is fascinating so City there had
[494.00 - 498.96] P:1595.43 E:0.071511 |  a go kick they play out, they go to a 3-2-4-1 formation, the two players are Cancelot and Rodry
[499.60 - 505.36] P:1501.41 E:0.068543 |  and the centre half, the two is in Chenco's on the left hand side, Stones on the right with Diaz
[505.36 - 510.56] P:1546.30 E:0.070718 |  in the centre so it's amazing how they find a way to get out of the way they play, look at Cancel's
[510.56 - 516.24] P:1601.29 E:0.069109 |  position out, chance. Rodry finds Sterling on the left hand side, Sterling up against Alexander-Arnold
[516.24 - 520.48] P:1758.49 E:0.072893 |  lays it back, Zinchenko with a shot, it's cleared away by Henderson, he had to clear that, Forden
[520.48 - 526.00] P:1470.00 E:0.070084 |  was behind him if he hadn't, Forden would have been in on the edge of the six yard box
[526.00 - 531.20] P:1458.39 E:0.068437 |  that Henderson was able to get it away then Salah is crowded out by Sky Blue shirts and Manchester
[531.20 - 535.92] P:1413.89 E:0.061330 |  City are back in possession in the centre circle. It was a good block John as you said because
[535.92 - 543.28] P:1410.69 E:0.055520 |  Phil Forden would have had a tapping, good defending. And Manchester City have stuck with
[543.28 - 549.76] P:1468.59 E:0.066881 |  Forden through the middle, Márez is right out here on the right hand side and Sterling
[549.76 - 556.40] P:1462.90 E:0.070899 |  who was found by Rodry there for that last attack, Sterling in a very wide position on the left hand
[556.40 - 563.92] P:1464.16 E:0.067049 |  side, really interesting tussle, they drew 1-1 at the end, he had stadium in the autumn,
[564.56 - 569.20] P:1524.52 E:0.074186 |  terrific first half if you remember that match, Kevin De Bruyne missing the penalty as well
[569.20 - 573.68] P:1531.39 E:0.067922 |  and then it rather fizzled out in the second half after promising so much, Diaz's ball over the
[573.68 - 577.60] P:1460.37 E:0.066610 |  top but that's an easy one for Alisson holding Black to come to the edge of his area and catch.
[578.24 - 583.20] P:1700.24 E:0.071690 |  The reason why Sterling and Márez stay so wide John is because that allows the space
[583.20 - 589.36] P:1449.41 E:0.067945 |  for Gundewan and Bernardo Silva, so if you're one out then you're on Gundewan, Tiago going
[589.36 - 592.80] P:1550.61 E:0.071512 |  Bernardo Silva then who picks Cancelo is that for Meenals, Jop?
[594.24 - 598.40] P:1507.91 E:0.069234 |  And just looking at them now Robbie when City have got the ball at the back, I mean it's very
[598.40 - 603.60] P:1462.34 E:0.065524 |  clear isn't it, Sterling right over on the left, Márez right over here on the right hand side
[603.60 - 608.64] P:1443.73 E:0.071202 |  and clearly you know that's countering the danger of Liverpool's full backs as well isn't it?
[608.64 - 610.64] P:1559.47 E:0.072873 |  It's fascinating Liverpool then pressing high,
[612.88 - 616.16] P:1520.78 E:0.069275 |  it's fascinating technically to watch this game John.
[617.44 - 622.16] P:1457.12 E:0.072238 |  Throw in to Manchester City, level with the edge of their own penalty area, Liverpool 0,
[622.80 - 627.60] P:1384.95 E:0.063635 |  Manchester City 0, Forden takes the ball down, puts it back to Rodry who works it out with the
[627.60 - 631.44] P:1683.44 E:0.073572 |  far side but Alexander-Arnold's going to get there ahead of Sterling, Sterling puts the challenge
[631.60 - 636.64] P:1554.45 E:0.062429 |  in and then a heavy touch from Alexander-Arnold meant that Rodry was able to come across
[637.20 - 642.24] P:1338.49 E:0.070800 |  and take possession back from Manchester City, excellent work from Gundewan, now Bernardo Silva
[642.24 - 647.28] P:1611.73 E:0.068826 |  works himself out of a tight little situation there, he's another of the players who've run
[647.28 - 653.52] P:1544.33 E:0.064260 |  into form this season, Bernardo Silva gets the ball himself and then wins a three on the halfway line.
[655.52 - 660.40] P:1547.27 E:0.073393 |  So nil nil it is, Wales in front against Ireland, three o'clock kickoff in the six nations,
[661.20 - 666.80] P:1666.95 E:0.068108 |  earlier in the premiership, finished Newcastle 9, Exeter 15 in the rugby union premiership
[666.80 - 671.04] P:1647.19 E:0.066451 |  and if you've just switched on you haven't heard the earlier football results, Tottenham won two
[671.04 - 676.80] P:1595.67 E:0.067819 |  nil against West Brom, Harry Kane came back, scored, so did Son, so Tottenham two West Brom nil,
[676.80 - 682.00] P:1592.49 E:0.069889 |  finished Wolves nil, Leicester nil in our first commentary match and it finished Hamilton one,
[682.00 - 687.52] P:1469.01 E:0.065034 |  Rangers one, bottom of the table Hamilton scoring a very late equaliser against Rangers,
[687.52 - 691.68] P:1462.63 E:0.071903 |  six o' six later to talk about it all, we've got Comensure on Schafeel United, Chelsea as well on
[691.68 - 696.72] P:1494.40 E:0.066863 |  Five Live before Robbie and Chris on six o' six with the full name, Liverpool with the ball on the
[696.72 - 704.24] P:1319.57 E:0.062934 |  right hand side and here's Alexander Arnold, 30 yards out, Wijnaldum and Alexander Arnold plays
[704.24 - 709.36] P:1431.56 E:0.066231 |  it in towards Femina who's ball forward, took a deflection that bounced away, four Manchester City
[709.36 - 714.56] P:1347.91 E:0.067422 |  and then Canslow is able to clear it towards the halfway line, Henderson got there first
[714.56 - 719.76] P:1455.10 E:0.063153 |  on, now Robertson, Robertson with a cross from the left, Deass is underneath that and is able to
[719.76 - 726.56] P:1478.53 E:0.065863 |  volley it high across the penalty area, Femino nodded it back in, then Tiago's underneath it,
[726.56 - 731.52] P:1570.34 E:0.063493 |  then Alexander Arnold heads it forward, it's head tennis between the two sides and then eventually
[731.52 - 736.40] P:1616.47 E:0.063580 |  the ball is down with Sterling, it might have been took back there but Sterling does well, plays
[736.40 - 740.80] P:1511.01 E:0.069762 |  the ball up towards the edge of the box but referee Oliver has brought it back for Fowl on
[740.80 - 745.20] P:1565.07 E:0.075304 |  the halfway line, let's get another update from Gareth Lewis watching Wales Ireland in the six
[745.20 - 752.48] P:1596.26 E:0.069333 |  nations. So 21-13, Wales leads 67 when it's gone and that lead half-bunny penalty has taken Wales
[752.48 - 757.60] P:1721.59 E:0.073217 |  crucially more than a converted try clear, Wales looking to improve on last year when they only
[757.60 - 763.20] P:1641.72 E:0.067462 |  beat Georgia and Italy twice, they've not got long to go now to give Wijn Peeback there
[763.20 - 768.40] P:1695.80 E:0.070272 |  and a pressure head coach, a much needed win and victory to kick off this six nations campaign,
[768.40 - 774.56] P:1631.71 E:0.070503 |  21 points to 13 they lead Ireland. Thank you Gareth, so Gareth with a common treat with James
[774.56 - 782.08] P:1545.08 E:0.064914 |  Hook and Tommy Ball on sports extra, did you catch the score there Robbie? 21-13 it is to Wales,
[782.72 - 788.72] P:1449.95 E:0.064416 |  just in case you missed it, three to City, level with the edge of the Liverpool box,
[788.72 - 794.00] P:1469.91 E:0.059655 |  which has taken short for Sterling, who plays it back to Roderick, square from him, cancel
[794.00 - 797.60] P:1413.53 E:0.074418 |  in that position, Robbie's been talking about forward of the centre circle and Gunderwain,
[797.60 - 801.60] P:1397.13 E:0.063948 |  just a little touch there from Jones, took it away from Gunderwain and said you have to start
[801.60 - 807.04] P:1510.68 E:0.069886 |  again on the halfway line. Interesting start that's come up on social media and since Tiago
[807.04 - 812.48] P:1530.46 E:0.065001 |  returned to Liverpool starting that from January the fourth, he's made 20 fouls, no other players
[812.48 - 818.08] P:1569.98 E:0.070453 |  made more. Ball has been won back on the halfway line by Jones, Jones turned it in field but it was
[818.08 - 824.08] P:1607.74 E:0.067561 |  behind Firmino so that's slow deliverable momentum, here's Tiago who Robbie was talking about there,
[824.08 - 829.76] P:1499.48 E:0.065823 |  committing that early foul on Gunderwain and receiving the yellow card, so a long time for
[830.40 - 836.48] P:1467.35 E:0.067528 |  him to play in the engine room with a yellow card. Was that ooo because of the stats on
[836.48 - 844.32] P:1527.89 E:0.060295 |  because they were Liverpool were breaking? Both, both, yes an early yellow card and have to cope
[844.32 - 850.32] P:1466.64 E:0.070730 |  with that in midfield, that must bring back a few memories Robbie, Jones, mind you you were,
[851.28 - 854.64] P:1455.45 E:0.074151 |  you know you were a master weren't you, getting the early yellow card and then not,
[854.64 - 860.08] P:1554.51 E:0.062008 |  not getting the red, here's Tiago, playing it out to the left hand side, taken down by Robertson,
[860.08 - 864.40] P:1511.42 E:0.061447 |  Robertson with a high ball into the six yard box, a stretch by Edison but a comfortable catch.
[866.08 - 869.84] P:1646.42 E:0.072010 |  Yeah good possession from Liverpool there just keeping the ball Tiago,
[870.72 - 872.48] P:1623.63 E:0.068517 |  getting on it trying to dictate the plate.
[872.64 - 883.84] P:1403.76 E:0.061169 |  Edison's just going to roll it back to Diaz, now he was reading Jimmy Carriga's newspaper column
[883.84 - 889.76] P:1465.70 E:0.068973 |  yesterday he was putting Diaz forward as a lead and contender for the player of the year this season,
[890.40 - 899.44] P:1389.46 E:0.064202 |  he has Joe, at Stones playing it forward, in the sides Tiago on Bernardo Silva,
[899.52 - 904.24] P:1451.69 E:0.068858 |  he just pulled the ball away from him, he was sliding in there, I think Bernardo Silva done well
[904.24 - 911.04] P:1450.73 E:0.064029 |  he's just seen Tiago come and just used his body, well but he did dive in Tiago didn't he on a
[911.04 - 915.84] P:1652.66 E:0.066625 |  yellow card, that's that surprised me actually you know what you wouldn't associate Tiago,
[916.40 - 920.00] P:1750.49 E:0.067476 |  you know making so many fouls because he's so beautiful when he gets the ball,
[920.56 - 926.16] P:1521.03 E:0.066498 |  but if he if he just slightly missed time back that would have been Liverpool down to 10 men in
[926.16 - 930.64] P:1538.34 E:0.070307 |  the first quarter of an hour, however Diaz Márez playing it into the penalty area headed away
[930.64 - 936.64] P:1521.40 E:0.068416 |  by Fabinho, bounces out in the day, Wijnaldum hooks it over the head of Bernardo Silva and then
[936.64 - 941.92] P:1569.35 E:0.065015 |  he's shoved off the ball as he tries to reach it ahead of Rodri, so it's a free kick to Liverpool
[941.92 - 946.08] P:1501.44 E:0.074374 |  halfway inside the wrong half. That was brilliant from Wijnaldum wasn't it John, the skill and then
[946.08 - 952.80] P:1516.14 E:0.062230 |  the ability to move away from a challenge and then got fouled just relieving you know the pressure
[952.80 - 959.60] P:1436.27 E:0.060905 |  on Liverpool. It was lovely play by Wijnaldum, flicked it over the head of Bernardo Silva,
[959.60 - 966.96] P:1470.40 E:0.064611 |  Liverpool nil, Manchester City nil, City winning the ball back from Tiago, cancelo it was and now
[966.96 - 972.96] P:1559.87 E:0.068663 |  Bernardo Silva running in field, it's taken on by Márez but Jones does well for Liverpool,
[972.96 - 979.60] P:1497.60 E:0.070244 |  now 20 years old, a teenager no longer Curtis Jones, Robertson on the left for Liverpool plays
[979.76 - 985.36] P:1489.23 E:0.070368 |  forward, that's intercepted by Rodri, he does really well against Firmino, just held off the
[985.36 - 992.40] P:1368.86 E:0.061915 |  challenge, played it in field where Diaz works it out with the left hand side to Izinchenko and
[992.40 - 998.80] P:1520.99 E:0.063868 |  now Sterling in field from him to Fulton, she just switched on, Phil Fulton is playing as the
[999.84 - 1004.72] P:1569.74 E:0.073074 |  false nine, Gabriel Gézous only on the bench today despite the fact he scored two goals in his
[1004.80 - 1011.52] P:1666.62 E:0.063899 |  last two appearances, Gabriel Gézous including one of the goals in midweek in what was City's 13th
[1011.52 - 1016.56] P:1395.30 E:0.066771 |  win in a row, Izinchenko playing the ball over the top but it's headed down by Alexander Arnold
[1016.56 - 1022.08] P:1685.10 E:0.066689 |  and now Salah nice change of feet from him up towards Firmino but that's strong, strong and
[1022.08 - 1027.44] P:1614.27 E:0.071770 |  very good defensive work in the centre field and now Márez is off and running, skips round one
[1027.44 - 1031.44] P:1662.34 E:0.065033 |  challenge, skips round another, plays it back, Gundawan works it towards the left hand side,
[1031.44 - 1035.28] P:1573.80 E:0.072166 |  Sterling with a little bit of space there, Alexander Arnold is onto him, Sterling's into the
[1035.28 - 1041.44] P:1543.45 E:0.065279 |  box, excellent, excellent tackle from Alexander Arnold, whipped the ball away from Raheem Sterling
[1041.44 - 1047.76] P:1464.08 E:0.062439 |  as clean as a whistle and now Salah has the ball 10 yards inside Manchester City Territory beginning
[1047.76 - 1054.56] P:1434.48 E:0.061900 |  to warm up here at Anfield. Brilliant defending from Trent Alexander-Arnold, John was it one of
[1054.56 - 1059.60] P:1498.93 E:0.064143 |  one, Sterling into the box, had to make the challenge, it was a fantastic challenge but then you look
[1059.60 - 1065.36] P:1569.87 E:0.062851 |  at City you know in transition Diaz has run forward, Rodry just sat in as a centre half next to
[1065.36 - 1070.32] P:1450.48 E:0.066525 |  Stones and that nullified the counter-attack of Liverpool. Yeah and Sterling was at pace there
[1070.32 - 1074.88] P:1445.46 E:0.068561 |  as well, great defending, yeah running at Alexander Arnold, he had to get that right but he did
[1075.52 - 1081.36] P:1368.87 E:0.067054 |  so it is 0-0 Liverpool 0 Manchester City 0 and while Manchester City have been going win after
[1081.36 - 1087.84] P:1420.31 E:0.064737 |  win after win Liverpool have won only three of their last 10 matches in all competitions,
[1088.48 - 1093.92] P:1499.15 E:0.067025 |  not scored in their last three games here at Anfield. They never lost three home games in the
[1093.92 - 1101.28] P:1421.03 E:0.055611 |  run in the Premier League either John, this could be a first today. It could and it is currently
[1101.28 - 1108.48] P:1433.32 E:0.063721 |  0-0, Stones chipping the ball away towards Foden who under pressure headed it back,
[1108.48 - 1114.48] P:1531.76 E:0.064508 |  Cancelo is in there in front of the penalty area, now Bernardo Silva Liverpool pressing
[1114.48 - 1120.56] P:1484.57 E:0.070447 |  Manchester City but Manchester City playing out a bit or are they? Foden's caught in possession,
[1120.56 - 1125.92] P:1645.21 E:0.063800 |  wanted a free kick, no free kick, Manny and Thiago but then Bernardo Silva to the rescue
[1125.92 - 1130.32] P:1405.93 E:0.063873 |  for Manchester City he's got the ball back and he plays it back into his own penalty area.
[1130.32 - 1137.52] P:1603.43 E:0.065490 |  Hasn't got going John yet has it? Not quite yet, it's very tight and as Robbie Savage has been
[1137.52 - 1144.32] P:1422.29 E:0.064488 |  saying certainly capically it is it's very interesting, hardly any space out there at all
[1145.04 - 1150.40] P:1292.80 E:0.060900 |  and Manchester City with the ball in front of their own penalty area playing it out towards the
[1151.12 - 1159.76] P:1445.80 E:0.068397 |  left hand side where Diaz receives it back from Rodgerie Diaz in danger of losing it and indeed
[1159.76 - 1167.12] P:1480.71 E:0.063407 |  under pressure very nearly gave it away however City still have it, Gunduan then gives it to Bernardo
[1167.12 - 1172.80] P:1612.54 E:0.068148 |  Silva now he has Mares down the right hand side three City players inside the box, Mares is challenged
[1172.80 - 1179.04] P:1459.67 E:0.068562 |  well by Robertson, Cancelo Bernardo Silva back to Mares now in the full back position, Curling
[1179.04 - 1184.32] P:1619.60 E:0.070083 |  left footed across headed away by Fabinho comes out, oh Salas lost it, Banstoff, Imzenchenko is all
[1184.32 - 1190.96] P:1718.63 E:0.061912 |  over it, Sterling now, Sterling tries to thread it across the box but it's blocked by Curtis Jones
[1190.96 - 1196.00] P:1477.50 E:0.068055 |  inside his own penalty area and Liverpool are able to to get it away to the halfway line but
[1196.00 - 1202.24] P:1670.00 E:0.068983 |  Mane trying, Mane was all on his own on the halfway line only succeeded in losing possession
[1202.24 - 1208.88] P:1391.46 E:0.059192 |  and now City bring it forward again, Imzenchenko City with Sterling, Gunduan again, Gunduan turning
[1208.88 - 1214.72] P:1391.52 E:0.065678 |  Liverpool three men around him so City are very happy to go back into this centre circle here
[1214.72 - 1220.00] P:1627.60 E:0.066290 |  and switch the direction of play to the right hand side still goalless here at Anfield almost 20
[1220.48 - 1228.08] P:1415.97 E:0.062981 |  minutes played, Bernardo Silva, this cold wind that's blowing around the ground just ruffling the
[1228.08 - 1236.16] P:1464.30 E:0.060520 |  shirts of the City players and then Dias gets it all wrong with a pass from just Fordham left
[1236.16 - 1242.48] P:1373.03 E:0.063301 |  of the centre circle that he over hits massively way out of play landed in the on the canvases in
[1242.48 - 1247.12] P:1460.71 E:0.073257 |  the lower tier of the Serkene d'Alvistam and as soon as he hit it he immediately looked over his
[1247.12 - 1254.80] P:1511.19 E:0.056380 |  shoulder down to the pitch at Anfield that must have been that massive divot, I don't know what
[1254.80 - 1261.28] P:1585.80 E:0.070796 |  happened there, 20 up passes though, I was going to say the pitches must have been like that when I played
[1263.12 - 1270.40] P:1426.41 E:0.062384 |  Liverpool nil Manchester City nil Fabinho heads it away on the edge of the box and the ball
[1271.04 - 1274.32] P:1504.46 E:0.069316 |  eventually bounces out for a throwing to Liverpool in their own right back area
[1275.20 - 1278.08] P:1442.01 E:0.072092 |  Fabinho missed the last three matches Fabinho
[1279.84 - 1285.68] P:1348.60 E:0.065322 |  there's Wijnaldum now and then Alexander-Arnold gets right behind that but skies it actually
[1285.68 - 1290.96] P:1520.29 E:0.067617 |  so City played forward Gundawang low lovely touch Fordham back to Gundawang important interception
[1290.96 - 1296.72] P:1609.53 E:0.065586 |  back in there from Curtis Jones City looking very dangerous around the Liverpool penalty area
[1297.36 - 1301.36] P:1639.20 E:0.067334 |  Wijnaldum breaks away with the ball shrugs off the challenge Liverpool
[1301.92 - 1307.76] P:1464.84 E:0.068752 |  there dangerous front three are all available Salah on the right hand side receives it from Wijnaldum
[1308.56 - 1315.04] P:1545.17 E:0.066782 |  Alexander-Arnold back to Salah Curtis Jones to London ever so well done he was a one to track
[1315.04 - 1322.32] P:1491.60 E:0.061417 |  the run great defensive midfield play then Wijnaldum showing you know good strength
[1324.08 - 1330.64] P:1581.25 E:0.065816 |  to shrug off and fill Fordham but how many final third entries have we had from either side John
[1330.64 - 1334.40] P:1318.99 E:0.067097 |  and no attempts on target it's not been that many is there no not made a note yet has there been a
[1334.40 - 1342.88] P:1414.39 E:0.058734 |  shot on target no City I think carrying the greatest threat at the moment Wijnaldum in center field
[1343.84 - 1350.40] P:1382.06 E:0.063910 |  seems almost unthinkable that he would not be a Liverpool player next season but it seems very
[1350.40 - 1355.52] P:1400.75 E:0.070913 |  likely that'll be the case Wijnaldum out of contract at the end of the season Liverpool nil Manchester
[1356.24 - 1358.24] P:1571.53 E:0.074869 |  let's get back to Wales Ireland and Gareth Lewis
[1359.36 - 1366.48] P:1619.61 E:0.075470 |  but Wales still leading by 21 points to 16 now a penalty from Billy Burns for Ireland has made it
[1366.48 - 1372.24] P:1733.99 E:0.075362 |  a nervous final seven minutes or so here in Cardiff when P back the Wales coach chasing a rare win
[1372.24 - 1378.32] P:1655.94 E:0.069347 |  against one of the big boys Ireland looking for on a first away win under their head coach Andy Farrell
[1378.32 - 1383.04] P:1684.75 E:0.073323 |  it's nervous stuff Ireland down to 14 from the 13th minute of the game after Peter Omani was set
[1383.04 - 1389.44] P:1647.94 E:0.064629 |  off as a stand-off well to just enough 21 16 they lead you can hear the the final minutes of the
[1389.44 - 1397.44] P:1546.14 E:0.060895 |  match with Gareth and James Hook and Tommy Ball over on five live sports extra right now here on
[1397.44 - 1405.60] P:1594.58 E:0.062552 |  five live the Premier League the big match Liverpool nil Manchester City nil enthralling stuff but
[1405.60 - 1411.60] P:1519.26 E:0.063985 |  without any end product so we're halfway through the first half and it's still no no
[1413.12 - 1418.56] P:1638.64 E:0.069608 |  I heard Thomas Tuchel John talking about a final third recoveries you know pressing out the park
[1418.56 - 1423.36] P:1431.32 E:0.066534 |  and City have done that quite well final third recovery has to go forward Gundogan couldn't
[1423.36 - 1427.52] P:1464.53 E:0.069438 |  find the pass out to the left hand side as in Czenko who puts his palms apart over there on the
[1427.52 - 1433.36] P:1514.78 E:0.062826 |  far side wondering why that that ball couldn't be delivered by Gundogan and then Wijnaldum
[1433.36 - 1440.08] P:1511.44 E:0.067741 |  is fouled a little foul from behind by Bernardo Silva who hairs back into position center field
[1440.08 - 1446.64] P:1328.72 E:0.064566 |  pre-kicked a Liverpool half inside their own half so it is nil nil I think the temperature is
[1446.64 - 1451.36] P:1518.84 E:0.070672 |  dipping the winds are going to increase I've been glued to the weather forecast over the course of
[1451.36 - 1458.16] P:1691.07 E:0.068091 |  the last week snow is you've been glued to the weather for really because I was I was worried
[1458.16 - 1465.28] P:1358.94 E:0.059919 |  about this weekend with the snow big forecast anyway we're okay at the moment here's Fabinho
[1465.84 - 1469.68] P:1560.05 E:0.073483 |  it's like Ian Dennis who puts the wind up with me it must be an interesting house of
[1469.68 - 1474.56] P:1441.46 E:0.064241 |  ludes to the weather forecast it's Ian Ian's in contact with me all the time he's out of the
[1474.56 - 1480.80] P:1345.64 E:0.055519 |  snow forecast tomorrow just be careful you'll be all right you haven't got far to go home
[1480.80 - 1486.40] P:1368.81 E:0.063191 |  here's Henderson long ball from the back and then Czenko gets his head to it it's
[1486.96 - 1492.48] P:1576.29 E:0.068372 |  kept in play on the far side by Alexander Arnold Alexander Arnold against Czenko beats him to
[1492.48 - 1499.60] P:1624.21 E:0.066996 |  the line then plays it in and Mane just outside the six-yard box just stabbed his header a yard
[1499.60 - 1504.56] P:1538.09 E:0.062449 |  over the top first big chance of the game I think Maneu did I'll be disappointed he hasn't at the
[1504.56 - 1511.76] P:1575.56 E:0.064406 |  target there it's great play from Trent Alexander Arnold on that right hand side you know it's a
[1511.76 - 1517.60] P:1671.91 E:0.069358 |  diagonal ball he keeps the ball in ever so well so great desire then beats the fall back and then
[1517.60 - 1523.12] P:1682.54 E:0.062680 |  just drives it towards you know the penalty spot in between the penalty spot on the six-yard
[1523.12 - 1529.68] P:1640.36 E:0.066082 |  line central and Maneu gets the run on the defender and can sell up I think he's got to do better there
[1529.68 - 1535.68] P:1529.49 E:0.062247 |  John first big chance he could have allowed it to bounce out of play Alexander Arnold but he was
[1535.68 - 1542.24] P:1512.74 E:0.066840 |  decisive seized the initiative and it nearly worked for Liverpool and now Maneu is in an offside position
[1542.24 - 1545.84] P:1548.11 E:0.070034 |  just while you're talking there Robbie as well did you see Gundewan had a little nibble back at
[1545.84 - 1552.24] P:1500.64 E:0.068588 |  Thiago a little foul on the halfway line took his opportunity just to get one back after Thiago's
[1552.24 - 1558.56] P:1507.73 E:0.064162 |  earlier foul on Gundewan you know 61% possession from Man City but the first big chance of the game
[1558.56 - 1567.04] P:1437.97 E:0.057567 |  for Liverpool John yeah Maneu with the the header over the top ball is back with Allyson who even though
[1567.04 - 1572.64] P:1618.56 E:0.069048 |  he's got folding just three four yards away from him just steps back and then chips the ball out
[1572.72 - 1576.72] P:1636.75 E:0.071267 |  and finds Robertson down the left-hand side Robertson's ball into the right back position
[1576.72 - 1581.12] P:1602.39 E:0.070097 |  Stones plays it across to the the Brazilian goalkeeper at the other end Edison all in green
[1581.76 - 1586.00] P:1549.31 E:0.068963 |  long high left footed clearance Stirling got a shove in the back from Alexander Arnold there
[1586.96 - 1593.28] P:1454.45 E:0.066301 |  but it's given only as a throw in which Alexander Arnold takes probably ten yards away from
[1594.32 - 1598.56] P:1541.54 E:0.065622 |  where the ball actually went out of play usually the officials are red hot on that sort of thing
[1599.52 - 1606.08] P:1419.97 E:0.065842 |  wasn't closer to the opponent's goal however here's Henderson and front of his own penalty area plays
[1606.08 - 1612.96] P:1478.79 E:0.058931 |  it across to Fabinho it's Henderson and Phillips the other evening against Brighton when Brighton
[1612.96 - 1621.44] P:1391.15 E:0.060600 |  played so well here defended brilliantly ball at the back with the shaven headed Brazilian Fabinho
[1621.44 - 1626.80] P:1353.74 E:0.070002 |  then up to Thiago and now Wine Aldam Wine Aldam looking for Robertson down the left hand side
[1626.80 - 1630.24] P:1474.22 E:0.071069 |  Robertson with space in front of him but he goes in field towards Sadio Mane
[1630.24 - 1637.84] P:1425.59 E:0.064682 |  Firmino comes short uses Wine Aldam though and then Thiago Liverpool with possession inside the
[1637.84 - 1642.80] P:1504.04 E:0.070988 |  Manchester City half they've not had a great deal of that so far and it's been given away by Thiago
[1642.80 - 1648.64] P:1699.40 E:0.069147 |  and folding now folding passes the ball into the path of Márez Sadio Mane came back in with a challenge
[1648.64 - 1654.64] P:1526.28 E:0.065559 |  just did enough to nudge over Márez and it's a free kick to Manchester City for the right-hand
[1654.64 - 1660.48] P:1469.37 E:0.065516 |  side here 30 yards out yeah Mane doing his defensive work there running back but it was one
[1660.48 - 1665.84] P:1644.52 E:0.067901 |  of those where you know like the David Louise sending off where he's just trying to stop his run
[1665.84 - 1671.28] P:1573.65 E:0.065535 |  and his knee clips Márez obviously you know 40 yards out wide therefore it's going to be a
[1672.08 - 1680.96] P:1432.75 E:0.055452 |  free kick to Manchester City Jürgen Klopp down there very warmly wrapped up he's got his long
[1681.04 - 1687.92] P:1517.87 E:0.069426 |  padded coat he's got a black wee hat on gloves and he's watching Manchester City placing this
[1687.92 - 1695.28] P:1525.43 E:0.062092 |  free kick a one-man wall a salar shaped Liverpool wall Gundawang is going to take this
[1696.16 - 1700.64] P:1476.98 E:0.071919 |  Liverpool holding their line on the edge of the box Gundawang ships it in over everyone
[1700.64 - 1705.12] P:1603.57 E:0.066355 |  and it bounces away out of play for a throwing near the corner flag yeah they try to look for
[1705.12 - 1710.80] P:1481.91 E:0.067254 |  Rodry so Liverpool holding the 18 yard line the ball wide on this right hand side Rodry
[1710.80 - 1716.72] P:1413.21 E:0.057226 |  made a run from deep to get round the back but the pass was overhead so it's a throwing
[1717.52 - 1723.92] P:1453.44 E:0.067087 |  to Liverpool over there on the far side too far away from the cop with all of the various Liverpool
[1723.92 - 1730.08] P:1424.27 E:0.067078 |  supporters Banner's direct over the seats there's Sadio Mane inside his own half a little foul
[1730.08 - 1735.44] P:1498.47 E:0.061441 |  kicks the free kick the ball might have been moving there as well and indeed it was because Michael
[1735.44 - 1740.32] P:1603.49 E:0.072043 |  Oliver says no I can't let you away with that it's got to come back by the letter of the law
[1740.80 - 1745.36] P:1424.25 E:0.067714 |  we've got a lot of letter of the law going on haven't we this season here's Henderson
[1745.92 - 1752.32] P:1616.60 E:0.069766 |  Henderson to Fabinho surely John that's Succek Redcat will be overturned surely they have
[1752.32 - 1758.88] P:1351.83 E:0.060782 |  appealed against it I think what largely went unsaid about that was the fact that Mitrovich
[1758.88 - 1764.80] P:1626.59 E:0.067067 |  didn't cover himself in glory there by any means might be part of the simulation game tonight
[1764.80 - 1770.00] P:1569.67 E:0.064525 |  well I would I would like to think so Robbie with you and Chris from well I presume it would be
[1770.00 - 1775.84] P:1560.83 E:0.060119 |  just after nine o'clock tonight after the the Sheffield United Chelsea commentary you're getting
[1775.84 - 1782.00] P:1495.76 E:0.068895 |  used to your late Sunday nights aren't you here's Mane that challenge well by Cancelot Mane went
[1782.00 - 1786.64] P:1608.65 E:0.069551 |  down suggesting it was a free kick referee Oliver Lau plays to continue Henderson's ball over the top
[1786.64 - 1792.32] P:1590.98 E:0.063348 |  but that was well watched by Diaz comes out for me no with a shot and Edison had to be sharp there
[1792.32 - 1797.28] P:1647.21 E:0.065252 |  little steps to his left pushed it over the top of the crossbar it was bang on target from Firmino
[1797.28 - 1801.60] P:1608.25 E:0.066080 |  Jordan Henderson brilliant there the ball up to Fordon he was on the front foot he got there in
[1801.60 - 1807.28] P:1652.83 E:0.062161 |  front of Fordon the only look for the run it was a ball over the top Salah just couldn't quite get
[1807.28 - 1813.44] P:1633.05 E:0.066858 |  him he was a good defensive header and then Firmino going towards the touch line spins hits it on the
[1813.44 - 1820.80] P:1384.61 E:0.058832 |  volley and Edison at that near post palms it over great technique from Firmino corner
[1820.80 - 1824.80] P:1694.91 E:0.073698 |  four Liverpool first corner of the match it is nil nil the score here it is into the edge of the
[1824.80 - 1829.60] P:1685.26 E:0.070397 |  six yard box Diaz was there to head it away all Fordon has done well Fordon takes it on he's
[1829.60 - 1834.96] P:1746.26 E:0.069522 |  beaten Alexander Arnold and then the final covering challenge from Liverpool's from Curtis Jones and
[1834.96 - 1841.52] P:1549.31 E:0.069414 |  he was the last man but he timed his run brilliantly and took the ball away from Phil Fordon who if
[1841.52 - 1845.60] P:1595.45 E:0.070174 |  he'd been unable to do that it would have been a clear run through for Fordon. Talking about the two
[1845.60 - 1850.56] P:1478.74 E:0.064373 |  youngsters before the game weren't we and that was a great example of desire from you know two
[1850.56 - 1856.96] P:1694.54 E:0.066831 |  fantastic players Phil Fordon great skill then Curtis Jones the energy and the desire to run back
[1856.96 - 1863.92] P:1454.45 E:0.058818 |  if he wasn't there big problems for for Liverpool. Yep Jones the the Liverpoolian the Liverpool fan
[1864.56 - 1871.92] P:1526.24 E:0.063637 |  against the Stockport lad Phil Fordon the Manchester City fan and Liverpool and Jones came out on top
[1871.92 - 1882.56] P:1507.56 E:0.058920 |  there how quick was Jones then very quick had to be as well nil nil Liverpool have created the two
[1882.56 - 1888.24] P:1551.96 E:0.067704 |  clearest chances so far despite the early promise from Manchester City manne with his header over
[1888.24 - 1895.28] P:1560.34 E:0.066386 |  Firmino with the volley that was comfortably saved in the end by Edison the helicopter with its light
[1895.28 - 1900.64] P:1498.02 E:0.070234 |  on this heading our way as Alexander Arnold crosses from the right hand side that's headed up
[1900.64 - 1907.44] P:1603.78 E:0.063500 |  Edison comes and catches the ball in front of his throat high above Sadio Manne and the danger has
[1907.44 - 1912.32] P:1455.24 E:0.066719 |  gone. Then you can see that Liverpool now coming into the game you know the possession stats are
[1912.32 - 1917.92] P:1508.34 E:0.067699 |  51-49 now just in City's favour so they are getting more possession you know they're getting the ball
[1917.92 - 1923.68] P:1533.56 E:0.062760 |  out wide they're starting to create one or two good situations in City's final third. And I think
[1924.40 - 1930.48] P:1515.51 E:0.068056 |  what's encouraging or what will encourage Jurgen Klopp and Liverpool supporters is that Alexander
[1930.48 - 1937.12] P:1465.71 E:0.064973 |  Arnold is coming into the game there already put a couple of very good balls in from the right hand
[1937.12 - 1943.20] P:1278.66 E:0.064024 |  side you know that's been something that's been missing really for Liverpool that that delivery
[1943.20 - 1949.28] P:1520.76 E:0.066966 |  from the right and the left from Alexander Arnold and Robertson by their high standards here is
[1949.28 - 1953.84] P:1691.24 E:0.067908 |  Robertson now crossing that's a good ball in but Zincenko is able to come across Firmino couldn't
[1953.84 - 1960.40] P:1430.80 E:0.059499 |  get a meaningful touch on it the bounces down in the City right back area Firmino back through
[1960.48 - 1966.16] P:1365.32 E:0.065384 |  Robertson and Jones towards the halfway line that helicopter continues to to buzz around
[1967.28 - 1973.52] P:1534.19 E:0.072375 |  way over the top of the Sarkany Dalglish stand. Liverpool now Manchester City now
[1974.08 - 1979.76] P:1453.34 E:0.067593 |  near in the the final whistle in the Wales Ireland game Wales just in front Alexander
[1979.76 - 1985.68] P:1546.22 E:0.065608 |  Arnold curling the ball across and then across comes John Stones to get his head to it and Zincenko
[1985.68 - 1989.60] P:1556.87 E:0.064985 |  can't keep it in on the dead ball line it's a corner to Liverpool. It's a good job Stones did
[1989.60 - 1994.16] P:1587.67 E:0.068122 |  come across and headed John because he was into a great area the ball landing central on the six
[1994.16 - 2001.28] P:1477.00 E:0.060959 |  yard line Edison come out he's nowhere near it I tell you Hedneson's playing well John from that
[2001.28 - 2007.44] P:1464.73 E:0.062767 |  centre half position playing very very well. Another corner from the far side the right and again
[2007.44 - 2012.08] P:1535.98 E:0.068782 |  it's Robertson who's going to take this rather than Alexander Arnold so it's the in-swinger from
[2012.08 - 2017.52] P:1533.34 E:0.070718 |  the far side and Robertson raises his right arm here it is the delivery into the six yard box
[2017.52 - 2023.60] P:1464.91 E:0.061645 |  but it comes up ahead of Rodgery and he glances it into the opposite full back position and it
[2023.60 - 2030.32] P:1396.35 E:0.060998 |  bounces out for a throwing to Liverpool. Henderson is going to leave this for Robertson to take
[2030.32 - 2036.32] P:1405.41 E:0.065065 |  Robertson making his way across from the far side Henderson drops it and bounces up really enjoyed
[2036.32 - 2041.60] P:1392.99 E:0.065947 |  listening to Trent Alexander Arnold talking about Jordan Henderson and his influence and his presence
[2042.16 - 2049.68] P:1339.09 E:0.060976 |  around the club the captain and Fabinho in the centre circle Fabinho playing it through towards
[2050.40 - 2056.24] P:1300.60 E:0.066110 |  Firmino but it's clear to win Liverpool with Alexander Arnold finds Salah on the far side Salah
[2057.12 - 2063.68] P:1471.23 E:0.070338 |  further infield towards Wijnaldum and now Firmino and now Salah Jones takes it up as well
[2063.68 - 2068.88] P:1513.44 E:0.067879 |  in the middle of the Manchester City half this is more like Liverpool more like the champions
[2069.44 - 2076.56] P:1464.93 E:0.065835 |  Thiago to the left hand side Robertson Robertson back to Thiago Thiago plays it across to Salah
[2076.56 - 2081.76] P:1638.66 E:0.069992 |  who tees up Jones who plays it through into the box but Stirling excellent recovery from Stirling
[2082.80 - 2086.80] P:1506.35 E:0.071827 |  sensing the danger and he was in there to get to the ball before it could reach Alexander
[2086.80 - 2091.44] P:1565.67 E:0.067726 |  Arnold but here's Robertson now on the left hand side Liverpool are cranking up the pressure here
[2091.44 - 2098.64] P:1427.02 E:0.061984 |  Thiago turns gives it back towards Henderson closer towards the halfway line Jones Jones
[2098.64 - 2105.76] P:1468.20 E:0.065242 |  turns between Foden and Stirling and gives it out to Alexander Arnold who looks for Jones
[2105.76 - 2110.32] P:1359.49 E:0.071892 |  Jones is there and will go back into the centre circle having the best spell now Robbie he wants
[2110.32 - 2115.44] P:1516.96 E:0.062921 |  to get on the ball all the time doesn't he Curtis Jones in that midfield area yeah confidence stuff
[2116.08 - 2120.80] P:1498.00 E:0.073494 |  just wants to get in between the lines on the half turn to look to go forward all the time plays
[2120.80 - 2127.92] P:1468.35 E:0.062652 |  in the half space ever so well still no nail on five live with just over 10 minutes to go
[2127.92 - 2134.96] P:1435.44 E:0.063798 |  to half time will have more on Wales Ireland in a moment or two that can that can only be
[2134.96 - 2143.84] P:1648.37 E:0.064547 |  seconds left in the Six Nations match the three o'clock kickoff still Wales 21 Ireland 16
[2145.04 - 2151.68] P:1353.13 E:0.063654 |  here in Liverpool with Wine Alden giving it out to Robertson on the left hand side now back to Jones
[2152.56 - 2158.24] P:1568.79 E:0.065280 |  looks up uses Sadio Manet who turns Rodry comes across and then because of that
[2158.24 - 2163.60] P:1587.85 E:0.063372 |  Manet gives it straight to Gunda Wang and then Foden is fouled in the centre circle and it's a
[2163.60 - 2171.28] P:1387.09 E:0.065541 |  free kick to Manchester City and we've seen the momentum swing from City who had the better
[2171.28 - 2176.16] P:1541.47 E:0.064817 |  of it earlier on to Liverpool who've had the better spell over the course of the last 15 minutes
[2176.16 - 2181.68] P:1500.31 E:0.061357 |  yeah they haven't been a threat have they at all Man City you know no shots to trouble
[2181.68 - 2186.72] P:1431.08 E:0.064169 |  Alison yet you know maybe might be a just five minutes to go before half time just put forward
[2186.72 - 2192.56] P:1297.55 E:0.063053 |  not left hand side put Stern as a set the forward they've been very rigid you know forward and you
[2192.56 - 2196.40] P:1556.22 E:0.068157 |  usually see City when they change positions they've all really stuck to their positions
[2198.72 - 2202.64] P:1469.22 E:0.075995 |  here's Gunda Wang on the left hand side finds Sterling Sterling up against Alexander
[2202.64 - 2206.96] P:1653.05 E:0.074752 |  Arnold again Sterling goes past him now up against Fabinho oh he goes down it's a penalty
[2207.68 - 2213.12] P:1657.91 E:0.070968 |  Fabinho came in with a challenge Sterling was sent tumbling and referee Michael Oliver who was
[2213.12 - 2220.08] P:1632.52 E:0.060436 |  well positioned there pointed straight to the penalty spot Tiago asks the question Henderson
[2220.08 - 2226.40] P:1573.32 E:0.063603 |  comes across but these are these are not it's not an angry Liverpool they are asking the question
[2226.40 - 2233.36] P:1518.02 E:0.060814 |  but the penalties being given Sterling I think what's happened is as Sterling does ever so well
[2233.36 - 2240.88] P:1576.08 E:0.061383 |  drives past Alexander Arnold drives drives into the box and then it's Fabinho's training leg as he
[2240.88 - 2249.28] P:1565.94 E:0.056620 |  jumps he sticks his you know a leg out and catches Sterling I think it's a definite penalty so it's
[2249.28 - 2255.20] P:1604.60 E:0.067949 |  a penalty to Manchester City so City have now been awarded penalties in four of the last six
[2255.20 - 2262.00] P:1574.74 E:0.064674 |  league meetings they've missed two of the last three against Liverpool remember Marez here a couple
[2262.00 - 2267.36] P:1429.46 E:0.069826 |  of years ago remember De Bruyne missing at the Eddie Had earlier this season well this time it's
[2267.36 - 2276.16] P:1522.39 E:0.062189 |  Gunda Wang who's missed only one penalty in his career Gunda Wang right footed against Allison oh
[2276.16 - 2284.08] P:1619.90 E:0.065891 |  he's put it over the top he's missed the top left corner and the ball lands in the cop and it stays
[2284.16 - 2292.72] P:1651.57 E:0.070163 |  Liverpool 0 Manchester City 0 and remarkably City have now missed three of their last four penalties
[2292.72 - 2303.04] P:1470.98 E:0.059228 |  against Liverpool wow short run up wasn't it went for power pulls it over the bar like wow
[2305.04 - 2309.76] P:1556.17 E:0.072464 |  what a miss that is what is with City in penalties against Liverpool John
[2310.72 - 2318.64] P:1402.84 E:0.057528 |  I'm amazed by that and that missed by quite a distance there's probably a yard over the top
[2318.64 - 2324.56] P:1436.74 E:0.065078 |  that is a massive let-off for Liverpool it's still 0-0 and what an opportunity missed by
[2324.56 - 2331.28] P:1639.00 E:0.066823 |  Manchester City and by Gunda Wang the final whistle has gone in Cardiff it has finished
[2331.44 - 2339.44] P:1665.25 E:0.064452 |  it has finished Wales 21 Ireland 16 more at halftime but here's Robertson Robertson's ball in
[2339.44 - 2344.88] P:1637.08 E:0.065261 |  towards Salah who chests it down but the chest down took it away from him and Manchester City are
[2344.88 - 2349.84] P:1613.80 E:0.068477 |  able to clear through stones actually plays it off Manning and it bounces behind for a goal kick
[2349.84 - 2355.04] P:1548.96 E:0.065012 |  and the body language of the Manchester City players you can it's written all over them
[2355.04 - 2360.40] P:1572.26 E:0.070267 |  frustration that they had the chance there to take the lead seven minutes to go to halftime
[2361.28 - 2366.88] P:1418.37 E:0.064203 |  and they weren't able to take it it was great play wasn't it from Raheem Sterling no there was one
[2366.88 - 2371.76] P:1562.71 E:0.067614 |  moment early in the halftime when he run at Trent Alexander-Arnold it was great tackle wasn't it
[2371.76 - 2377.28] P:1467.47 E:0.067035 |  on this occasion he went past Alexander-Arnold and Fabino stuck his leg out was a penalty
[2377.28 - 2385.52] P:1485.38 E:0.059606 |  then Gunda Wang short run up smashes it pulls it over the bar full of confidence
[2385.52 - 2392.48] P:1510.45 E:0.068814 |  and Silke Gunda Wang he's never scored as many goals in any season in his career as he has this
[2392.48 - 2397.68] P:1594.58 E:0.070274 |  season that would have taken him to double figures as I say only missed one penalty in his career
[2397.68 - 2403.68] P:1514.91 E:0.063283 |  before that was against Tottenham last season if you remember but has scored from the spot this season
[2404.72 - 2411.28] P:1460.41 E:0.065523 |  but there he went for the top left corner as he looked at it and it was probably at least a couple
[2411.76 - 2415.84] P:1483.03 E:0.062183 |  possibly a yard over the top and the ball landed halfway up the cop
[2417.60 - 2424.96] P:1473.74 E:0.065436 |  Liverpool 0 Manchester City 0 just over five minutes to go to halftime now Jones plays it in field
[2426.16 - 2433.36] P:1389.73 E:0.066009 |  and then back to Fabinho who conceded the penalty Raheem Sterling winning it with his trickery
[2434.32 - 2441.44] P:1508.67 E:0.067806 |  the he's had a couple of runs like that Sterling the former Liverpool man remember into the
[2441.44 - 2447.60] P:1551.42 E:0.068577 |  Liverpool penalty area as Liverpool win it back from Bernardo Silva for Mino up towards Salah
[2447.60 - 2453.20] P:1502.98 E:0.065461 |  Salah tried to work it through to Manet but it was cut out on the edge of the box by Diaz and
[2453.20 - 2459.92] P:1586.37 E:0.070284 |  Cancelo just well in a very tight position there against Thiago and still drags the ball back
[2459.92 - 2466.08] P:1533.21 E:0.063214 |  plays it past Thiago now Bernardo Silva back to Cancelo again and then Cancelo plays it central
[2466.08 - 2470.64] P:1555.90 E:0.066997 |  leader Gundawan who heads it back to the edge of his own penalty area you've got to say John Sterling
[2470.64 - 2475.60] P:1545.31 E:0.069152 |  so dangerous isn't he when he gets on the run and drives into the box I think no players got more
[2475.60 - 2480.80] P:1620.91 E:0.067532 |  penalty since 2018 the Premier League and Raheem Sterling because of his so dynamic and so positive
[2480.80 - 2485.76] P:1558.50 E:0.065925 |  in those areas yeah that's the danger you know that's what you get you can play Sterling as the
[2485.76 - 2490.80] P:1425.08 E:0.067048 |  central man but out there on the left hand side there is that added threat Manet passing the ball
[2490.80 - 2495.76] P:1543.64 E:0.070408 |  beyond Alexander Arnold who does well to keep it in on that far side Alexander Arnold then back to
[2495.76 - 2501.76] P:1589.79 E:0.065433 |  Salah Salah low ball to Manet edge of the box back to Salah shoots takes a double deflection
[2501.76 - 2506.72] P:1592.64 E:0.069599 |  they're appealing for handball referee Oliver says no Jones to Robertson Robertson on the left
[2506.72 - 2511.12] P:1802.07 E:0.064440 |  hand side plays it across and a stretch and a clearance by Diaz. I tell you what John I tell
[2512.08 - 2518.64] P:1629.27 E:0.063828 |  this could be an ball. It's a close proximity which makes me think it might not be but the arm is
[2518.64 - 2524.88] P:1693.98 E:0.058224 |  outstretched I've only seen it here we've got a replay on our screen now as
[2526.56 - 2532.64] P:1522.55 E:0.060944 |  no that's no it's not a penalty what am I talking about I'm not even sure he was Rodgery it's him
[2532.64 - 2537.28] P:1550.13 E:0.068020 |  on the arm I think he might have been just outside the box as well actually so definitely wouldn't
[2538.16 - 2544.40] P:1487.56 E:0.065065 |  certainly wouldn't but they've had a look you know they always will and it remains nil nil Liverpool
[2544.40 - 2549.60] P:1501.73 E:0.065499 |  nil Manchester City nil. You've got to say all the Liverpool players appealed John didn't they in
[2549.60 - 2557.44] P:1410.13 E:0.061597 |  close proximity they did but Michael Oliver was quite decisive about that Salah playing the ball
[2557.44 - 2563.52] P:1344.18 E:0.059871 |  over the top headed away by Cancelo answers down for Manchester City and then it's played forward
[2563.52 - 2569.52] P:1598.29 E:0.070166 |  by Rodgery he has Foden turning playing it into Thiago it bounces favourably for City
[2569.52 - 2575.20] P:1474.07 E:0.071540 |  Gundawan now Zinchenko to Sterling who's got his heels on the white line over there on the far side
[2576.64 - 2584.16] P:1427.85 E:0.067514 |  comes back in field Cancelo in that central position very nearly lost out to Mani but was able
[2584.16 - 2591.44] P:1446.81 E:0.064833 |  to recover and it finds Márez on the right hand side remember Márez hitting the ball over the
[2591.44 - 2596.56] P:1483.61 E:0.069850 |  crossbar here at Anfield a couple of years ago right at the end of the game I'm not sure who
[2596.56 - 2604.08] P:1466.51 E:0.062999 |  missed it by most Márez or Gundawan today here's Foden Foden driving forward centrally but
[2604.08 - 2608.08] P:1525.43 E:0.062979 |  showed too much of the ball to Fabinho he was able to just clear it away from him
[2609.36 - 2615.68] P:1379.50 E:0.061991 |  Robertson passes the ball across his penalty area to Allyson and Allyson lifts it forward to
[2615.68 - 2621.76] P:1555.31 E:0.066159 |  Jones just well actually to keep that in Jones however Manchester City were all over him and
[2621.76 - 2626.88] P:1542.67 E:0.066973 |  win the ball back Gundawan playing it forward it's cleared away now he has Fomino through the middle
[2626.88 - 2632.16] P:1512.33 E:0.070835 |  Fomino lifts it via an angle to Mani who might have been caught right on the edge of the box by
[2632.16 - 2637.60] P:1779.59 E:0.066732 |  Cancelo referee Oliver says yes he was just waited to see if an advantage was going to develop there
[2637.60 - 2642.24] P:1644.96 E:0.066729 |  for Sario Mani but this was a couple of feet outside the penalty area and it's a free
[2645.68 - 2647.68] P:1588.87 E:0.055274 |  ball
[2655.20 - 2660.40] P:1640.79 E:0.062073 |  oh do you know what we've just lost the line to Anfield so you can hear the crowd in the background
[2660.96 - 2666.16] P:1541.54 E:0.063188 |  but no John Murray or Robbie Savage so we'll try and bring you that back we're obviously very very
[2666.16 - 2671.84] P:1597.04 E:0.060544 |  close to halftime anyway 8 5 0 5 8 at 5 live sport the way to get in touch just while we're waiting
[2671.84 - 2677.12] P:1586.19 E:0.060101 |  to get the commentary team back and Liverpool have a free kick we can rejoin them now I'm delighted
[2677.12 - 2682.96] P:1398.54 E:0.058526 |  to save for the free kick referee just talking to the players in the Manchester City wall
[2684.72 - 2695.12] P:1343.25 E:0.068372 |  and one of the city players is going to lie down behind the wall can't see who it is so we've got
[2695.12 - 2701.76] P:1488.15 E:0.066284 |  we've seen City do this before haven't we Robbie it's a wall of five and Zincenco has
[2702.80 - 2705.52] P:1121.36 E:0.063204 |  has lain down rather like
[2707.12 - 2712.40] P:1587.22 E:0.075432 |  do you remember that shot of William Reese Moe lying down in the house of Cummins on the on the front bench
[2713.92 - 2719.76] P:1527.17 E:0.066008 |  free kick then Tiago hits it via the top of the wall and then up and over the crossbar
[2719.76 - 2724.24] P:1426.91 E:0.066927 |  and behind for a goal kick judging judging by your expression you don't remember that
[2725.92 - 2730.72] P:1526.99 E:0.075051 |  well so you you know you watch the House of Cummins you watch weather reports wow
[2732.32 - 2736.64] P:1624.72 E:0.069528 |  just just curious Robbie that's all corner from the left hand side
[2737.20 - 2741.76] P:1513.26 E:0.071798 |  fall of a pool Alexander Arnold to take this one raises his left arm swings it into the
[2741.76 - 2745.84] P:1695.92 E:0.070760 |  edge of the six yard box headed down goalwards from Mane but it's straight at Edison who is able
[2745.84 - 2750.24] P:1593.38 E:0.071173 |  to move swiftly to his left and just grab the ball into his mid-riff and now Sterling plays it up
[2750.24 - 2755.44] P:1544.54 E:0.067022 |  through the middle Manchester City quick quickly off on the counter attack Foden comes across
[2755.44 - 2761.28] P:1209.80 E:0.069749 |  and then the ball bounces out of play on the far side two minutes of added time have been added on
[2761.28 - 2766.96] P:1396.29 E:0.069679 |  and it's a throwing to to Liverpool half inside their own heart do you know what John looking at you
[2766.96 - 2772.32] P:1381.98 E:0.073283 |  know looks like it's going to be nearly a half time and these things since Ruthen Diaz signed for
[2772.32 - 2777.68] P:1474.04 E:0.068308 |  Manchester City in September they've only conceived seven goals in the Premier League it is quite
[2777.68 - 2785.20] P:1363.00 E:0.061025 |  remarkable isn't it it is an astonishing change of fortune isn't it that that they've been able
[2785.20 - 2791.84] P:1440.07 E:0.066267 |  to do that and and stones and Diaz together they've started this is the 14th match they've started
[2791.84 - 2799.60] P:1437.79 E:0.059587 |  together and in those matches City have conceded one goal ball over the top four city gundoan on
[2799.60 - 2805.28] P:1541.53 E:0.059819 |  the chase but the ball bounced up high off the surface here and gundoan took it down and he was
[2805.28 - 2810.96] P:1567.80 E:0.065981 |  shepherded away by Alexander Arnold he has Sterling now on the left hand side Sterling back to Roderick
[2810.96 - 2816.24] P:1517.95 E:0.068303 |  calls the ball across the box but it's straight into the path of Jones in Liverpool look to break
[2816.24 - 2821.12] P:1619.28 E:0.071531 |  away here in added time at the end of the first half Manchester City having missed the penalty
[2821.12 - 2826.40] P:1672.35 E:0.064739 |  through gundoan so it's still now now five live in the world service Manet plays the ball to
[2826.40 - 2832.16] P:1552.57 E:0.064376 |  Salah on the right hand side Jones makes himself available so the good first half Curtis Jones
[2832.16 - 2840.16] P:1467.39 E:0.065991 |  Jones then with City players either side of him he loses it to Sterling and Manchester City clear
[2840.16 - 2847.28] P:1278.78 E:0.066844 |  towards the halfway line Allison the Liverpool goalkeeper relieved man when he saw the gundoan
[2847.28 - 2852.40] P:1590.54 E:0.066742 |  penalty fly over the top corner Liverpool play forward towards Robertson cancelo comes across
[2852.40 - 2858.80] P:1502.67 E:0.062269 |  and then was able to turn the ball under pressure out of play Liverpool take the throw quickly here's
[2858.80 - 2866.72] P:1417.60 E:0.067010 |  Tiago Tiago in the field towards Firmino he's dropped deep here Firmino finds Fabinho in the
[2866.72 - 2875.68] P:1380.53 E:0.064672 |  centre circle Wine Aldermas available as well so is Tiago and then Robertson takes the ball on the
[2875.68 - 2881.44] P:1571.84 E:0.063218 |  outside of his left boot flicks it into his own path Sadio Mane is going nowhere because that's
[2881.44 - 2886.80] P:1806.65 E:0.062487 |  the half-time whistle so the big talking point in the first half the fact that Manchester City
[2886.80 - 2894.56] P:1971.30 E:0.053125 |  missed a penalty in the 37th minute penalty won by Sterling challenged by Fabinho gundoan stepped
[2894.56 - 2900.88] P:1954.40 E:0.050243 |  up and he hit it over the top corner into the cop but other than that it's been tight Robby Savage
[2900.88 - 2907.20] P:1898.53 E:0.053609 |  Liverpool with the the header from Mane that was over the top Firmino's volley that was comfortably
[2907.20 - 2913.36] P:1788.80 E:0.055804 |  saved by Edison and Manchester City other than the penalty really creating very little very little
[2913.36 - 2918.16] P:1810.73 E:0.064441 |  indeed you know Liverpool now more possession in the game 54% they grew into the game and having
[2918.16 - 2923.36] P:1832.01 E:0.062206 |  their best spell without really creating chances and then Sterling's great run positivity getting to
[2923.36 - 2928.88] P:1472.18 E:0.056639 |  the box it was a penalty and then the big motin the game gundoan putting the ball in the in the
[2928.88 - 2938.56] P:1823.60 E:0.054340 |  cop so no no yeah half-time here at Anfield no goals Liverpool 0 Manchester City 0 well John the
[2938.56 - 2945.44] P:1866.53 E:0.063354 |  the old Jacob Rees mug reclining incident almost broke social media the penalty missed today has
[2945.44 - 2951.04] P:1944.19 E:0.063380 |  gone pretty close so many people getting in touch with it let's read a few of them Liz I just don't
[2951.12 - 2957.12] P:1898.77 E:0.061117 |  know how a German international can take a penalty like that we can't be doing that of all people
[2957.12 - 2962.88] P:1888.09 E:0.065683 |  not even on target London money says after that penalty England could do a lot worse than get
[2962.88 - 2969.60] P:1874.31 E:0.061047 |  gundoan in for the next six nations yes very good we have heard Daniel City terrible at penalties
[2969.60 - 2976.96] P:1899.76 E:0.061583 |  this is Guardiola's refusal to let Edison take them coward there have been loads Robbie on social
[2976.96 - 2981.76] P:1830.39 E:0.063241 |  media of people saying that pet said in the past he's the best penalty taker well the interesting
[2981.76 - 2989.92] P:1896.49 E:0.057170 |  start um Steve City have scored nine of the 17 penalties in the Premier League so it's quite
[2989.92 - 2996.56] P:1858.96 E:0.059097 |  remarkable really to think that you know it's a four-star 52.4% conversion rate that was very very
[2996.56 - 3001.28] P:1696.72 E:0.056249 |  quick yeah yeah didn't work rather that was good at schools huh well clearly maths especially
[3002.08 - 3009.36] P:1824.31 E:0.059690 |  very good at MPE believe it or not um so yeah um yeah Edison yeah it's a good point you know
[3010.48 - 3016.48] P:1960.72 E:0.055318 |  one day yeah one day hopefully one day you were also as John alluded to very early in the game
[3016.48 - 3020.56] P:1851.38 E:0.063109 |  good at avoiding the second yellow card now I'm not saying the game today took a bit of time to
[3020.56 - 3025.04] P:1798.84 E:0.064178 |  get going but I did spend 20 minutes doing some research on your career all right Robbie so
[3025.04 - 3035.60] P:1763.29 E:0.059599 |  you got 145 yellow cards in your career did I you did only once did you get a second yellow and I
[3035.60 - 3040.64] P:1987.19 E:0.066844 |  watched the video it was never a second yellow it was a disgraceful decision I'm Chris Foy so
[3041.68 - 3046.72] P:2018.97 E:0.060146 |  so the question is based on Tiago being in the engine room sitting on a yellow card how do you
[3046.72 - 3050.72] P:1936.34 E:0.061341 |  do it when you're in a position of that importance how do you avoid the second yellow and still have
[3050.72 - 3055.60] P:1868.43 E:0.056841 |  a big impact on the game you know it's very difficult you know um I was going to say in a big game
[3055.60 - 3062.16] P:1938.91 E:0.061553 |  but I never played that many um you look at Jeff Hendrick yesterday Steve don't you he'd been booked
[3062.16 - 3067.36] P:1916.72 E:0.059973 |  early and then he pulled the shirt that for me is stupidity you know I was never in a position where
[3067.36 - 3073.92] P:1959.82 E:0.061004 |  you'd give a a silly second yellow and that was silly isn't if you if you're in the in the last
[3073.92 - 3079.68] P:1966.56 E:0.058565 |  five minutes you defendly you're throwing yourself in blocks and challenges then okay you might get
[3079.76 - 3084.88] P:1988.18 E:0.058222 |  one but what I tend to do is that mentality of do you know what don't do anything stupid you know
[3084.88 - 3090.88] P:1930.02 E:0.061912 |  like the pull of the shirt or things like that I never changed the way I played um Steve I always
[3090.88 - 3096.00] P:1913.94 E:0.055314 |  went in for challenges and I got away with a lot to be fair I should have had more but I just think
[3096.00 - 3101.92] P:2069.55 E:0.062144 |  I was clever and clever and Robbie Savage don't usually go together as John's alluded to several
[3101.92 - 3106.88] P:1937.87 E:0.057087 |  times since I've been working with him no no don't do yourself down be clever I think that's a good
[3106.96 - 3111.84] P:1904.04 E:0.063118 |  message for for Tiago in the second half didn't look very clever Ilkai Gundawan's penalty did it
[3111.84 - 3117.36] P:2013.86 E:0.057228 |  way over the bar and that is why at halftime at Anfield it's Liverpool nil Manchester City nil
[3117.36 - 3122.24] P:1960.49 E:0.061910 |  we'll look ahead to the Super Bowl we'll get more reaction to today's other games in the Premier League

[3331.36 - 3337.04] P:1798.43 E:0.052148 |  there's always a game where he produces for us and that's why he's one of the top goalkeepers at

[3342.00 - 3345.76] P:1848.15 E:0.054976 |  Yeah we just see the threat the minute he's on the pitch how you can stretch the game and
[3346.72 - 3351.44] P:1517.52 E:0.062579 |  gives that energy to the team so yeah and I'll great to have him in the in the game and back

[3380.16 - 3386.56] P:1970.06 E:0.053496 |  anxious like I have to play the game the intensity is real coming from me. This is not your first
[3386.56 - 3392.40] P:2000.20 E:0.054933 |  rodeo so anybody listening to this who's like right I am staying up for the Super Bowl what do
[3392.48 - 3398.16] P:1853.63 E:0.049773 |  you have to do to make sure you get through? Well first of all it has to be an entertaining game
[3398.16 - 3403.44] P:1781.94 E:0.066897 |  and we're going to have that because we have the legend Tom Brady against the new legend
[3403.44 - 3408.40] P:1742.34 E:0.062630 |  Patrick Mahomes they're going to be dueling it out and then if you're listening to us we will
[3408.40 - 3414.88] P:1935.10 E:0.063161 |  keep you engaged entertain educated and you got to have a beverage to keep yourself going and some
[3414.88 - 3421.68] P:1974.58 E:0.047621 |  snacks that is the key to a Super Bowl. You know I guess because because the quarterbacks of the
[3421.76 - 3426.96] P:2180.61 E:0.057174 |  story without wishing to jinx it if you know the two QBs are going to be the people everyone is
[3426.96 - 3432.48] P:1892.29 E:0.051950 |  talking about that lends itself to an exciting high scoring game doesn't it? Yeah without a doubt
[3432.48 - 3437.76] P:1688.64 E:0.060882 |  and both these offenses can score points in a hurry. Patrick Mahomes and Kansas City have been the
[3437.76 - 3444.24] P:1786.60 E:0.070026 |  best offense all year and we know what Tom Brady can do with any team and he is loaded with this
[3444.24 - 3450.72] P:1744.03 E:0.061729 |  Buccaneers roster so at any moment they can come on he is the comeback kid so you're just ready for
[3450.72 - 3456.00] P:1941.97 E:0.049992 |  points everywhere to be scored. Does this kind of feel like a bit of a changing of the guard between
[3456.00 - 3462.32] P:1724.03 E:0.049556 |  Brady and Mahomes? Yeah without a doubt that's why this game is so important for Mahomes because
[3462.32 - 3468.64] P:1848.52 E:0.063143 |  if he has any ability to catch up to Tom Brady he's going to have to beat him in a head-on-head
[3468.64 - 3473.36] P:1702.97 E:0.064199 |  matchup they have he has to beat him if he wants to catch him and be the greatest of all time.
[3473.44 - 3480.72] P:2054.31 E:0.045113 |  18 years between the two of them is there anything is there anything that Mahomes is kind of the
[3480.72 - 3486.56] P:1973.57 E:0.057187 |  the sort of pretender to the throne is there anything he can do that Brady can't at this stage in his career?
[3487.28 - 3494.56] P:1686.17 E:0.062937 |  Oh movement the way Patrick Mahomes moves he can throw the ball any direction off of any platform
[3494.56 - 3501.04] P:1840.65 E:0.063324 |  and Brady can't do that Brady has to be in the pocket protected his footwork has to be the same
[3501.12 - 3506.96] P:1637.58 E:0.060374 |  very repetitive that's the way he plays that's the way he's always played but Patrick Mahomes is
[3506.96 - 3511.84] P:1811.53 E:0.068454 |  just so creative and athletic when he throws the ball he's something we've never seen.
[3512.72 - 3516.40] P:2060.99 E:0.054109 |  Right I've got to make notes here Jason because I will obviously be staying up to listen you
[3516.40 - 3523.12] P:1862.28 E:0.051478 |  mentioned snacks what shall I be getting in? I mean whatever you it's all up to you that's the beauty
[3523.12 - 3529.04] P:1913.12 E:0.060352 |  of the Super Bowl whatever you're into it's okay it's all accepted. All right and what will you be
[3529.04 - 3535.60] P:1722.90 E:0.056012 |  eating then? Oh I'm doing the broadcast man it's water it's protein bars it's everything I'm an
[3535.60 - 3541.36] P:1850.96 E:0.058035 |  athlete I got to keep it together man nothing too crazy. I am not so crisps and beer I think.
[3542.40 - 3549.60] P:1958.18 E:0.046840 |  I like that. Jason thanks very much and enjoy the show. Appreciate it. I can't wait 11 p.m. tonight
[3549.60 - 3555.28] P:2057.39 E:0.056178 |  it's going to be brilliant the Super Bowl live on five live and with Mahomes and Brady and that
[3555.36 - 3559.76] P:2021.01 E:0.055252 |  story it's all set up for a bit of a Hollywood ending I'm sure and in fact speaking of Hollywood
[3559.76 - 3564.56] P:2170.61 E:0.056892 |  Golden Globes nominations were earlier this week there was that huge controversy this is totally
[3564.56 - 3569.76] P:2060.53 E:0.052000 |  away from football I may destroy you by Michaela Cole which is brilliant didn't get a nomination
[3570.32 - 3574.96] P:1970.34 E:0.057399 |  Emily in Paris did get a nomination one of the writers on that show Deborah Coe-Pacon said that
[3574.96 - 3580.72] P:1971.75 E:0.053358 |  she was devastated by that even though her own program has been recognized the reason I'm mentioning
[3580.72 - 3585.52] P:2033.81 E:0.051667 |  this is because she is fascinating she's had a great career she was a war photographer in Afghanistan
[3585.52 - 3592.40] P:2076.81 E:0.054730 |  she is going to be on five live tomorrow on Nihal's show with Jeff Lloyd from 1 p.m. Deborah Coe-Pacon
[3592.40 - 3598.00] P:1965.76 E:0.051081 |  that is definitely something to put in your diary. I think even the best scripted drama would be
[3598.00 - 3602.16] P:1904.06 E:0.057073 |  challenged though by the story we've had at the Principality Stadium today. Wales coming from behind
[3602.16 - 3609.04] P:2060.01 E:0.053784 |  to beat Ireland 21-16 Ireland's Peter Omani was sent off after just 14 minutes despite that they
[3609.12 - 3614.48] P:2071.59 E:0.056973 |  ended up leading the game only to be pegged back George North and Louis Rhys Zammitt scoring tries
[3614.48 - 3619.52] P:2043.07 E:0.049018 |  for Wales ending a run of four straight six nations defeats let's hear from their captain
[3619.52 - 3623.76] P:1764.02 E:0.053856 |  Alan Wynne Jones with Sonja McLaughlin. It was a bit of a pressure on Wales wasn't there
[3623.76 - 3629.60] P:1667.41 E:0.062466 |  how important is it to have started this championship with with the W? I think if you're
[3629.60 - 3634.00] P:1579.83 E:0.065724 |  fortunate enough to pull this on there's always pressure I know what you're saying there's particular
[3634.00 - 3638.24] P:1742.84 E:0.061655 |  pressure obviously after the autumn we had but when I went shy away from that I think
[3638.24 - 3641.68] P:1704.29 E:0.060281 |  the game today probably told the story what happens when you come under a pressure but the
[3641.68 - 3646.56] P:1627.52 E:0.055649 |  positive pressure of having been a man to the good if you like but you know we came through
[3646.56 - 3652.08] P:1430.67 E:0.065821 |  thankfully. You did Ireland went a man down and then they hit you with 13 unanswered points was
[3652.08 - 3656.08] P:1790.71 E:0.065197 |  patience the message? Yeah very much so I think you know that can sometimes galvanise a team and
[3656.08 - 3659.44] P:1533.96 E:0.065494 |  credit to Ireland you know we knew what they were we're going to bring and like I said that probably
[3659.44 - 3663.84] P:1331.79 E:0.057892 |  galvanised them in the middle part of the game. Yeah tries a little bit hard to come by for Wales
[3663.84 - 3669.44] P:1495.98 E:0.067951 |  in the autumn how pleasing to say George North and Louis Samet go over. Yeah I think obviously
[3669.44 - 3674.40] P:1565.81 E:0.062108 |  George was the opportune one I think and we're happy with the constructive Zamos one we'd like
[3674.40 - 3678.88] P:1565.73 E:0.059493 |  to think we probably could finish more off with our possession that we have but we've got a foot in
[3678.88 - 3684.24] P:1638.26 E:0.045944 |  the door at the start of the competition. That's Alan Wynne Jones we're going to go back to Anfield
[3684.24 - 3688.88] P:1661.75 E:0.057843 |  then second half commentary to come of Liverpool Manchester City nil nil thanks to that penalty
[3688.88 - 3692.88] P:1790.87 E:0.059279 |  miss from Ilkai Gunduan just reading some more of the messages you've been sending in
[3693.60 - 3700.08] P:1796.81 E:0.062170 |  Mick Márez de Bruyne now Gunduan three wretched penalties against Liverpool this is such a bizarre
[3700.08 - 3705.28] P:1652.91 E:0.060360 |  curse Sam Quex been on social media good job there are no fans in the cop that penalty could have
[3705.28 - 3710.32] P:1808.69 E:0.063740 |  hurt someone our own Phil McNulty says if City get another then they should let Edison take it
[3710.32 - 3715.60] P:1794.15 E:0.061931 |  he's not the only one saying that your commentary team John Murray and Robbie Savage. Robbie in
[3715.60 - 3722.32] P:1847.76 E:0.062338 |  Gunduan we're talking about a guy who scored a penalty at 22 in a Champions League final against
[3722.32 - 3728.64] P:1772.41 E:0.057748 |  Manuel Neuer so if you're in a team with a guy like that and he misses a penalty can that have
[3728.64 - 3734.08] P:1592.59 E:0.053905 |  quite a big psychological impact on you? No I don't think so I think you know his performance
[3734.08 - 3739.36] P:1710.51 E:0.060654 |  after has been good getting on the ball not hired he's missed a penalty listen the best players
[3739.36 - 3743.12] P:1677.32 E:0.060610 |  in the world miss penalties just one of those things I think he's missed a few now isn't he?
[3743.12 - 3747.60] P:1577.93 E:0.062821 |  No that's the second one he's missed yeah he's only missed one before yeah he's missed two yeah
[3747.60 - 3752.08] P:1780.49 E:0.065559 |  so they won't affect him at all I don't think Steve but listen thanks for your stats I didn't
[3752.08 - 3757.92] P:1682.10 E:0.067817 |  know that you know that's 145 yeah I thought it was 89 the Premier I didn't know the total was 145
[3758.48 - 3763.44] P:1668.19 E:0.055698 |  wow good stat Steve that's all right thanks for that I told you I'm here for you and also here
[3763.44 - 3767.36] P:1961.85 E:0.057353 |  for you a Robbie Savage and John Murray with a second half at Hanfield thank you Steve the
[3767.36 - 3773.68] P:1981.55 E:0.063785 |  city players are out they're not making any changes Liverpool's players just emerging from the wide
[3773.68 - 3781.44] P:1927.96 E:0.052035 |  tunnel down below with the Liverpool slogans written all in white on the red background
[3782.08 - 3788.24] P:1957.79 E:0.059968 |  and they also will be unchanged at the start of the second half so Liverpool with Alison and Gull
[3788.80 - 3796.88] P:1875.94 E:0.047191 |  a back four of Alexander Arnold Fabinho Henderson and Robertson in midfield Jones Tiago Wine-Aldon
[3796.88 - 3804.16] P:1778.23 E:0.051136 |  and then the front line of Salah Firmino and Manet and the Manchester City side Edison in Gull
[3804.16 - 3811.28] P:1639.07 E:0.057235 |  Cancelo Stones Diaz and Zinchenko in midfield Rodry with Bernardo Silva and Gundawan and then
[3811.28 - 3818.40] P:1699.63 E:0.060365 |  Márez on the right sterling on the left and Phil Forden playing as the the false nine in this
[3818.40 - 3825.84] P:1475.82 E:0.061550 |  match but City even though there's been plenty of intent have created relatively little well and
[3825.84 - 3832.40] P:1581.94 E:0.064764 |  you say that John that was City's the penalty was the only shot they had inside Liverpool's 18 yard
[3832.40 - 3841.04] P:1396.25 E:0.059188 |  box in the whole half Liverpool didn't create much more at the other end Manet with his header over
[3841.04 - 3850.16] P:1409.87 E:0.062181 |  and Firmino's volley that was saved and it is Liverpool with the ball at the back that is fired
[3850.16 - 3857.44] P:1564.97 E:0.068342 |  up to Firmino in the halfway line but City sky blue shirts white shorts sky blue socks against
[3857.44 - 3861.68] P:1621.46 E:0.068398 |  Liverpool and their first choice kit they all read with the white trim Manet playing it into the
[3861.68 - 3867.20] P:1683.25 E:0.070982 |  penalty area Salah with a make making a run across the box but Zinchenko went with him very well
[3867.20 - 3871.84] P:1529.28 E:0.066424 |  and cleared it right for it both teams have defended ever so well John haven't they yeah there's
[3871.84 - 3878.48] P:1416.65 E:0.061631 |  one mistake that's led to the penalty from Firmino but other than that both defences are coming out
[3878.48 - 3884.80] P:1566.08 E:0.062667 |  on top well that's the the secret to Manchester City's success this season all of these clean sheets
[3884.80 - 3894.16] P:1337.75 E:0.059978 |  had six in a roll in the Premier League and City with the main men now in central defence Stones
[3894.16 - 3900.00] P:1598.68 E:0.067641 |  and Diaz together quite a partnership that they've put together in Maricola Port who was missed so
[3900.00 - 3905.20] P:1535.01 E:0.069200 |  much last season very much second string at the moment he's on the bench from Manchester City as
[3905.20 - 3910.40] P:1727.63 E:0.069487 |  is Gabriel Jezus I suspect we will see Gabriel Jezus at some stage in the second half Tiago
[3910.40 - 3915.76] P:1488.79 E:0.066978 |  playing it out to the left hand side and Curtis Jones is out there Jones plays it back to Wine
[3915.76 - 3920.32] P:1662.51 E:0.070606 |  Alden Wine Alden is Liverpool attacked towards the cop in the second half Tiago tried to slip it
[3920.32 - 3924.96] P:1520.92 E:0.075652 |  through on the edge of the box but hit it straight the cancel fireworks being set off from

[3964.48 - 3969.28] P:1679.91 E:0.074622 |  steps away from Bernardo Silva then gives it out to Alexander-Arnold early cross from Alexander-Arnold
[3969.28 - 3973.20] P:1590.50 E:0.068386 |  that's been a bit of a feature actually when he's had the opportunity the early ball in the box

[4023.52 - 4030.80] P:1401.33 E:0.059723 |  other than you know City not getting beat here you would suggest that the massive
[4030.80 - 4037.04] P:1377.89 E:0.063296 |  favour is to win the Premier League once again. Foden slips as he plays the ball out towards
[4037.04 - 4040.64] P:1718.47 E:0.072509 |  Sterling but it bounced back to him now Sterling is around Alexander-Arnold plays it across Foden

[4060.96 - 4066.08] P:1491.74 E:0.068592 |  at halftime how will it affect the players in the side how will it affect Gungawan by
[4066.08 - 4072.24] P:1554.39 E:0.064907 |  smashing that penalty into the court there's the answer great reaction from Man City's wonderful
[4072.24 - 4080.48] P:1648.10 E:0.061983 |  play once again from Raheem Sterling the way glided past players and then Foden the little 1-2
[4081.04 - 4087.52] P:1625.06 E:0.068339 |  but I've got to say Trent Alexander-Arnold one-on-one there poor poor play and then Foden
[4087.52 - 4092.96] P:1581.88 E:0.069192 |  a shot low down to Allisons left it's a good save but then Gungawan was quick to react
[4092.96 - 4100.32] P:1539.93 E:0.064040 |  Roberson couldn't get there four yards out smashes it into the net brilliant from Man City but I've
[4100.40 - 4105.84] P:1533.10 E:0.067362 |  got to say John the one-on-one situation there from Trent we're sterling defensively poor from
[4105.84 - 4115.04] P:1576.77 E:0.063461 |  Trent Alexander-Arnold Sterling just dance past him so easily and Foden very nearly scored himself
[4115.04 - 4120.08] P:1679.52 E:0.069828 |  that was a really sharp save by Allisons down to his left from from only a few yards away from
[4120.08 - 4125.36] P:1605.52 E:0.069228 |  Foden but he could only push it out into the six yard box and Gungawan was there to score his
[4125.36 - 4131.44] P:1496.66 E:0.067407 |  10th goal of the season for Manchester City in all competitions and Manchester City are exactly
[4131.44 - 4138.08] P:1482.56 E:0.070782 |  where Pep Guardiola wants them to be here at Anfield Guardiola who's never won as a manager at Anfield
[4138.08 - 4144.48] P:1523.93 E:0.071212 |  but seeing his team winning 1-0 now at a ground where Manchester City have not won since 2003
[4145.36 - 4153.04] P:1454.75 E:0.063400 |  and with this scoreline Liverpool 0 Manchester City 1 if it stays like this City's grip on this
[4153.04 - 4160.00] P:1621.59 E:0.065224 |  title race will be extremely tight. It'll be over John no one's going to catch Manchester City
[4160.00 - 4166.00] P:1447.55 E:0.067281 |  no they just don't concede goals you know they they they can win games by playing beautiful football
[4166.00 - 4173.44] P:1697.49 E:0.065630 |  they can win games the hard way just a fantastic football inside ah when Liverpool have all their
[4173.44 - 4178.48] P:1537.37 E:0.059951 |  players fit to John as well they are and they're a match for Man City you know the champions but
[4179.28 - 4182.88] P:1569.16 E:0.071380 |  you know because of their injuries because of key players out in people argue Kevin de Bruyne
[4182.88 - 4188.48] P:1591.26 E:0.067250 |  and Aguero. They'd be right to do that he has Foden on the left hand side swings in because
[4188.48 - 4195.92] P:1460.09 E:0.063740 |  Sterling in the middle couldn't get there and it very nearly reached Márez but Liverpool would
[4195.92 - 4202.96] P:1542.05 E:0.066690 |  just able to clear it through Robertson so close to Sterling who would have been all on his own
[4203.44 - 4210.08] P:1433.77 E:0.062072 |  in the middle eight yards out and that could easily have been 2-0 Jürgen Klopp stands hands behind

[4218.80 - 4224.48] P:1369.82 E:0.071827 |  what's happened now no matter now that penalty miss at the end of the first half from Ilkai Kundoan
[4225.04 - 4231.52] P:1412.95 E:0.068290 |  because he was there to slide in and score and give Manchester City the lead and now Liverpool
[4231.52 - 4237.12] P:1655.44 E:0.065945 |  the onus is on them and remember Liverpool have failed to score in their last three matches
[4237.12 - 4242.56] P:1374.60 E:0.064836 |  here at Anfield they've got to break that sequence if they're going to get anything out of this
[4242.56 - 4247.44] P:1371.48 E:0.068177 |  against the current Premier League leaders and that will be a Premier League their record you know

[4260.88 - 4267.44] P:1494.54 E:0.061615 |  as City played up towards Foden on the halfway line Sterling wants it over here but Foden goes
[4267.44 - 4274.24] P:1453.57 E:0.062642 |  short to Cancelor and then back into his own half yeah until this run Liverpool were almost
[4274.24 - 4282.72] P:1620.57 E:0.066863 |  unbeatable here was a 68 game 68 home Premier League matches without defeat they scored in 42

[4492.72 - 4496.32] P:1616.32 E:0.073319 |  he's got Liverpool and then either side of him but he works it away just flicks it away
[4496.32 - 4501.76] P:1470.76 E:0.064906 |  and he finds a teammate in sky blue and then Bernardo Silver is bundled over on the far side

[4541.84 - 4549.92] P:1618.30 E:0.065203 |  a time he'll be in advanced or Phil Fordon do you think he's blossomed because there's no David
[4549.92 - 4555.28] P:1485.48 E:0.065076 |  Silver you can think about that because Alexander Arnold plays it off well John's has done well ridden
[4555.28 - 4561.68] P:1757.50 E:0.064823 |  the challenge shoots a cross goal and just wider the foot of the far post fire a little
[4561.68 - 4566.88] P:1737.99 E:0.066174 |  deflection as well I tell you what I thought John Stones and ever so well they just stuck his foot
[4566.88 - 4574.08] P:1546.46 E:0.059972 |  out and I took it past the post but Curtis Jones he's played well for Liverpool this afternoon
[4574.08 - 4580.00] P:1601.82 E:0.061743 |  good play curls in I think it's the touch from Stones which takes it past the post corner then

[4591.44 - 4597.60] P:1469.33 E:0.066816 |  second one away from Alexander Arnold and Liverpool are making no impression with the set pieces such

[4644.72 - 4651.68] P:1460.90 E:0.064901 |  on 606 ball played in field by Liverpool here's Jones again holding off Rodry just outside the
[4651.68 - 4657.84] P:1550.10 E:0.070006 |  D uses Thiago Thiago stabs it forward Firmino in the D tries to work it back slightly behind Jones
[4658.56 - 4664.72] P:1440.83 E:0.060907 |  but Manchester City they defended so well they know their jobs so well that this is going to be
[4664.72 - 4669.04] P:1523.28 E:0.074611 |  a real challenge for Liverpool to find a way through Paul played by Jones for Mani but it was too
[4669.04 - 4673.44] P:1471.39 E:0.074467 |  far ahead of him Kundoan was back in there the goal scorer and Manchester City played away
[4673.44 - 4678.08] P:1513.19 E:0.065041 |  Sterling Firmino got there first Alexander-Arnold just beat him to it Liverpool have to start again
[4678.08 - 4682.64] P:1466.06 E:0.068980 |  from inside their own half Liverpool trying to build ahead of steam Robbie yeah they are but so
[4682.64 - 4690.00] P:1571.42 E:0.063208 |  compact you know city defending the width of the 18-yard box no space between the lines good shape
[4690.56 - 4696.80] P:1388.33 E:0.068503 |  Mani loses out to Bernardo Silva Henderson in on the challenge then it's played forward by
[4696.80 - 4702.48] P:1571.68 E:0.068201 |  Márez Bernardo Silva Liverpool are stretched here Forden's available in the middle but it goes back
[4702.48 - 4707.76] P:1500.97 E:0.066073 |  towards the centre circle to Kundoan who turns and shapes his body as he passes it to Sterling
[4707.76 - 4712.48] P:1499.39 E:0.069200 |  Sterling's up against Alexander-Arnold again but Mani is back to help him out this time so
[4712.48 - 4717.60] P:1442.54 E:0.066806 |  on this occasion Sterling doesn't go running at Alexander-Arnold in Manchester City with the
[4717.60 - 4723.44] P:1468.63 E:0.066500 |  lead that they have or can tend to go back towards the halfway line ideal scenario this for
[4723.44 - 4729.12] P:1344.87 E:0.064456 |  Manchester City coming here with the lead that they've got the the two-point lead at the top of
[4729.12 - 4734.40] P:1506.91 E:0.065948 |  the table with two matches in hand against Manchester United the seven-point lead that
[4734.40 - 4740.96] P:1585.27 E:0.064409 |  they've currently got over Liverpool to be one meal up is is absolutely they've got Liverpool
[4740.96 - 4747.20] P:1480.88 E:0.060233 |  where they want them now Márez Márez running at Robertson checks back ball bounces away but it
[4747.20 - 4751.84] P:1282.12 E:0.065737 |  bounces back to Manchester City Cancellors there and he will play it back towards the halfway
[4751.84 - 4756.96] P:1552.78 E:0.066287 |  line and suddenly after that spell of Liverpool pressure Manchester City have responded and
[4756.96 - 4764.00] P:1462.19 E:0.064877 |  now Liverpool can't get the ball off the Premier League leaders Zinchenko the fairhead Ukrainian
[4764.56 - 4769.92] P:1543.23 E:0.067910 |  he's listening on breakfast this morning they had a Ukrainian Liverpool fan on who was talking

[4794.32 - 4800.40] P:1524.55 E:0.069121 |  one nil you know City dominating the game without creating that much you know but you go back to
[4800.40 - 4805.68] P:1622.27 E:0.066622 |  the goal the way Sterling went past Alexander Arnault we seen the penalty as well yes it was
[4805.68 - 4811.92] P:1470.73 E:0.062492 |  Fabinho who brought Sterling down but the way on that occasion Alexander Arnault was great pass from
[4812.72 - 4818.16] P:1629.05 E:0.075544 |  Neely from oh Diaz has given it straight to Salah and then the recovering challenge he's found him
[4818.16 - 4824.48] P:1548.49 E:0.067436 |  it's a penalty to Liverpool now in front of the Cop Diaz the ball bounced off him it's a yellow card
[4824.48 - 4830.00] P:1661.53 E:0.066261 |  for the Manchester City defender he attempted to clear it after Alexander Arnault's long ball
[4830.00 - 4835.28] P:1633.98 E:0.061498 |  forward for Salah he cleared it straight into Salah it bounced back past him and he just bundled him
[4835.28 - 4840.08] P:1656.54 E:0.068605 |  over inside the penalty area as Salah was looking to go through so only a yellow card for Diaz
[4841.28 - 4852.32] P:1515.72 E:0.064006 |  oh tell you what Salah has got the ball he drives into the box Diaz grabs oh grabs his arm
[4852.32 - 4860.96] P:1468.78 E:0.060711 |  listen more Salah has certainly made the most of it he's thrown himself down but there was
[4860.96 - 4868.32] P:1538.64 E:0.064114 |  contact he grabbed his arm it's a penalty VA I've had a look at it Michael Oliver was certain so
[4868.88 - 4875.44] P:1634.88 E:0.063519 |  chance for Liverpool to equalise more Salah who scored all six of his penalties this season in
[4875.44 - 4879.44] P:1507.02 E:0.066433 |  front of the Cop this is where Gundawan missed in the first half Salah sets out to the right
[4879.44 - 4885.12] P:1605.82 E:0.072295 |  left footed high into the net it's a goal it's an equaliser for Liverpool it's one one here
[4885.12 - 4890.88] P:1418.20 E:0.069031 |  between the champions and the Premier League leaders now the same corner Gundawan went for
[4890.88 - 4897.76] P:1501.98 E:0.063177 |  put it over no mistake from Salah wonderful penalty great desire from Salah wasn't it John
[4897.76 - 4907.52] P:1476.45 E:0.061214 |  a mistake from Diaz yes he pulled Salah's arm is was there enough for Salah to go down listen I
[4907.60 - 4913.20] P:1439.84 E:0.065234 |  did the same thing if I was Salah and he puts the penalty away ever so well one one
[4915.92 - 4922.96] P:1541.17 E:0.068820 |  Salah Mohammed Salah scoring his 22nd goal of the season his 16th in the Premier League the Premier
[4922.96 - 4927.68] P:1707.45 E:0.070565 |  League's leading scorer this season but Sterling's off on a run Sterling still going trying to find
[4927.68 - 4932.40] P:1611.66 E:0.063930 |  Mahrez but the pass from Sterling was just a little short and so Robertson was able to
[4932.56 - 4939.36] P:1442.26 E:0.064609 |  move across and clear it away downfield well that's that's a lifeline for Liverpool there wasn't
[4939.36 - 4946.08] P:1592.16 E:0.065537 |  any great prospect was there of Liverpool fighting their way back into the game but that that slip
[4946.08 - 4953.44] P:1405.87 E:0.064774 |  that characteristic slip from Diaz passing the ball clearing it straight into sat he was a little
[4953.44 - 4959.28] P:1593.55 E:0.064412 |  unfortunate was there enough was there enough pressure from Diaz on Salah's arm John for Salah
[4959.52 - 4964.88] P:1422.20 E:0.061687 |  to go down that's the question I'm asking you he grew up he grew well no there wasn't
[4964.88 - 4971.12] P:1471.37 E:0.061453 |  no that's the answer to the question for him to go down in that manner no there wasn't but Diaz
[4971.12 - 4977.12] P:1392.93 E:0.063462 |  grabbed his arm in the penalty area was Salah feature in the simulation game do you think
[4978.40 - 4982.40] P:1511.85 E:0.070493 |  not for the first time Mahrez crossing from the right hand side
[4983.12 - 4988.56] P:1402.45 E:0.068185 |  but Alexander-Arnold was able to get up in between Foden and Gündewan and headed away
[4989.36 - 4994.56] P:1470.80 E:0.067357 |  Pep Guardiola very warmly wrapped up Pep Guardiola was not really seen much of him have we on the
[4994.56 - 5000.96] P:1459.31 E:0.064682 |  edge of the coaching area he's got one of those big scarves of his own very wise he has Mane
[5000.96 - 5005.12] P:1278.36 E:0.067906 |  Mane turns gives the ball out towards the left hand side but Robertson Robertson cross straight
[5005.12 - 5011.12] P:1305.42 E:0.059884 |  into the council all stays in play Robertson plays it back towards the halfway line
[5011.84 - 5019.12] P:1435.34 E:0.061121 |  Liverpool won Manchester City won just as it was at the Etihad when they met in November
[5019.68 - 5024.48] P:1395.78 E:0.060110 |  and there was a miss penalty in that game John wasn't it Kevin De Bruyne it that's correct
[5024.48 - 5029.12] P:1603.10 E:0.065824 |  ball played over the top Canslow is able to to head it away he's backed away
[5030.00 - 5036.56] P:1520.37 E:0.071247 |  what drinks slips as he gives it to Gündewan neither manager flop no Guardiola I was going to say
[5036.56 - 5041.44] P:1601.62 E:0.063064 |  has made a change yet but as I look down there it's Shaqiri who's being prepared to come on for
[5041.44 - 5046.96] P:1484.12 E:0.067165 |  Liverpool that's going to be the first substitution for either team I was wondering who it might be
[5048.56 - 5054.40] P:1653.54 E:0.073534 |  so presumably one of the three or is Jurgen Klopp feeling that he's got to go for this
[5054.40 - 5060.00] P:1461.83 E:0.067122 |  here is Mahrez on the right hand side Mahrez back to it Canslow centrally Canslow works it
[5060.00 - 5064.32] P:1695.07 E:0.064566 |  across to the left hand side Sterling gets it down Alexander-Arnold goes very tight on him
[5064.32 - 5068.16] P:1492.77 E:0.060810 |  and then he gets support from Thiago just puts a foot in and takes it away from him
[5068.16 - 5074.40] P:1432.89 E:0.065073 |  but City are still in possession this is this is very very interesting now how long have we got
[5074.40 - 5082.56] P:1462.59 E:0.063792 |  left 25 minutes to play 1-1 the champions really need to win it if they can City of course want
[5082.56 - 5089.92] P:1443.57 E:0.061428 |  to win it if they get a point that's absolutely fine he has Bernardo Silva Bernardo Silva to the
[5089.92 - 5095.76] P:1395.83 E:0.064326 |  right to cancel it left-footed ball is heading away on the edge of the box by the Liverpool captain
[5097.04 - 5102.72] P:1365.26 E:0.072190 |  Henderson next to his England colleague Foden Salah goes down very easily in the center circle
[5102.72 - 5107.04] P:1497.01 E:0.067093 |  doesn't win a free kick this time from referee Oliver Sterling it's beaten challenged
[5107.04 - 5112.72] P:1563.84 E:0.069308 |  that's a fine Alexander-Arnold Alexander-Arnold down a long pass well that's easily headed
[5113.28 - 5120.64] P:1606.40 E:0.061463 |  by Stones and Rodry is there to to tidy it up so that the goal that Liverpool have scored
[5120.64 - 5126.24] P:1371.24 E:0.064125 |  only the second goal that Manchester City have conceded when Stones and Diaz have started together
[5126.24 - 5131.20] P:1484.62 E:0.069387 |  from Manchester City and that one obviously coming from the penalty spot the change is going to be
[5131.20 - 5136.48] P:1531.65 E:0.063459 |  Thiago yeah the Jurgen Klopp feeling that he's got to go for this taking off one of them it fielded
[5136.72 - 5144.96] P:1418.65 E:0.068715 |  and it's a double change Milner's coming on as well so Thiago is replaced by Shaqiri
[5146.16 - 5152.32] P:1376.27 E:0.064731 |  and James Milner Premier League winner with Manchester City a couple of times he was there
[5152.32 - 5158.80] P:1425.86 E:0.061883 |  he was on the bench on that famous day against Queen's Park Rangers back in 2012 and it's
[5158.80 - 5166.48] P:1318.65 E:0.062504 |  going to be is it Curtis Jones that's coming yeah I'm surprised they don't yeah I think he's
[5166.48 - 5170.08] P:1549.21 E:0.073969 |  playing well Curtis Jones you know Milner's surprised when he came off was it against
[5171.28 - 5176.08] P:1498.63 E:0.075387 |  West Ham when Curtis Jones come on and Klopp and Milner the laugh on the sideline now now he's
[5176.08 - 5180.40] P:1583.36 E:0.067551 |  through the way around can Milner have a big impact on the game like Curtis Jones did when he
[5180.40 - 5187.52] P:1397.39 E:0.060956 |  come on in that game and how are Liverpool going to play this with Shaqiri Manne Fomino and Salah
[5187.52 - 5198.48] P:1291.68 E:0.063874 |  on Shaqiri the start had offers the right-sided midfield city coming forward no Thiago now in
[5198.48 - 5202.80] P:1627.79 E:0.071082 |  the field Sterling to his where gets away from Alexander on crosses across the penalty area
[5203.36 - 5208.40] P:1643.47 E:0.066893 |  Foden went down then the shot from Bernardo Silver on the edge of the D but he sliced it well wide
[5208.40 - 5214.96] P:1462.17 E:0.057150 |  I was just wondering when when Foden was challenged near the penalty spot and went down whether
[5214.96 - 5219.52] P:1516.72 E:0.067718 |  we might have perhaps even seen another penalty there but it's only a goal kick for Liverpool
[5219.52 - 5224.48] P:1597.96 E:0.068266 |  good play from Sterling you know good defending from Roberson it was I think John you got across
[5224.48 - 5230.80] P:1700.17 E:0.062856 |  and put the blocking on on Phil Ford and the ball was perfect wasn't it 20 yards out central
[5230.80 - 5235.36] P:1533.34 E:0.066122 |  Bernardo's Bernardo Silver running on to it smashes it just passed the post
[5236.80 - 5242.00] P:1606.61 E:0.075695 |  Liverpool won Manchester City won five live and the World Service from the BBC
[5242.96 - 5251.04] P:1444.06 E:0.066998 |  and all manner of live sports still to come today on BBC radio he has Manne turning and running at
[5251.04 - 5256.72] P:1440.74 E:0.065680 |  the penalty area then giving the ball to Robertson on the left hand side Robertson back towards Fomino
[5258.00 - 5263.52] P:1499.81 E:0.067800 |  little shuffle from him into the penalty area Manne turns crosses left footed headed away by
[5263.52 - 5269.12] P:1393.93 E:0.063202 |  Zincchenko who got up high in Manchester City clear the ball away on the edge of their own penalty
[5269.12 - 5274.40] P:1402.70 E:0.066690 |  area through Gunduan in fact he's running it away Gunduan angles a low pass out to Foden and
[5274.40 - 5280.08] P:1686.86 E:0.073830 |  Foden tries to go around Fabinho and he's tugged over he's holed over Foden certain yellow card
[5280.08 - 5286.24] P:1496.30 E:0.062799 |  for Fabinho Foden was away from him the yellow card to commit no from Fabinho there for his side
[5286.24 - 5292.56] P:1506.28 E:0.062478 |  because Foden was away down that left hand side they had runners go into the box huge the important
[5292.64 - 5299.84] P:1487.74 E:0.062814 |  foul there from Fabinho and Gabriel Jesus is going to come on for Manchester City's
[5299.84 - 5308.24] P:1679.31 E:0.063186 |  first change with 20 minutes to play so free kick for Manchester City on the left hand side
[5308.96 - 5316.00] P:1435.90 E:0.063572 |  so with Jurgen Klopp committing more men forward Pep Guardiola sees this as the time to bring on
[5316.00 - 5321.44] P:1539.09 E:0.069063 |  his number nine won't happen just yet Fabinho Jesus waiting to come on
[5322.24 - 5327.52] P:1441.62 E:0.064257 |  but Gunduan is going to swing in this free kick from the left hand side the score is one one
[5327.52 - 5333.12] P:1624.61 E:0.072314 |  in fact he takes it short to Foden takes a touch left for the ball lovely ball in and it's scored
[5333.12 - 5339.68] P:1724.44 E:0.070992 |  it's to wonder Manchester City no it's not the goal is ruled out it was Stonze who is in there who
[5339.68 - 5345.52] P:1604.57 E:0.062821 |  converted it on the stretch but the flag is up and the goal does not stand it's one one
[5345.52 - 5348.88] P:1657.84 E:0.062613 |  this is going to be so I've just seen it for the first time
[5351.44 - 5361.52] P:1476.36 E:0.066594 |  I tell you what John I think it's the right ball is so close isn't it wow it's a wonderful ball
[5361.52 - 5371.36] P:1643.31 E:0.061163 |  from Foden Stonze stretches out and volleys it in up the post it is so so tight right decision
[5371.84 - 5377.44] P:1347.47 E:0.066173 |  I think it is yeah credit to to Simon Bennett who is the assistant on the far side there were
[5377.44 - 5381.68] P:1532.26 E:0.069061 |  there were other city players in an offside position the question was whether Stonze was but
[5381.68 - 5393.12] P:1372.17 E:0.060988 |  he was but he was and and city the the change sees Márez leave the field Márez who's had a couple
[5393.12 - 5398.08] P:1517.35 E:0.063984 |  of moments but not much more than that yeah I think now we'll see Gabriel Jesus going to
[5398.16 - 5401.12] P:1426.60 E:0.070310 |  the number nine position four to go up to that right hand side
[5403.60 - 5409.52] P:1556.17 E:0.067083 |  so here comes Gabriel Jesus who never scored at Anfield for Manchester City
[5410.24 - 5414.88] P:1565.01 E:0.073150 |  two goals in his last two appearances though in the wins against Poney and Sheffield United
[5416.08 - 5423.36] P:1433.07 E:0.065050 |  Manchester City making the change and Phil Foden has run out towards the right hand side
[5424.08 - 5433.20] P:1549.45 E:0.066466 |  so Liverpool one Manchester City one we've still got Sheffield United Chelsea to come on five

[5529.52 - 5536.64] P:1598.23 E:0.065659 |  into an empty net but Alison what are you doing Phil Ford and magnificent gun to one with two
[5536.64 - 5548.08] P:1441.65 E:0.059775 |  city with two what's Alison doing Alison usually his touches so sure such an important part of
[5548.72 - 5555.52] P:1401.28 E:0.067509 |  of the Jurgen Klopp Liverpool but that was that's a mistake getting the ball away
[5555.52 - 5562.08] P:1499.45 E:0.064823 |  city still had a lot to do Phil Ford and magnificent job brilliant driving run having just taken up
[5562.08 - 5569.20] P:1349.68 E:0.064547 |  the position on the right hand side he drove it past defenders into the penalty area to the
[5569.20 - 5574.48] P:1479.64 E:0.065044 |  byline pulled it back across and Gundoghan was there to score his second goal of the match his
[5574.48 - 5579.20] P:1496.23 E:0.066621 |  second goal in the six yard box and that makes it 11 goals for him this season could have been a
[5579.20 - 5584.88] P:1477.99 E:0.057109 |  hat trick of course if he'd scored his penalty in the first half but that's a that's a forgotten
[5584.88 - 5590.24] P:1462.23 E:0.063074 |  memory now and the way that the city players celebrated together in one corner of Anfield
[5591.76 - 5599.92] P:1493.20 E:0.069011 |  Manchester City who've not won here since 2003 and what a landmark win this would be for for
[5599.92 - 5604.96] P:1512.15 E:0.069966 |  Manchester City in the context of this season the fact that they're doing it at the home of the
[5604.96 - 5610.64] P:1495.08 E:0.063762 |  champions the team Liverpool that finished so far ahead of them last season but this season
[5610.64 - 5616.00] P:1503.18 E:0.071295 |  it's a different story and it's Manchester City who lead by two goals to one and Sterling running
[5616.00 - 5620.40] P:1603.47 E:0.072582 |  Alexander-Arnold cleared it round one side of him very nearly got there Fabinho was able to
[5620.40 - 5625.52] P:1532.94 E:0.066342 |  take it on though. You know John the two Liverpool four backs are brilliant players going forward
[5625.52 - 5631.52] P:1638.19 E:0.061993 |  brilliant but on one-on-one situations there are question marks both goals have been when Sterling
[5631.52 - 5636.88] P:1526.72 E:0.067507 |  drove at Alexander-Arnold got into the box led to a goal went past him easy and that case on the
[5636.88 - 5642.40] P:1496.86 E:0.065028 |  right hand side forwarded driving into the box they couldn't touch him so when you can isolate
[5642.40 - 5648.80] P:1411.74 E:0.063529 |  Liverpool four backs one-on-one they are vulnerable. Yeah but that's not easy to do as as history
[5648.80 - 5655.44] P:1535.84 E:0.064708 |  shows us but Manchester City have been able to do it here today and I think from the
[5655.44 - 5660.16] P:1597.55 E:0.076274 |  outside you know Alison's given it away again and this is trouble for Liverpool the ball is
[5660.16 - 5666.72] P:1741.73 E:0.071037 |  chipped across Sterling's there and heads it in from just a few inches out and it's three one to
[5666.72 - 5674.24] P:1573.14 E:0.068750 |  Manchester City it's their day at Anfield it's Pep Guardiola's day against Jurgen Klopp and the
[5674.24 - 5681.12] P:1666.00 E:0.069756 |  Premier League leaders are winning here now convincingly against the champions on their own
[5681.12 - 5687.20] P:1720.31 E:0.067079 |  ground Sterling with the third Liverpool one Manchester City three and it's another error
[5687.20 - 5694.40] P:1556.79 E:0.058001 |  from Alison that led to this one. I'm in shock what am I watching here we talked about final
[5694.40 - 5702.08] P:1558.37 E:0.064030 |  third recoveries from you know Man City that first half what is he doing Alison he just gives the ball
[5702.08 - 5708.64] P:1525.16 E:0.067232 |  to Bernardo Silva so the ball gets played back to him it's on his right foot he tried it the first
[5708.64 - 5716.56] P:1662.28 E:0.068277 |  time again straight to Bernardo Silva he's driving it and then the audacity to flick it over Alison
[5716.56 - 5724.88] P:1523.63 E:0.060559 |  was magnificent Sterling heads it in from a yard what a Liverpool doing credit man City
[5726.72 - 5733.36] P:1479.50 E:0.064518 |  oh I'm in shock John what is Alison doing John what is he doing twice John he can't believe it
[5733.84 - 5740.32] P:1383.31 E:0.063524 |  but you Liverpool can't believe it you I took for him to make two errors like that I suppose
[5741.12 - 5746.80] P:1560.76 E:0.068234 |  you know it's pressure isn't it it's a pressure situation Liverpool up against it
[5748.08 - 5752.40] P:1568.66 E:0.069244 |  knew that they had to get something out of this game today he's already made one mistake
[5752.40 - 5757.92] P:1374.52 E:0.067868 |  and his reaction was to pick a water bottle out of his goal and spray it over his own head as if he
[5757.92 - 5764.56] P:1497.20 E:0.065589 |  needed to wake himself up as the balls played forward for for Liverpool but they surely must be
[5764.56 - 5769.36] P:1439.91 E:0.066616 |  beyond them now wow Edison comes out and and claims the ball at the other end incredible John
[5770.00 - 5777.44] P:1526.64 E:0.054113 |  you know the first that goal there he had one touch with his right foot played out wide and it was
[5777.44 - 5783.12] P:1686.98 E:0.061409 |  he looked a bit nervous in the second one first time tried to play out wide again straight to
[5783.12 - 5790.08] P:1611.86 E:0.066282 |  Bernardo Silva who was standing on the 18 yard line wide straight to him drove it and then
[5790.08 - 5795.20] P:1496.46 E:0.063537 |  flicked it over him to an unmarked Sterling wow I can't believe what I'm watching
[5797.44 - 5798.16] P:1316.63 E:0.076521 |  well there's only
[5800.88 - 5808.72] P:1559.48 E:0.070394 |  12 minutes to play Liverpool won Manchester City three two goals from Gundawan one from Sterling
[5808.80 - 5814.16] P:1503.91 E:0.063619 |  remember Gundawan missed a penalty in the first half and Liverpool all they've got to show for it
[5814.16 - 5822.64] P:1376.34 E:0.061365 |  is the the Salah penalty in the second half which which came from a Manchester City era so this is
[5824.40 - 5830.64] P:1512.71 E:0.069227 |  very decisively Manchester City's day those fours was bundled over those between two Liverpool
[5830.64 - 5836.00] P:1489.39 E:0.067040 |  players Manchester City with a free kick and they're in absolutely no hurry here they really have
[5836.00 - 5842.08] P:1559.96 E:0.063862 |  got Liverpool exactly where they want them now Liverpool facing a third consecutive home defeat
[5842.72 - 5846.72] P:1486.78 E:0.076750 |  there'll be 10 points behind Manchester City tonight having played a game more
[5848.40 - 5854.64] P:1438.28 E:0.066303 |  and in the form that Manchester City are in this for them will make it 14 wins in a row but what a
[5854.64 - 5862.24] P:1452.25 E:0.060937 |  win this is and also in what we've done yet John they've not won yet but also in in what in what
[5862.24 - 5868.64] P:1603.05 E:0.064380 |  we felt was such a tight race suddenly in the space of really just a couple of weeks or so
[5868.64 - 5873.60] P:1525.79 E:0.063117 |  Manchester City have gone away from the rest City have won and won and won and the others have fallen
[5873.60 - 5878.64] P:1507.82 E:0.064883 |  away you're looking like now City are going to win the Premier League the relegation battle as well
[5878.64 - 5883.60] P:1344.16 E:0.061204 |  the bottom three look like they're going to be the bottom three it looks like now the most interesting
[5883.60 - 5887.60] P:1610.73 E:0.072166 |  interesting thing going forward the Premier League will be the battle for the Champions League places
[5888.32 - 5891.36] P:1530.42 E:0.070497 |  however as you rightly said Robbie it's still 10 minutes to play
[5892.24 - 5897.52] P:1475.96 E:0.069981 |  in Liverpool behind closed doors here at Anfield maybe it would be different if there was a crowd
[5897.52 - 5903.76] P:1385.27 E:0.061413 |  in here trying to stoke them up but it is despite the artificial crowd that you can hear it is
[5904.80 - 5910.96] P:1454.34 E:0.067036 |  really so quiet inside Anfield and Liverpool have to raise themselves and against this Manchester
[5910.96 - 5917.12] P:1445.30 E:0.067917 |  City defence that is the best by a distance in the Premier League this season this is a massively
[5917.12 - 5923.04] P:1417.08 E:0.061119 |  tall order and here this latest ball forward Robertson can't reach it and it's a goal kick to
[5923.04 - 5931.76] P:1410.87 E:0.065585 |  Manchester City you just can't believe how Liverpool haven't created any chances really John
[5931.76 - 5937.60] P:1530.00 E:0.063769 |  two in the first half Manus header have been for me those chance was a difficult one and then the
[5937.60 - 5944.24] P:1521.75 E:0.062974 |  penalty which Salah put away well but they haven't threatened at all I suppose the biggest surprise
[5945.20 - 5949.68] P:1466.84 E:0.067072 |  today is that Liverpool have scored here at Anfield and that was from the penalty spot
[5949.68 - 5955.36] P:1524.84 E:0.066538 |  well Giaz has given it away Milner on the left hand side Milner couldn't get the crossover
[5955.36 - 5960.08] P:1457.38 E:0.060158 |  Penaura Silva blocked it and it's out of play for a throw to Liverpool near the corner frog on the
[5960.08 - 5966.16] P:1520.70 E:0.061416 |  first side but you've got a sage on this Liverpool side you know they've got lots of injuries players
[5966.16 - 5971.60] P:1450.78 E:0.060693 |  playing out of position you know for them to they'll still be where they are on the table I think
[5971.60 - 5975.44] P:1622.27 E:0.066636 |  you've got to give them credit because any side will suffer the injuries they have
[5976.40 - 5980.88] P:1373.98 E:0.070471 |  but you know all sides this season are facing injuries too important
[5980.88 - 5985.04] P:1404.59 E:0.064005 |  John but you know when you think Henderson playing at set now for being up for being
[5985.04 - 5989.20] P:1594.62 E:0.069073 |  up playing at set now they're too midfield plays taking out that position you're missing you to
[5991.52 - 5998.64] P:1614.60 E:0.066800 |  defenders Jotter you know what a big sign and he was so I think they have suffered massively John
[5998.64 - 6003.76] P:1396.17 E:0.065820 |  to be fair because of the way they've had to move players around City with a ball inside their own
[6003.76 - 6011.52] P:1439.44 E:0.062550 |  half City who've missed important players during the course of this season as well and indeed at the
[6011.52 - 6018.16] P:1458.23 E:0.067434 |  moment the win that's been talked about since since Guardiola and top exchanged words on Friday
[6018.80 - 6026.08] P:1467.22 E:0.064809 |  the win that Manchester City had at Chelsea when you know they were missing five six players
[6026.88 - 6034.80] P:1490.02 E:0.065494 |  that was a that was a superb win in difficult circumstances here is Jesus Gabriel Jesus picks
[6034.80 - 6040.48] P:1491.35 E:0.077476 |  out Foden on the right hand side Foden into the penalty area Foden left the chart oh brilliant
[6040.48 - 6047.28] P:1707.42 E:0.071060 |  goal from Phil Foden that wraps it up for Manchester City here at Anfield oh he hit that
[6047.28 - 6054.56] P:1773.34 E:0.069837 |  so well from the angle it flew above Allyson into the roof of the net superb stuff from City here at
[6054.56 - 6063.44] P:1707.31 E:0.061909 |  Anfield Liverpool won Manchester City four that's the pick of the lot stop it stop it Phil Foden
[6063.44 - 6074.72] P:1502.87 E:0.056446 |  that's ridiculous wow set one goal Pepp moving forward and over to that right hand side it was
[6074.72 - 6082.08] P:1719.04 E:0.066930 |  good play Gabriel Jesus switches to play Foden talking about one-on-one situations comes inside
[6082.16 - 6092.64] P:1565.14 E:0.063472 |  one touch pass Robertson and then absolutely smashes it over Allyson who was kneeling down
[6093.28 - 6101.44] P:1558.27 E:0.060699 |  the power beats Allyson you would say John it's straight at him and Allyson for some reason
[6101.44 - 6109.12] P:1458.87 E:0.063539 |  kneels down the power beats him but that shot was hit at some pace Liverpool coming forward but this
[6109.12 - 6114.88] P:1605.34 E:0.067515 |  game's gone now a ball bounces off Alexander-Arnold through to Edison who actually Alexander-Arnold
[6114.88 - 6119.36] P:1484.17 E:0.070708 |  just had a kick out as Edison was looking to pick it up there Alexander-Arnold was running away
[6119.36 - 6124.16] P:1654.08 E:0.070079 |  Edison's not very happy he's wagging his finger at referee Michael Oliver the motions with his foot
[6124.16 - 6129.28] P:1404.79 E:0.060004 |  that Alexander-Arnold had kicked out at him now he's kicked the ball into the cob as well he's not
[6129.28 - 6134.32] P:1624.50 E:0.067610 |  very happy at all about that challenge but there was a one-on-one situation again wasn't it a one-on-one
[6134.32 - 6142.40] P:1528.10 E:0.062298 |  situation in a wide area Foden driving in and you've got to say Pep Guardiola seen it you said it
[6142.40 - 6148.16] P:1583.63 E:0.067147 |  John in commentary you know he reacted bringing Gabriel Jesus on taking matters off putting Foden
[6148.16 - 6153.52] P:1494.83 E:0.059061 |  to that right hand side Foden set went up and scored the fourth brilliant from Pep brilliant from
[6153.52 - 6160.24] P:1542.98 E:0.060676 |  sitting magnificent from Foden with his tenth of the season and Liverpool's home form here at Anfield
[6161.12 - 6166.80] P:1598.92 E:0.064996 |  well it's just fallen apart for them or rather it's been taken apart by
[6167.52 - 6172.32] P:1549.47 E:0.071530 |  they've been taken apart John second half by Manchester City's play but also by the mistakes
[6172.32 - 6178.64] P:1476.77 E:0.060105 |  that have been made allison to the four and one of the most dependable players that Liverpool have
[6178.64 - 6185.84] P:1590.17 E:0.068152 |  had in Klopschine here and now the final change being made by Jürgen Klopp senior class is coming
[6185.84 - 6195.04] P:1296.55 E:0.061384 |  on to replace Andy Robertson who gets a little hug from Jürgen Klopp but Phil Foden went past
[6195.04 - 6200.64] P:1512.56 E:0.066569 |  Robertson too easily really from a Liverpool point of view. Like Sterling did for Alexander
[6200.64 - 6207.12] P:1482.75 E:0.065186 |  Arnold on the first goal listen the magnificent players that never go fullbacks to where they go
[6207.12 - 6214.40] P:1440.46 E:0.061652 |  for listen the team massively miss Virgil van Dijk it's as simple as that you know the way his
[6214.40 - 6220.24] P:1560.97 E:0.064214 |  leadership quality is the way he makes players better around him you know it's a huge huge miss
[6220.24 - 6227.92] P:1443.28 E:0.061280 |  but they've got to get on with it title over taken apart in the second half by a wonderful
[6227.92 - 6233.76] P:1499.04 E:0.064335 |  man city by a wonderful Phil Foden. Five minutes to play the score line at Anfield
[6234.48 - 6243.52] P:1388.14 E:0.061335 |  Liverpool won Manchester City four what a day for for City who is still going on all fronts
[6244.40 - 6248.40] P:1708.17 E:0.070769 |  despite the you know we talked about the injuries they've got the Cup final like
[6248.40 - 6255.60] P:1490.08 E:0.063638 |  Carabao the Carabao Cup final to come against Tottenham in April top of the Premier League
[6256.32 - 6260.56] P:1499.79 E:0.067652 |  in the last 16 of the Champions League against Bruce Munchen Gladbach which is a tie
[6261.20 - 6265.92] P:1655.63 E:0.072503 |  City will be favourites to come through in the FA Cup they go to Swansea on Wednesday that's one
[6265.92 - 6270.56] P:1583.72 E:0.066919 |  of our commentaries it'll start off on Sports Extra that one five thirty kickoff on Wednesday
[6271.12 - 6276.24] P:1421.82 E:0.069043 |  Liverpool with Alexander-Arnold out of the FA Cup now well off the pace in the Premier League
[6277.44 - 6282.80] P:1393.52 E:0.058468 |  winner throw in winner corner here on the right Alexander-Arnold playing it off
[6282.80 - 6288.80] P:1531.01 E:0.064854 |  Zinchenko he's going to leave it for Shaqiri Shaqiri gives the single signal two arms raised
[6289.44 - 6295.20] P:1402.37 E:0.065538 |  we're in the 87th minute though in Manchester City surely can't be caught here Shaqiri
[6295.76 - 6299.60] P:1487.98 E:0.069379 |  to take this in it goes to the edge of the six yard box stones got his head to it
[6300.24 - 6305.68] P:1455.97 E:0.065327 |  and the ball is deflected out towards the far side John on Fordham's goal you know I've only seen it
[6307.68 - 6314.08] P:1618.67 E:0.066803 |  twice do you think Allyson needed to like go down because it was straight at him did the power
[6314.08 - 6321.60] P:1532.30 E:0.059471 |  beat him if he stands up straight he saves it it was ferociously hit by Fordham and I'll be very
[6321.60 - 6326.88] P:1513.40 E:0.066705 |  interested to hear later I'm sure somebody will put a timer on that and find the speed of it but it
[6326.88 - 6332.72] P:1560.30 E:0.066129 |  was so sweetly and purely struck by Fordham but it did go above the head of the the Liverpool goalkeeper
[6332.72 - 6336.80] P:1542.36 E:0.066716 |  who dropped down as you say Robbie on his name all over the top Edison comes gets a punch on it
[6336.80 - 6342.64] P:1462.88 E:0.063014 |  away from Sario Mani Firmino plays it out towards the far side Simicasa is there but Manchester
[6342.64 - 6347.44] P:1478.22 E:0.060897 |  City bring it away towards the halfway line Alexander-Arnold is able to to get a touch
[6347.44 - 6352.00] P:1537.76 E:0.070394 |  thought to take it back into the Liverpool half and Simicasa will play it back towards us but the way
[6352.00 - 6357.36] P:1525.87 E:0.067733 |  the City have pressed Liverpool John the amount of final third recoveries they've got high up in
[6357.36 - 6363.76] P:1588.09 E:0.055526 |  Liverpool's final third press them make fours in errors listen Allyson you know they are two
[6364.48 - 6369.60] P:1546.01 E:0.068772 |  shocking errors for the two goals but you've got to credit City John for the press
[6369.92 - 6377.84] P:1569.32 E:0.067965 |  Manchester City heading for their first victory here since May 2003 it was the last match of that
[6377.84 - 6384.96] P:1372.60 E:0.066551 |  season it's Kevin Keegan's Manchester City former Liverpool striker who was the manager of City
[6385.84 - 6393.12] P:1477.72 E:0.068416 |  when actually that day City started with Anelka and Fowler up front two former Liverpool players
[6393.12 - 6397.44] P:1431.01 E:0.062632 |  and Anelka scored the late winner but City's record here is absolutely terrible
[6398.08 - 6404.88] P:1473.93 E:0.065835 |  the that's their only win in 33 visits to Anfield when was the last time Liverpool could see the
[6404.88 - 6408.88] P:1418.87 E:0.061927 |  four goals in it in the hole in the Premier League have they in the Premier League well
[6410.40 - 6420.88] P:1486.91 E:0.065677 |  I'm sure they will I'm sure they will but unfortunately my assistant Juliet has disappeared
[6421.36 - 6427.92] P:1435.88 E:0.064654 |  downstairs to do the interviews Zincenko will play it in field maybe somebody back at base
[6427.92 - 6435.12] P:1611.20 E:0.064524 |  can look that one up for us Steve Crossman if you're listening here's Shaqiri back to Milner
[6436.00 - 6441.84] P:1484.63 E:0.062936 |  now it's curled into the box by Salah Milner's after it Zincenko gets there first and clears it away
[6441.92 - 6452.48] P:1474.32 E:0.062748 |  Manchester City four one up at Anfield in Liverpool at what was there former fortress
[6452.48 - 6459.36] P:1564.24 E:0.064625 |  here at Anfield well suddenly that form has completely disappeared the Arsenal score four jump

[6515.36 - 6520.48] P:1538.14 E:0.068593 |  says that Manchester City will relinquish the lead that they have even with most of the second half
[6520.48 - 6525.68] P:1381.33 E:0.059225 |  of the season to go crossing the left hand side from Simicast too close to Edison and we're into

[6602.72 - 6607.76] P:1558.36 E:0.063034 |  well thinkable free kick Sheffield takes it down into the full back position
[6608.40 - 6612.88] P:1634.50 E:0.069959 |  and Liverpool unusually this week because they're out of the FA Cup actually have a break this week
[6613.44 - 6617.60] P:1530.14 E:0.068314 |  but when it gets going again for them next Saturday lest they're away

[6654.24 - 6658.56] P:1499.95 E:0.062793 |  but Liverpool win the ball back in attack with Wijnaldum who plays it forward
[6658.56 - 6661.76] P:1780.81 E:0.074213 |  that Foden their scorer of that excellent goal is found.

[6746.48 - 6754.16] P:1897.29 E:0.063988 |  brilliant title race over John Murray and all after Manchester City missed a penalty before
[6754.16 - 6761.28] P:1964.44 E:0.053562 |  halftime Ilkai Gundawan but in the second half goodness me they made up for that Gundawan made
[6761.28 - 6767.04] P:2097.27 E:0.061330 |  up for it he scored twice Sterling scored Foden scored Salah from the penalty spot briefly made
[6767.04 - 6774.32] P:2019.64 E:0.065270 |  it one-one but this Manchester City team are right in their stride this is 14 wins in a row
[6774.32 - 6779.92] P:2048.56 E:0.055481 |  in all competitions they've won 10 successive matches in the Premier League they've opened a
[6779.92 - 6786.56] P:1977.23 E:0.053075 |  five-point lead at the top they're 10 points ahead of Liverpool and they've won Manchester City at

[6793.92 - 6802.40] P:2045.75 E:0.043724 |  Liverpool one Manchester City four and remarkably that is three back-to-back defeats for Liverpool
[6802.40 - 6811.84] P:2047.07 E:0.047339 |  and field since they went 68 games unbeaten Burnley shocked them Brighton stunned them today
[6811.84 - 6817.28] P:1974.46 E:0.047969 |  Robbie Savage Manchester City have smashed them it's the first time isn't it in the Premier League
[6818.08 - 6824.80] P:1879.34 E:0.055416 |  either that's Liverpool have lost three home games in a row this yeah they absolutely tore them apart
[6824.80 - 6830.32] P:2062.52 E:0.056392 |  listen Alison's mistakes he probably won't do that again all season but the way you know Jurgen
[6830.32 - 6835.68] P:2107.84 E:0.056071 |  Klopp wants his team to play he does it so well he'll bounce back from that the big question is now
[6835.68 - 6841.76] P:2059.05 E:0.052643 |  for 606 Steve is will Liverpool's home form you know they need their players back you look at Everton
[6841.76 - 6845.60] P:2095.98 E:0.062888 |  you look at Chelsea now under Thomas Tugol you look at Aston Villa if they win their two games
[6845.60 - 6851.92] P:2002.25 E:0.047441 |  and they go above Liverpool before the start of the season we just said right with 15 games to go
[6852.56 - 6857.92] P:2010.87 E:0.051182 |  Liverpool have got significant injuries will they get a Champions League place wow all
[6858.48 - 6861.20] P:1748.88 E:0.051076 |  five nine six nine three for later Steve that isn't quite incredible but
[6862.08 - 6866.96] P:1954.65 E:0.053344 |  Steve what about Phil Fordham what about Gunderman Phil Fordham was unbelievable
[6868.64 - 6872.24] P:2019.74 E:0.055158 |  with I'm just looking at the message we're getting 85058 at five live sport
[6872.24 - 6877.76] P:2038.74 E:0.060627 |  AJ Phil Foden the kid the kid is clear he's got to start for England at the Euros
[6878.40 - 6883.20] P:2019.69 E:0.054554 |  Reese is reminding us that Phil Foden was only three the last time Manchester City won at Anfield
[6883.20 - 6890.16] P:2027.03 E:0.053610 |  that the power on that strike I mean if if there was ever a way to cap an absolutely merciless
[6890.16 - 6896.24] P:1929.96 E:0.044468 |  performance it was that yeah you know the first half didn't really get going you know the missed
[6896.24 - 6902.96] P:2028.29 E:0.051700 |  penalty but then the second half it's just the way they played you know moving you know before the
[6902.96 - 6908.00] P:1806.07 E:0.056710 |  game myself and Pat were talking about Phil Fordham and how well he's done out wide and you know
[6908.00 - 6912.88] P:1922.20 E:0.062366 |  Pat said inevitably the long term he'll be playing central he started central today yes in a in a
[6912.88 - 6918.32] P:2051.28 E:0.053111 |  force nine position you know but then when he moved out wide they couldn't stop him he was sensational
[6919.84 - 6924.24] P:1982.24 E:0.054339 |  I guess what he's going to make this doubly difficult to take if your Liverpool Robbie is that
[6924.24 - 6929.12] P:1969.53 E:0.054368 |  I mean there were errors and we've mentioned the Alisson error but ultimately they've lost four one
[6929.12 - 6936.16] P:2026.85 E:0.049204 |  in a game where Manchester City gave them two absolute gifts a missed penalty and an error from
[6936.16 - 6941.68] P:1939.43 E:0.052227 |  from Diaz that we've just never seen coming over the course of his career at City so far yeah what
[6941.68 - 6946.72] P:1965.16 E:0.062384 |  was social media saying Steve on on the penalty you know that I listened there was a little bit
[6946.72 - 6952.00] P:1939.50 E:0.057302 |  of content on Salah what were they saying well I spent all of my time in the first half looking
[6952.00 - 6958.00] P:1970.94 E:0.057396 |  up your yellow cards Robbie so I couldn't tell you I mean the one thing I would say about it is
[6958.00 - 6966.48] P:2023.23 E:0.045600 |  it's not just a penalty is it if if Diaz puts enough into Salah to bring him down if he impedes
[6966.48 - 6971.68] P:2007.31 E:0.047788 |  him at all it's a penalty but ultimately in the end it's made no difference has it no it's made
[6971.68 - 6976.88] P:2057.08 E:0.053104 |  no difference at all just the way City moved the ball the way they got in between the lines just
[6976.88 - 6981.68] P:2093.30 E:0.049058 |  the way you know they threatened Liverpool the biggest thing was I listened to Thomas Tuchel
[6981.68 - 6986.32] P:1915.21 E:0.060805 |  saying about Chelsea you know when he was excited about winning the recovery in the ball in the
[6986.32 - 6990.64] P:2001.75 E:0.054626 |  opposition's final third City done that a lot today didn't they against this Liverpool side they
[6990.64 - 6997.20] P:2080.55 E:0.046521 |  pressed them they hassled them they hurried them and Allyson yes he made two errors and you know
[6997.20 - 7001.92] P:2067.63 E:0.055190 |  but that's the way you want your team to play there will be errors but just with his right foot
[7001.92 - 7008.96] P:2076.20 E:0.044254 |  you know across himself it was just bizarre mistakes I'm just reading Johnson Quartz from
[7008.96 - 7014.24] P:1993.78 E:0.055858 |  from Phil Forden on TV he's already spoken since that goal and the victory talking about does he
[7014.24 - 7018.32] P:2062.06 E:0.059848 |  enjoy playing in the false 90 said yeah I enjoy it you can drop in you don't have to stay up front
[7018.32 - 7024.24] P:1983.46 E:0.052104 |  you can move it's something that I need to learn I can make it part of my game I wonder if if false
[7024.24 - 7030.00] P:2066.48 E:0.054564 |  nine is actually almost the perfect position for Phil Forden because you can do what you want with
[7030.00 - 7036.00] P:2098.60 E:0.047692 |  it and he's such an instinctive player I don't know I think personally I would say central really
[7036.00 - 7041.28] P:1937.08 E:0.057978 |  in that attacking in the sort of Kevin De Bruyne position either either side of the rotary but I
[7041.28 - 7045.28] P:1976.28 E:0.052276 |  mean he can play there can't he can play other side of of rotary he can play on the left up front
[7045.28 - 7051.12] P:2028.24 E:0.054235 |  he can play on the right up front and he can play in this role as well he is truly versatile he is a
[7051.12 - 7056.72] P:1970.12 E:0.043832 |  very very good footballer I mean he can play anywhere Robbie you could put anywhere and he
[7056.72 - 7061.20] P:1639.27 E:0.053514 |  would have a massive impact he could play anywhere on the on the on the park no question about it if
[7061.20 - 7066.48] P:2010.71 E:0.043176 |  he was left back right backs you know I'm not sure he'd have the discipline the players and set
[7066.48 - 7070.24] P:1841.31 E:0.059889 |  her up but he probably would because he just loves playing with the football is that clip isn't it on
[7070.24 - 7075.28] P:2088.18 E:0.063983 |  social media when he is in the street in Stockport with his mates with the ball doing all tricks and
[7075.28 - 7081.12] P:1870.46 E:0.051989 |  that's how he plays on the pitch in the Premier League no fear you know wow what a performance
[7081.12 - 7085.60] P:1887.40 E:0.051833 |  but his best work was out wide it was magnificent that's the those are the sort of players that
[7085.60 - 7090.16] P:1964.41 E:0.068877 |  you're going to be looking for in your foundation Robbie oh yes yeah John thank you very much
[7090.16 - 7095.12] P:1883.62 E:0.063465 |  but that's you know that's the idea isn't it yeah to get those kids just who are who play on the
[7095.12 - 7102.16] P:1890.88 E:0.053027 |  streets yeah and develop them yeah that's and that you know it's it is it's genuinely heartwarming
[7102.16 - 7106.96] P:1837.78 E:0.058046 |  to see a local player yeah I know you were talking Steve in the early part of the programme
[7106.96 - 7113.12] P:2023.47 E:0.051742 |  and on the football daily this morning about local players who come through and and and it's that sort
[7113.12 - 7119.60] P:1956.33 E:0.046727 |  of player isn't it the supporters want to see playing for their team yeah absolutely and you
[7119.60 - 7123.44] P:2051.19 E:0.060411 |  know we're now not far away from the stage Robbie you know we've had so many discussions we had
[7123.44 - 7128.40] P:1912.06 E:0.058281 |  another one today about what Phil Forden has learned from David Silver it's not going to be long before
[7128.40 - 7131.76] P:1946.47 E:0.062756 |  other players are trying to learn from Phil Forden if they know already yeah it's not just what he's
[7131.76 - 7135.84] P:1795.23 E:0.056483 |  learned from David Silver is what he's learned from Bernardo Silver from Gundewan from Kevin
[7135.84 - 7141.12] P:1933.98 E:0.062489 |  de Bruyne from Sergio Aguero from Riyad Márez from Raheem Sterling you know all those players he's
[7141.12 - 7146.64] P:2015.39 E:0.048334 |  learning off you know in his education you know his development of Man City you know what a player
[7146.64 - 7152.72] P:2043.63 E:0.054850 |  Pep Guardiola you've got to give him huge amounts of credit for the way you know when all the questions
[7152.80 - 7157.76] P:1962.29 E:0.062905 |  why is he playing should he go out alone you know he knew what he was doing and now you're seeing it
[7157.76 - 7164.56] P:2003.05 E:0.046979 |  he is absolutely sensational and we talk a lot about mentality and we usually talk about mentality
[7164.56 - 7168.32] P:1993.10 E:0.056310 |  to do with Liverpool and of course there's that that famous line which became a little bit of a
[7168.32 - 7172.56] P:2008.69 E:0.060266 |  cliche in the end around mentality monsters well if you want to talk about mentality we're talking
[7172.56 - 7178.40] P:1941.91 E:0.049659 |  today about Ilkai Gundewan aren't we to miss a penalty that badly in a game of this significance
[7178.40 - 7181.92] P:1689.28 E:0.054761 |  and then come back and have that second half yeah you were hammering them at half time when you're
[7181.92 - 7190.32] P:1904.42 E:0.059751 |  saying I said he was past six relax relax relax yeah I'm brilliant you know one of his best
[7190.32 - 7195.68] P:1934.77 E:0.058343 |  scenes I think is this his best score scoring season John? Yes, best scoring season yeah but 11 goals
[7195.68 - 7201.92] P:1973.47 E:0.054102 |  John said it every single city player is playing to probably need enough their best of their ability
[7201.92 - 7207.04] P:1996.82 E:0.049923 |  there's not one bad play in a city shoot in the last was it 14 or 15 games John?
[7207.04 - 7215.20] P:2052.66 E:0.044042 |  Yeah it's 14 they've won in a row now I think if you're going to be very picky you might say
[7215.20 - 7222.32] P:1945.37 E:0.052206 |  mares you know perhaps you could see better form from him and listen what I'm doing there is
[7222.32 - 7229.12] P:1980.51 E:0.051403 |  you're harsh no but I'm making the point that he's probably the only one out of that team that
[7229.12 - 7236.80] P:2023.86 E:0.040863 |  started today that is not in rich form. Robbie before we let you go what do you want people
[7236.88 - 7243.04] P:1935.58 E:0.054687 |  to call in for six or six later on this now? Well you've got to say city title's over for me
[7244.24 - 7250.08] P:1888.65 E:0.047596 |  that top four is it unthinkable that Liverpool might not end up in a champions league position?
[7251.20 - 7256.88] P:1807.68 E:0.053441 |  Wow. Oh wait I wait five nine oh nine six nine three. Yeah can't wait for that later tonight nine
[7256.88 - 7263.36] P:1978.93 E:0.055820 |  p.m. Robbie thank you very much. He's off. Thank you mate. That was fast. Almost out the door.
[7263.36 - 7269.20] P:1976.20 E:0.054814 |  Oh almost out the door. Robbie Savage is hurtling his way back it's about a now a
[7269.20 - 7274.08] P:2060.25 E:0.056165 |  trip probably back to media city but he will be back for six or six a little bit later.
[7274.08 - 7279.20] P:1844.88 E:0.055794 |  That was the Russell if I'm taking his mini eggs with him as well. Oh wow he's left you with nothing
[7279.20 - 7283.28] P:1804.39 E:0.044379 |  John. Left with nothing as usual and you've got to stay with us for a while as well.
[7284.40 - 7288.96] P:2018.42 E:0.063692 |  Wow what a result. Liverpool won Manchester City four in the Premier League loads more reaction
[7288.96 - 7293.20] P:2064.92 E:0.051372 |  coming to that as you can imagine then we'll get into Sheffield United Chelsea which kicks off

[7472.24 - 7476.64] P:1933.23 E:0.058887 |  bit of shock. I think and we also have with us the former Everton and England midfielder Leon
[7476.64 - 7480.80] P:1888.92 E:0.058885 |  Osmond who's at Bramble lane for us tonight evening Leon. Good evening. Well I tell you what let's
[7480.80 - 7485.44] P:2025.46 E:0.062586 |  just start by getting you know immediate reaction from from the two of you Leon to what we've just seen.
[7487.04 - 7491.60] P:1520.84 E:0.064195 |  Well surprised first of all the fact that you know Liverpool have conceded four goals at home.
[7491.60 - 7496.88] P:1650.77 E:0.067155 |  I can't even remember the last time the last time that happened. You know they did break their score
[7496.88 - 7501.76] P:1676.74 E:0.064987 |  in duck which again is another surprising run that they're on albeit from a penalty kick.
[7501.84 - 7506.16] P:1813.72 E:0.069595 |  They're just not the same side at the moment in Manchester City went there full of confidence and
[7506.16 - 7512.08] P:1877.89 E:0.066811 |  took full advantage. It was amazing seeing that second half play out wasn't it considering the fact
[7512.08 - 7518.08] P:1940.93 E:0.068227 |  that so often these games turning to sort of damp squibs and there's a huge build up and then
[7518.08 - 7521.60] P:1927.38 E:0.061145 |  suddenly you see Neil near a halftime you're thinking oh well this is a nothing and then
[7521.60 - 7525.12] P:1816.17 E:0.074407 |  suddenly it just burst into life like that. I was wondering Leon did you ever any thoughts on
[7525.12 - 7529.84] P:1953.79 E:0.069745 |  sort of why it happened because it looked as if Pep Guardiola might have just changed things a bit
[7529.84 - 7534.56] P:1785.71 E:0.061388 |  gone with the two up top just open the game up maybe. I think the tactical change he made was to
[7534.56 - 7541.68] P:1670.72 E:0.065547 |  move Phil Foden into a wider position you know he's played there quite a number of times in recent
[7541.68 - 7546.00] P:1715.51 E:0.065419 |  weeks and been very very good but I thought it was just you know it was as if the two teams were
[7546.00 - 7551.36] P:1679.47 E:0.066318 |  sort of weighing each other up in the first half just trying to get to halftime without having overexposed
[7551.36 - 7556.08] P:1616.88 E:0.065698 |  themselves and then in the second half they just stepped it up and you know when you've got. Stand by Leon
[7556.16 - 7561.60] P:1776.09 E:0.048580 |  We're going to go live down to Julie at pitch side. Yeah I'm just waiting I can see him
[7561.60 - 7567.44] P:1909.71 E:0.058445 |  Ilkai Gundewan is about to enter the stage. I say the stage because we're right next to the goal here
[7567.44 - 7574.00] P:1752.26 E:0.056160 |  at the Cop at Anfield and he's just taking his face covering off Ilkai. What can I say can you
[7574.00 - 7580.72] P:1824.45 E:0.040392 |  just sum up that game you missed the penalty but but two goals as well. Yeah I mean obviously I'm
[7580.72 - 7586.40] P:1738.83 E:0.043528 |  very happy that we've won this game I think we fully deserved it we played great especially the
[7586.40 - 7593.84] P:1713.78 E:0.049544 |  second half in the half where we concede the equaliser. I think we did really well apart from the
[7593.84 - 7600.48] P:1651.98 E:0.059915 |  penalty I don't think they had any chance to score a goal and I think we moved the ball very well
[7600.48 - 7607.60] P:1699.10 E:0.044755 |  we deserved to score a few more goals and all in one I think it was a great performance. What about
[7607.68 - 7611.68] P:1681.02 E:0.062701 |  your own performance like because obviously we saw the penalty miss and Manchester City penalties
[7611.68 - 7615.92] P:1600.26 E:0.061562 |  against Liverpool this does seem to be a problem but then obviously you make you become a hero
[7615.92 - 7623.84] P:1782.97 E:0.051775 |  straight away. Yeah I mean I need to admit that missing a penalty is always a bad thing rubbish
[7623.84 - 7629.20] P:1644.68 E:0.058741 |  I mean I mean especially early in the game there's always a danger of dropping confidence
[7630.64 - 7636.96] P:1717.66 E:0.046641 |  but I try just I just try to do after after missing it just try to do the the simple things as
[7636.96 - 7645.12] P:1688.34 E:0.050434 |  good as possible as I always try to do try to don't get disrupted by by that penalty and just
[7645.12 - 7652.00] P:1597.99 E:0.050398 |  try to try to keep going helping my team yeah to win here and it worked out quite well maybe I was
[7652.00 - 7656.96] P:1599.63 E:0.064262 |  a bit lucky to be in the right spaces but I always try to be there you know when I when I smell there
[7656.96 - 7663.12] P:1608.07 E:0.043318 |  there could be a danger in front of the opponent's goal and yeah of course I'm happy about the two
[7663.12 - 7670.48] P:1613.34 E:0.053598 |  goals and it was maybe also kind of a relief but I'm much much much much happier about the result
[7670.48 - 7674.24] P:1590.15 E:0.060997 |  and about the way we've played. Seafield Folder just walking away I mean everybody wants to speak
[7674.24 - 7680.48] P:1802.46 E:0.056030 |  to him as well the build up to your to the second goal and and the part he had to play in that.
[7681.36 - 7688.48] P:1699.29 E:0.051647 |  Yeah Phil deserves all all the credit he's doing he's doing really well I think compared to to the
[7688.48 - 7694.56] P:1724.13 E:0.052183 |  last season he stepped up this game again this season and he's still so young we can't forget that
[7695.84 - 7701.52] P:1506.99 E:0.056112 |  and yeah there's still a lot a lot to come for him and I'm obviously very happy to have him
[7701.52 - 7708.56] P:1629.53 E:0.054328 |  in our team he gives us an incredible an incredible quality and yeah it's just great to see to see
[7708.56 - 7713.04] P:1658.18 E:0.061519 |  that Yankee playing. You said you could have scored more as a team and you you deserve to score more
[7713.04 - 7718.08] P:1766.19 E:0.051274 |  that was a real statement of intent from Manchester City the points difference between you and
[7718.08 - 7725.36] P:1640.79 E:0.052719 |  Liverpool now at the top of the table your 10 points clear of Liverpool the the grip you have in this
[7725.36 - 7737.44] P:1706.93 E:0.043591 |  title race is it yours? No it's definitely not we need to stay humble we know that we need to put
[7737.44 - 7742.24] P:1616.21 E:0.055809 |  performance like that every single game because every single game is tough doesn't matter if it's
[7742.24 - 7747.44] P:1565.28 E:0.062697 |  away at Anfield or playing home against a Sheffield United who is at the moment bottom of the league
[7747.44 - 7754.16] P:1656.26 E:0.055115 |  you know but who have also incredible qualities so even that game playing in our own stadium was
[7754.16 - 7761.76] P:1678.74 E:0.049579 |  so tight and so close that every single game has its own character and his own challenges and we
[7761.76 - 7768.24] P:1749.59 E:0.049209 |  need to take every single one and just need to keep going like like we did today and then I think
[7768.24 - 7773.44] P:1572.13 E:0.055853 |  it's gonna gonna be a great season for us. That's 14 wins in a row Ilkay that's that's good going
[7773.44 - 7778.24] P:1651.88 E:0.053602 |  that's brilliant going. That's good yeah it's good and obviously the aim the target is to keep going
[7778.96 - 7784.16] P:1732.51 E:0.046894 |  not just in terms of the result in terms of in terms of playing like that and if we do so the
[7784.16 - 7788.48] P:1765.80 E:0.058784 |  results will come automatically. Well we wish you well thank you very much for your time it's freezing
[7788.48 - 7793.92] P:1875.27 E:0.058613 |  thank you thank you. Ilkay Gundawan who scored twice at Anfield this afternoon live on Premier League
[7793.92 - 7798.48] P:1975.46 E:0.057270 |  Sunday with Juliet Farrington I love that John I mean he talked about the simple things the simple
[7798.56 - 7804.80] P:1799.65 E:0.041706 |  things like scoring two at Anfield in a half. He's an impressive character Gundawan I've interviewed
[7804.80 - 7812.32] P:1987.37 E:0.061348 |  him myself several times very thoughtful he's a clever guy as well as being a superb footballer
[7812.32 - 7817.76] P:1779.66 E:0.064930 |  who is having his best season I think it would be fair to say since he's come to Manchester City and
[7818.64 - 7823.28] P:1928.94 E:0.069998 |  you know that's against a fairly high bar that he's had over the years but as I suggested during
[7823.28 - 7830.08] P:1960.91 E:0.060179 |  the commentary it almost seems as though he's emerged from the the the shadow of David Silva who
[7830.08 - 7835.92] P:1937.16 E:0.066989 |  you'd expect to do all of the beautiful things and now he's doing lots of beautiful things as well
[7835.92 - 7841.60] P:1876.68 E:0.057206 |  with the football and scoring good goals and I think that gave us as well an insight into his
[7841.60 - 7849.28] P:1871.25 E:0.061779 |  psyche as well and how he thinks about the game and you know the standard the level of a top class
[7849.36 - 7855.04] P:1862.50 E:0.049692 |  footballer. Yeah do you know Leon I was thinking as I listened to that it was quite impressive that
[7855.04 - 7859.36] P:1773.68 E:0.060084 |  he picked himself up from the penalty miss to have that second half but actually when you listen to
[7859.36 - 7865.04] P:1837.26 E:0.059491 |  him talk you think yeah I can understand how someone with your character was able to put that to one
[7865.04 - 7870.64] P:1813.35 E:0.063364 |  side. Yeah it just seems so calm and so steady doesn't he and you know doesn't seem to be affected
[7870.64 - 7876.24] P:1791.05 E:0.073323 |  by individual errors or mistakes that happen within a game he knows the goal of the team he knows what
[7876.24 - 7881.84] P:1686.06 E:0.067184 |  his part in that is and he's he's wanting to go and go out and show that on the field and you know
[7881.84 - 7886.64] P:1741.01 E:0.063541 |  as John said he's been in terrific form of late you know he really has been that you know even
[7886.64 - 7891.76] P:1772.19 E:0.071038 |  when Kevin De Bruyne was fit it was Gunduan it was probably still the standout player and since he's
[7891.76 - 7896.00] P:1898.87 E:0.071562 |  been injured you know he's he's took the reins and really run with them you know then you wonder
[7896.00 - 7901.44] P:1807.18 E:0.070599 |  who else is going to you know want to be the main man and Phil Foden you know you can't say that he's
[7901.44 - 7906.32] P:1798.41 E:0.065449 |  not stepped up and showing everybody that they're right to believe in the hype that he's had since
[7906.32 - 7910.96] P:1861.90 E:0.074559 |  he was a young man he's really developed into into a top player this talk should he be playing more
[7910.96 - 7915.76] P:1790.47 E:0.070109 |  central but at the moment if he's performing like he is in those wider areas for Pep Guardiola then
[7915.76 - 7922.56] P:1881.31 E:0.051717 |  I'd keep him there. The thing that links the two together Ben and I'm talking about Foden and
[7922.56 - 7927.92] P:1858.43 E:0.060931 |  Gunduan here is they're both players who at times have had to settle for a place on the bench under
[7927.92 - 7932.88] P:1986.75 E:0.060789 |  Pep Guardiola and yet they're both players who have shown what they can do when they are you so
[7932.88 - 7936.96] P:1865.06 E:0.063871 |  that is all testament to the manager and keeping players happy even though their world class are
[7936.96 - 7942.64] P:1854.37 E:0.058871 |  not always playing. Yeah there are testament to their patience as well because there was so much
[7942.64 - 7947.04] P:1883.96 E:0.069983 |  talk wasn't there about Phil Foden about whether he needed to go elsewhere or that perhaps he needed
[7947.04 - 7951.92] P:1810.61 E:0.069784 |  to go somewhere on loan and he consistently said the entire time that he felt as if his time has
[7951.92 - 7955.92] P:1788.23 E:0.067852 |  come and he was going to get game time and I think Pep Guardiola has been really clever because he
[7955.92 - 7960.56] P:1916.42 E:0.076863 |  gradually integrated him hasn't he he's gradually seen him drifting to to more and more game time
[7960.56 - 7964.16] P:1830.85 E:0.072062 |  and in multiple positions as well he's not just popped him in one place and said look that's your
[7964.16 - 7968.16] P:1785.86 E:0.065752 |  spot he's drifted across the entire at the front line playing deeper as well and I have to say
[7968.16 - 7972.48] P:1873.83 E:0.070798 |  today with Phil Foden the thing that impressed me most is just the way that he carried himself
[7972.48 - 7976.72] P:1940.32 E:0.069347 |  he looked like he belonged on that stage there were times where he was sort of holding off for

[7981.28 - 7986.56] P:1832.45 E:0.062537 |  mean the the composure and the technique on his finish was just absolutely stunning as well.
[7986.56 - 7993.12] P:2006.01 E:0.058053 |  I'm not sure you know whether that was then a genuinely an option or something that was talked
[7993.12 - 8000.40] P:1990.07 E:0.055479 |  about within Manchester City in terms of sending Foden out on loan because over the years and it
[8000.40 - 8004.96] P:2017.21 E:0.065707 |  is years now that we've seen him develop whenever I've listened to Guardiola and admittedly this
[8004.96 - 8009.84] P:2041.91 E:0.061154 |  is when he's speaking publicly he's always been quite steadfast in that he felt that the best
[8009.84 - 8015.28] P:1982.36 E:0.060151 |  place for him to develop was at City and to be around those players whether you know certainly in
[8015.28 - 8020.88] P:1992.23 E:0.065080 |  training and the influence etc etc and that he would he would get his chance and okay you know
[8020.88 - 8026.80] P:2047.32 E:0.055328 |  you're right it has it's taken it feels like it's taken a long time for him to get to the position
[8026.80 - 8031.28] P:1747.43 E:0.069222 |  that that he is now but he's there now isn't he? He believed in his qualities John didn't he?
[8031.28 - 8034.96] P:1678.42 E:0.072372 |  And what he didn't want and I remember him saying publicly he didn't want him to go and learn
[8035.60 - 8040.32] P:1813.80 E:0.067311 |  I'm not going to say bad habits but habits that aren't what Pep wants you know Pep wants to teach
[8040.32 - 8044.64] P:1727.94 E:0.074393 |  him how he wants him to play he doesn't want him to go on loan and learn how another manager wants
[8044.64 - 8049.84] P:1841.72 E:0.065472 |  him to play he wants him to develop in his style and you know I've been saying for years you don't
[8049.84 - 8054.88] P:1728.68 E:0.068224 |  need to go out and play on loan if you you've got a trusted manager if you've got those quality
[8054.88 - 8059.60] P:1869.66 E:0.064851 |  players around you there's sometimes people are in such a rush to make it into the first team I
[8059.60 - 8065.52] P:1856.18 E:0.063334 |  didn't get in regular till I was 23 and you know played till I was 35 so you know there's there's
[8065.52 - 8070.08] P:1834.13 E:0.073166 |  such a long time ahead for Phil Fode in his career he's still developing he's still got an awful
[8070.08 - 8074.72] P:1937.20 E:0.068374 |  long way and he will develop and change positions throughout his career because he's such an
[8074.72 - 8081.36] P:1875.20 E:0.063498 |  intelligent footballing as has Pep's done showing him different roles different positions false nine
[8081.36 - 8086.16] P:1791.73 E:0.067746 |  out wide on the right within the game today we've seen him play left we've seen him play deep
[8086.16 - 8090.72] P:1895.34 E:0.067900 |  you know think of the player he'll be you know when he really hits his peak in his mid to late 20s
[8090.72 - 8097.44] P:1975.54 E:0.072615 |  he's he's always spoken of him Guardiola as though he is a very special case I've heard him do it many
[8097.44 - 8105.04] P:1924.78 E:0.064510 |  times and and because it's Guardiola when he talks about Fode in the way that he has you think wow
[8105.68 - 8112.16] P:1862.41 E:0.064572 |  you know he he must be special well I can remember John I interviewed Bernardo Silva
[8112.24 - 8118.00] P:1878.70 E:0.067410 |  probably about a year ago and he said within two years I think Phil Foden will be one of the best
[8118.00 - 8124.56] P:1991.68 E:0.060710 |  in the world which kind of paints a picture I think doesn't it of sometimes someone is just so good
[8124.56 - 8130.32] P:2039.52 E:0.058547 |  you perhaps don't need to worry about saying it yeah but very often players and certainly managers
[8130.32 - 8136.08] P:1938.42 E:0.057559 |  would shy away wouldn't they of saying that sort of thing publicly but but with Foden they haven't
[8136.80 - 8141.28] P:1827.11 E:0.064187 |  and did you see the way they celebrated that fourth goal when he scored even Edison came running up
[8141.28 - 8146.24] P:1856.51 E:0.060375 |  the pitch it wasn't just delight that they'd scored the fourth or delight that they'd won the game
[8146.24 - 8152.00] P:1954.21 E:0.064400 |  they were genuinely delighted that Phil Foden was the guy who'd done it and he showed his quality on
[8152.00 - 8156.24] P:1857.68 E:0.069028 |  the field if you watch back the joy in each one of those Manchester City's faces they were rubbing
[8156.24 - 8160.64] P:1774.92 E:0.070266 |  him on the head like he's you know a little brother that they've all really pleased he's come to the
[8160.64 - 8165.36] P:1808.61 E:0.064626 |  fore and you know they know his quality they all believe in him within the club and now everyone
[8165.36 - 8171.60] P:1842.23 E:0.064221 |  else will too double figures that is now for Foden this season for City 10 goals I've got uh I've
[8171.60 - 8175.68] P:1952.18 E:0.067236 |  got some quotes here Ben actually from Pep Guardiola on Phil Foden and interesting actually this is
[8175.68 - 8179.84] P:1797.82 E:0.063578 |  this is kind of the opposite of the discussion we've just had so having just watched that performance
[8179.84 - 8185.44] P:1937.35 E:0.061647 |  Pep has said this um he can get distracted easily he's still learning the rule he was out of position
[8185.44 - 8190.72] P:1986.31 E:0.058331 |  in the first half we know what huge talent he is but he's still young and he needs to learn
[8190.72 - 8194.56] P:1919.14 E:0.058797 |  now that's very interesting given what we've just discussed but I also think it's interesting that
[8194.56 - 8199.52] P:1931.33 E:0.060465 |  if Pep's willing to say that to the media he will have said that much more strongly
[8199.52 - 8205.12] P:1705.36 E:0.058147 |  to Foden himself at half time and he obviously reacted but that's a massive compliment isn't it
[8205.12 - 8209.52] P:1721.72 E:0.067852 |  the moment you see your manager's prepared to come out and say something like that off the back
[8209.52 - 8213.92] P:1743.99 E:0.066249 |  of a performance that was that good it almost implied there's a level I've just got to jump in
[8213.92 - 8217.36] P:1794.62 E:0.054774 |  because we've just heard some Pep quotes let's hear from the man himself he's with Jules
[8218.40 - 8223.60] P:1917.58 E:0.066721 |  hello Pep yes it is absolutely freezing um they're having a conversation the guys in the studio and
[8223.60 - 8227.92] P:1783.81 E:0.064075 |  the commentary team about Phil Foden we know what we can do you've spoken so much about him
[8228.48 - 8232.32] P:1921.84 E:0.056418 |  he belonged on that stage today didn't he his performance his composure
[8233.84 - 8238.40] P:1658.25 E:0.055486 |  yeah when playing the site when playing the mirror he was not in the position should be
[8239.12 - 8244.16] P:1723.37 E:0.048959 |  but this because he's young because it's special but of course in the when he played in the side
[8244.16 - 8251.04] P:1783.65 E:0.047662 |  the action for the second goal and the four was phenomenal you said in the past about him that
[8251.04 - 8255.52] P:1769.32 E:0.053362 |  you wanted him to develop at Manchester City there wasn't really that option to take him out on
[8255.52 - 8260.80] P:1901.33 E:0.061364 |  loan you wanted him to learn there how much more learning has he got to do because he just looks
[8260.80 - 8267.92] P:1716.98 E:0.048400 |  world-class at times Phil yes yeah we knew it from when I arrived here he has 16 years old
[8267.92 - 8274.64] P:1639.51 E:0.045714 |  Chiqui Bergrestine my sport my lovely sport director told me there is one guy you will love it I said
[8274.64 - 8280.32] P:1757.82 E:0.052120 |  okay take your time and after a while with 17 I think he came up to training and we saw something
[8280.32 - 8285.68] P:1752.07 E:0.053150 |  especially unique but he has to understand sometimes the game when playing inside and it's a little
[8285.68 - 8292.64] P:1670.18 E:0.048403 |  more time especially the tempo he always play in one tempo that is so good for the winger but in
[8292.64 - 8297.12] P:1686.13 E:0.059199 |  the middle has another tempo you have to make variations sometimes you have to play as slowly
[8297.12 - 8304.16] P:1717.69 E:0.041024 |  sometimes quicker and he's still not perfect on the sense and it's but with this joy to play with
[8304.16 - 8310.16] P:1875.76 E:0.050602 |  his ambition and his focus to learn he will get it how much do you drive him on because you speak
[8310.16 - 8315.52] P:1854.29 E:0.064790 |  to him so publicly in the media and maybe things that he could develop but privately how much do you
[8315.52 - 8321.84] P:1730.40 E:0.055476 |  drive him on talk to him and understand so we can talk and other times you realize when he can do it
[8321.84 - 8328.40] P:1751.06 E:0.043918 |  he can do it because the rest of the quality one against one the shoot is brilliant okay 14 wins in
[8328.40 - 8334.48] P:1731.98 E:0.052705 |  a row how much of a statement was that performance for our mind it's so good changing the Premier
[8334.48 - 8341.28] P:1707.78 E:0.051495 |  League like everyone you know how we struggle to win games everyone and but today I promise you
[8341.28 - 8346.88] P:1589.04 E:0.047174 |  we're going to celebrate it but tomorrow our feats will be on the grass again because in February
[8346.88 - 8354.08] P:1543.62 E:0.051001 |  no one is champion and and like I cannot predict the future all I can predict is work and work and
[8354.08 - 8359.92] P:1608.49 E:0.049860 |  work harder to to make a good game against Swansea and Tottenham but Pep you're winning and winning
[8360.72 - 8367.12] P:1724.66 E:0.058110 |  surely you are tightening that grip yeah but winning yeah of course I'm saying so I'm so grateful I
[8367.12 - 8372.88] P:1694.23 E:0.050377 |  I cannot more worse to to be grateful and thanks to these players but it's the past we have done
[8372.88 - 8379.20] P:1691.57 E:0.050950 |  brilliantly so I cannot deny it we're so happy but we are in February still we are in the second or
[8379.20 - 8384.72] P:1774.93 E:0.046474 |  third games on the second leg but for us for Manchester City especially you know three points
[8384.80 - 8388.96] P:1675.35 E:0.046385 |  but come here finally win it's important thank you very much for your time Pep thank you
[8389.76 - 8396.00] P:1936.13 E:0.058978 |  Pep Guardiola live on Premier League Sunday um so much of that I thought was fascinating Ben but
[8396.00 - 8400.00] P:1995.11 E:0.060599 |  that what he said about his lovely sporting director Chiki Burgistan you know we're talking
[8400.00 - 8404.96] P:2048.61 E:0.058681 |  about a guy there who Chiki Burgistan became a director at Barcelona a year before Lionel Messi
[8404.96 - 8412.00] P:1907.33 E:0.052005 |  broke through so he's seen a kid of that quality and Pep's there saying on his first day Phil Foden
[8412.00 - 8416.96] P:1928.35 E:0.055771 |  is the guy that Chiki Burgistan is telling him about Steve you're leading me down a dangerous path
[8416.96 - 8422.48] P:1956.08 E:0.069679 |  no no I'm not trying to I'm not trying to I'm not trying to do that I'm just saying he knows a player
[8422.48 - 8427.12] P:1791.56 E:0.064529 |  that's what I was going for absolutely yeah and I mean with a performance like that it's very difficult
[8427.12 - 8431.04] P:1837.54 E:0.062322 |  to argue with the idea that Phil Foden is not going to be a special special talent in a couple
[8431.04 - 8436.56] P:1757.77 E:0.060903 |  years time what we I was just saying directly before we went to Pep was I think that's such a
[8436.64 - 8442.48] P:1721.83 E:0.061727 |  compliment when he's prepared to come out and make bold statements like that about where Phil
[8442.48 - 8447.52] P:1832.24 E:0.067045 |  Foden needs to improve I don't think he would do that unless he felt Foden was a big enough character
[8447.52 - 8451.44] P:1908.21 E:0.071195 |  and a smart enough player to actually integrate those changes within his game and you get the
[8451.44 - 8455.92] P:1847.79 E:0.067416 |  impression it's it's probably times five times ten behind closed doors as well and probably a
[8455.92 - 8460.48] P:1789.03 E:0.062906 |  little bit more of a ruthless message but the fact that he's prepared to do it publicly publicly
[8460.48 - 8465.84] P:1808.73 E:0.055749 |  I think is massive at this stage in Foden's development it's also interestingly Leon that
[8466.00 - 8470.40] P:2032.94 E:0.061453 |  Pep Guardiola doesn't just kind of say that yes he was good but the team the team the team
[8470.40 - 8474.56] P:1859.38 E:0.059345 |  he's more than happy just to sort of stand there and kind of wax lyrical about a very special young
[8474.56 - 8479.76] P:1771.42 E:0.069122 |  man I think when you've got the individuals that he has got you know there are occasions when you
[8479.76 - 8484.64] P:1707.14 E:0.067790 |  have to come out and talk about their brilliance and you know today was a day for I'll try Gunda one
[8484.64 - 8489.04] P:1883.04 E:0.065762 |  it was a day for sorry Leon I'm doing it again it always seems to be you Jules has got Jurgen Klopp with
[8489.04 - 8495.04] P:1770.73 E:0.059716 |  her I almost have Jurgen Klopp with me the Liverpool manager he's about to make his way to
[8496.56 - 8503.60] P:1521.61 E:0.058552 |  hello can I what can you say Jurgen I can't hear you you know that I have to shout
[8503.60 - 8509.52] P:1685.13 E:0.070828 |  oh yeah is this social distancing okay here we go what what can you say Jurgen about about this afternoon
[8512.96 - 8519.12] P:1267.49 E:0.061482 |  so one thing is the result obviously absolutely rubbish for one losing for one in a game like this
[8519.12 - 8524.96] P:942.10 E:0.062519 |  is really exactly opposite of what we wanted the other thing is the performance and the performance
[8524.96 - 8530.88] P:889.78 E:0.055945 |  was in big parts of the game really really good at least level we've caused city a lot of problems
[8530.88 - 8534.00] P:805.36 E:0.067134 |  played a really good game and if you would have played more often this season like we played in
[8534.00 - 8540.72] P:703.13 E:0.060582 |  these parts we would not be 10 or 13 points behind city but that's all it's not important I think
[8541.44 - 8547.76] P:726.91 E:0.061480 |  first half at least level really good half top football both sides really interesting to watch
[8547.76 - 8555.92] P:929.22 E:0.055624 |  for both sides coming out for three four minutes I don't know exactly we are not that active as we
[8555.92 - 8565.76] P:783.00 E:0.054465 |  were before concede the goal in that it could be the offside goal maybe whatever concede the goal in
[8565.76 - 8573.76] P:862.92 E:0.055248 |  that in that period strike back score the equalizer and then it looked yeah could have gone our
[8573.76 - 8580.56] P:771.82 E:0.060612 |  direction and then we make two massive mistakes which obviously cost cost the game tonight and
[8581.12 - 8586.96] P:1298.16 E:0.069192 |  yeah that's how it is and that was so so uncharacteristic of allison as well I think for the second
[8586.96 - 8591.92] P:1484.28 E:0.068955 |  guard he got well I watched him he got a water bottle he just poured water over over his head as
[8591.92 - 8600.08] P:1076.12 E:0.062385 |  if to think what am I doing sort of thing that's live of professional sports people at you may
[8600.16 - 8604.32] P:756.08 E:0.065551 |  in that moment nobody thinks anymore about how good you are and stuff like this you're
[8604.32 - 8611.68] P:789.59 E:0.060068 |  how can that happen but we are so he saved our life plenty of times and tonight yeah of course he was
[8611.68 - 8617.68] P:878.50 E:0.064434 |  part of these two goals definitely so but we take that so we have this this game is gone so I saw a
[8617.68 - 8623.28] P:971.37 E:0.064610 |  lot of good things what I really liked and after we had to show a few things as a reaction as well
[8623.28 - 8627.28] P:855.54 E:0.066371 |  from the last game and the boys did the boys did that but then when you concede these goals they
[8627.28 - 8631.68] P:946.36 E:0.063034 |  obviously a mood killer it's not like who cares that strike back that's not these kind of goals
[8631.68 - 8639.28] P:939.50 E:0.059213 |  it's really good everybody was like my god okay that's really strange and so we lost the game now but
[8639.92 - 8644.08] P:1367.94 E:0.064514 |  we'll carry on they're just tough times aren't they? Liverpool's just going through a tough time
[8644.08 - 8648.40] P:1253.38 E:0.067335 |  sorry? Liverpool is just going through a tough time oh yes a tough time definitely it's a tough time
[8648.40 - 8656.08] P:795.13 E:0.058167 |  definitely but again we what I saw tonight this team will go again and that's all I need thank you
[8656.08 - 8661.84] P:1686.70 E:0.059806 |  very much Jürgen Jürgen Klopp live on Premier League Sunday there with with Juliet Farrington
[8661.84 - 8666.80] P:1884.56 E:0.056409 |  we've got Ben Haynes from 90 Million Leone Osmond and our correspondent John Murray with us on Premier
[8666.80 - 8672.08] P:1975.21 E:0.061952 |  League Sunday it's always interesting John to hear from Jürgen Klopp but I think sometimes a Sai says
[8672.08 - 8677.52] P:1949.71 E:0.055194 |  more than anything else yeah and listen he said there at the end this team will go again and I'm
[8677.52 - 8682.48] P:1971.88 E:0.063487 |  sure it will and as we talked earlier about the the important players that they're missing and the
[8682.48 - 8687.76] P:1946.96 E:0.063042 |  fact that they need to get the balance back in the team but in terms of the the title race this
[8687.76 - 8693.92] P:2039.22 E:0.066127 |  season I'm just looking at his notes Jürgen Klopp's notes in the in the match program today and he
[8693.92 - 8699.52] P:1918.09 E:0.064867 |  he's talking about the rivalry between Manchester City and and Liverpool and he says there have been

[8705.28 - 8712.24] P:1861.94 E:0.059610 |  punches but neither will go to the canvas in terms of this season's title race you can finish that
[8712.24 - 8720.16] P:1869.14 E:0.055373 |  analogy yourself yeah more like rocky five um Leone this the stats you know there's there's loads
[8720.16 - 8724.56] P:1911.70 E:0.061413 |  of them flying around but this is quite a good one I think 23 games into last season Liverpool
[8724.56 - 8731.68] P:1890.95 E:0.058103 |  were 19 points clear 23 games into this one they're 10 points behind and I know you know it's very
[8731.68 - 8735.68] P:1981.20 E:0.064414 |  easy the conversation could quite easily and you know reasonably go back to the injury to Virgil
[8735.76 - 8741.84] P:1842.65 E:0.055042 |  Bandai but that is an incredible climb down for Liverpool over the course of the season
[8743.12 - 8747.36] P:1814.80 E:0.068599 |  well of course it is you know there's no there's no getting away from that but you know we were
[8747.36 - 8754.72] P:1887.14 E:0.070691 |  treated to you know three incredible seasons of 98 99 and 100 points you know and suddenly we
[8755.52 - 8760.16] P:1925.45 E:0.069039 |  we forget that you know teams win the Premier League with three or four defeats okay Liverpool have
[8760.16 - 8765.60] P:1843.45 E:0.061174 |  have just in a bad run and had more than that but it was inevitable that the Premier League especially
[8765.60 - 8769.84] P:1854.57 E:0.069172 |  this season wasn't going to take 100 points to win it it's going to it's going to be more
[8769.84 - 8776.24] P:1838.33 E:0.060246 |  you know probably mid 80s maybe um so that was going to happen to to a side like Liverpool but
[8776.24 - 8780.08] P:1574.99 E:0.066731 |  you know I think the the way they've sort of lost their confidence and lost their way in the last
[8780.72 - 8785.20] P:1847.14 E:0.065568 |  month or so the fact that suddenly the most poked-and-striked force in certainly in the Premier
[8785.20 - 8790.00] P:1824.18 E:0.063888 |  League is struggling to find opportunities is you know it's something that nobody would have
[8790.00 - 8794.88] P:1835.55 E:0.062826 |  predicted you know the fact that Burnley and Brighton and now Manchester City have all gone
[8794.96 - 8800.00] P:1791.95 E:0.068193 |  to Anfield and won three games on the run after their incredible home run again no one would have
[8800.00 - 8805.84] P:1820.04 E:0.058712 |  predicted so you know Jurgen Klopp needs to find a way of somehow getting past this getting through
[8805.84 - 8811.76] P:1844.25 E:0.062672 |  it so getting confidence back within his side because you know I think it's more Liverpool's doing
[8811.76 - 8816.24] P:1723.99 E:0.066631 |  than other teams and even Manchester City I think Manchester City have been terrific but they've
[8816.24 - 8819.84] P:1774.20 E:0.067257 |  been Manchester City it's Liverpool who've fallen away and that's been the difference
[8820.80 - 8824.72] P:1695.18 E:0.074100 |  Steve you mentioned Jurgen Klopp's side there at the beginning of the interview
[8824.72 - 8828.40] P:1640.99 E:0.066267 |  do you know what's really interesting is I don't think I've ever heard him
[8828.40 - 8834.56] P:1707.96 E:0.057074 |  off the back of a defeat sort of just so sort of accepting of it just very flat very kind of
[8834.56 - 8839.20] P:1729.97 E:0.059593 |  you know we made a couple of big mistakes I've just been meeting four one at Anfield like I don't
[8839.20 - 8844.48] P:1835.18 E:0.067005 |  know why but I'm sort of expecting the Jurgen Klopp of a few weeks ago to come out sort of swinging
[8844.48 - 8849.60] P:1825.92 E:0.069422 |  there a little bit and making a fairly passionate defence of his side or explaining where things
[8849.60 - 8854.32] P:1813.36 E:0.058997 |  have gone wrong and it's sort of I mean perhaps that's that's credit to Man City maybe it's just
[8854.32 - 8860.32] P:1754.53 E:0.055139 |  the fact that Man City played that well in the second half um but for me I think if I was in
[8860.32 - 8865.44] P:1803.28 E:0.070364 |  his shoes I'd be seriously seriously annoyed with the fact that you work so hard to get back into the
[8865.44 - 8871.44] P:1797.75 E:0.061011 |  game and then two errors from one of your best players gives the game to Man City well Benny
[8871.44 - 8877.44] P:1792.36 E:0.067793 |  he also said you know that the two teams were very good in the first half I didn't agree with that I
[8877.44 - 8881.76] P:1757.38 E:0.071061 |  thought both teams were pretty pretty flat and pretty ordinary in the first half sort of weighing
[8881.76 - 8887.52] P:1784.86 E:0.066678 |  each other up and then he said that his team came out and were below their level at the start of the
[8887.52 - 8891.68] P:1780.03 E:0.065928 |  second half and Manchester City stole a lead on them and I think Manchester City just stepped it up
[8891.68 - 8895.52] P:1596.57 E:0.062622 |  a little bit I think you know I think that was the difference I think both teams were flat in the
[8895.52 - 8901.04] P:1645.32 E:0.066740 |  first half Man City stepped up the level the level and Liverpool didn't go with them and you know as
[8901.04 - 8905.36] P:1736.16 E:0.072647 |  you said then to get back in the game I mean even Jurgen Klopp was talking about offside goals within
[8905.36 - 8910.48] P:1714.92 E:0.060390 |  there they've just been beat 4-1 at home um you know you can see it's frustrated but you know his
[8910.48 - 8916.80] P:1811.17 E:0.067187 |  team are playing below par his goalkeeper is giving two howlers away in in a big huge game once they've
[8916.80 - 8922.08] P:1652.54 E:0.061621 |  got back level so something's clearly not right at Liverpool and Jurgen Klopp will be wanting to
[8922.08 - 8928.32] P:1724.92 E:0.058501 |  find out what it is as quick as he can 8 5 0 5 8 at 5 live sport Charlie says you wonder how much

[8938.40 - 8943.12] P:1924.97 E:0.065332 |  I'm not sure the question necessarily should be given where Manchester United are whether the
[8943.12 - 8948.08] P:1819.27 E:0.059585 |  title race is over the question Ben has got to be whether Liverpool's title race is over
[8949.60 - 8956.32] P:1805.85 E:0.068710 |  yeah I you don't want to write off Liverpool do you it feels at this stage it feels very naive to
[8956.32 - 8962.24] P:1703.18 E:0.064338 |  even suggest that Liverpool are out there is let alone some of the chat around top four I I just
[8962.24 - 8967.76] P:1619.09 E:0.063772 |  can't buy into it I can't get my head around the idea that we're considering that Liverpool won't be
[8967.76 - 8973.44] P:1651.61 E:0.067741 |  in the top four this season having said that the way that man City are playing it's really difficult to
[8973.44 - 8979.52] P:1765.43 E:0.060495 |  get to veer away from the idea of man City being in this robotic sort of fashion that they are at
[8979.52 - 8983.68] P:1853.36 E:0.071738 |  the moment man City are managing to share the goals around and share the big performances around
[8983.68 - 8988.24] P:1694.23 E:0.067604 |  their front six they're not relying on one player to go out and dig them out of a hole they're
[8988.24 - 8992.40] P:1846.10 E:0.073853 |  sharing the goals around everywhere and Pep Guardiola is making changes all over the pitch and people
[8992.40 - 8996.96] P:1693.14 E:0.073622 |  just slotting into the system as if they've been playing that way for for weeks even when they haven't
[8996.96 - 9001.20] P:1716.44 E:0.063701 |  been involved Liverpool are sort of the antithesis of that we keep talking about how much they're
[9001.20 - 9008.24] P:1689.81 E:0.065434 |  missing players so maybe their races run but it still feels just a little bit premature to write them off
[9008.24 - 9012.16] P:1745.54 E:0.060614 |  yeah I don't think it's time to write Liverpool off just as you said you know we you spoke about it
[9012.16 - 9017.52] P:1828.53 E:0.059656 |  yourself John in the commentary about you felt Liverpool had to win you know that's the case
[9017.52 - 9020.96] P:1782.67 E:0.077524 |  there's so many games left in the season at the start of the season Liverpool had a good start
[9020.96 - 9025.84] P:1732.10 E:0.064356 |  Manchester City were probably roughly about 10 points behind Liverpool and you know that's changed
[9025.84 - 9030.48] P:1741.07 E:0.064116 |  around to such the extent it has within the season so there's enough games left it's just that
[9030.48 - 9036.24] P:1658.48 E:0.061010 |  Manchester City's form just looks so I'm gonna sit the moment doesn't it thank you very I'll go on
[9036.24 - 9041.68] P:1775.10 E:0.070858 |  John sorry yeah just I'm actually listening to Pep Guardiola at the moment as well in in one year

[9046.56 - 9053.04] P:1683.74 E:0.056017 |  penalty taker right and and Guardiola says when I mentioned that after the match today he said
[9053.04 - 9060.88] P:1796.50 E:0.050115 |  it's now a half joke he said when I mentioned it six months ago as he did it was a joke but he says
[9060.88 - 9067.20] P:1802.77 E:0.058026 |  now it's a half joke because they don't really have a specialist in this area he says so so we
[9067.20 - 9073.76] P:1833.04 E:0.055999 |  might so we might say because they've missed they've now missed they've missed uh they've scored four
[9073.84 - 9080.88] P:1757.97 E:0.053919 |  out of seven this season penalties and that's after missing six last season in all competitions
[9080.88 - 9087.92] P:1846.15 E:0.059246 |  so watch that space we will only a half joke now uh John not John Murray thank you very much to
