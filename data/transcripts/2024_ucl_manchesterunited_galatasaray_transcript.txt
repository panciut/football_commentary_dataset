 All about the special nights in the Champions League, because this is the 25th appearance in the group stages, the most of any English side, and only three behind Real Madrid and Barcelona, and that record of 28 appearances. So the Slovakian referee is about to get underway, but straight away it would look like they are going to play with three at the back, because Karn Ihan is the central figure of Padukka and Davison Sanchez, and indeed the ball goes straight to him, and he hits the ball flat and downfield, as Galatasaray, all in white, are playing from right to left. And did you bring the paracetamol with you? Because those Galatasaray supporters are bouncing up and down in unison towards our right. We won't be lacking in atmosphere tonight. One of the most atmospheric countries you're ever likely to visit for Champions League football. We went to the old stadium, the intimidating Alessane Ien, that was over 20 years ago, they got rid of that in 2010. The Sigtaches in Anu Stadium on the banks of the Bosphorus, boy, they create a real racket as well. So Manchester United's symbols certainly not having easy when they go to at West Anvil for the return game later on in this schedule, and that's why they've got to take advantage of this whole fixture here tonight. Darlo to Fernandez, little layoff, there was a pediatra, just lifts it forward, headed on by Terera, and it comes to Zaha, just showed too much towards Casamiro, who swept them all the way downfield, Hoyland. Hoyland skips away from the challenge of Buoy, and it's used to get away from the Frenchman, took back a little bit, still keeps on going, Hoyland, does well with the cross and the stabbed effort by Fernandez, his why. But that was much better from Manchester United. Has to score, captain Bruno Fernandez has to score this ball across from Hoyland, and he's just tried to be too precise with his finish, and he's opened his foot, the angle on his foot too wide, and it's gone wide at the post, but excellent start by Manchester United and Hoyland in particular. Yes, it was on that left-hand side. They lacked quality in the final third against Crystal Palace at the weekend, although when they did come forward, they were met with a real resilient Crystal Palace side, with Gehi and Anderson in particular outstanding at the back for Roy Hoggson's side. On Saturday, Stortport won, Forrest Green-Neal, Bolton Wanderers are leading in League One at home to Stevenage by a goal to Neal, Oxford United won, Shrews Green-Neal is the latest score, Oxford who are second in League One. But Eriksen Haag, well they wanted a positive start, and they've got a good tempo so far. Yeah, you can already see the intensity, the flow, the space for Fernandez. Hannibal to Fernandez, he looked for the cross on the right-hand side, blocked by Angelinho, comes back towards Fernandez, waits to deliver, doesn't do so, then works over the cross, and then it was cleared away by Terera. It was the Rabona cross from the right-hand side by Fernandez, but it didn't fox the Galatasaray defence, however, it's been a start full of purpose. Absolutely, the fluidity across the Manchester United midfield and forwards. It was actually Bruno Fernandez finding himself on this sort of right-wing position, with Hannibal more central, will probably see those two rotating throughout the game, just to cause Angelinho an issue that left back for Galatasaray. He talks about the one change that is made, Hannibal coming in for Pallestra because of the energy that he can provide. Probably at this stage he's unable to play three games in a week, the Tunisian international, but he's certainly recognisable, with his mop of hair as he's waiting for Galatasaray to take a throw on that right-hand side. Okan Burak is the coach of Galatasaray. He was actually in charge of Istanbul, Basakşehir, when they beat Manchester United in Istanbul in November 2020. Covered that game, the defending that night from Manchester United was dreadful, and even Burak was shocked himself at some of the defending. It was Kamikaze stuff from Oleg Anasaltzi aside. They certainly will not be able to afford Galatasaray another such luxury, with the players that they possess in attack going forward. Now is Amrabat coming forward from his left back roll, a little bit unfamiliar, but he's played there now for what? This is his third game, and he's delighted Ten Haag with his commitment and his professionalism, but they've lost the ball and it goes back Angelinho all the way to the goalkeeper, Muslera. Downfield, unchallenged header by Casanero, lifted forward by Mason Mount. I think Fernandez thought he was coming back from an offside position, but Badak Ture had just dropped back a little bit deeper. He was actually on side. In fact, I said at the start that they might have gone with three at the back. That was just for the kick-off. Ayan is actually sitting, isn't he, in that holding roll? I've actually watched that in this opening five minutes. Dunno, and they're just changing between a back four and a back three. We're also live on BBC Radio Manchester tonight here at Old Trafford, as well as BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds, the live sport after the excellent coverage that the lads out in Rome provided, and Catherine of course, lads and lasses out in Rome for the Ryder Cup. We've got the Champions League tomorrow night, we're at St James's Park, which will be absolutely crackling Newcastle United against Paris Saint-Germain. And then we've got the Cricket World Cup, that begins on Thursday morning. That's on Sports Extra around 9.30. England against New Zealand, and of course the Rugby Union World Cup is still ongoing out in France and Friday night, France against Italy. And then on Saturday, Burnley Chelsea, myself and Izzy together for that one. England Samoa to follow, Crystal Palace, Nottingham Forest, the second half, and then that crucial game, Ireland against Scotland from eight o'clock. So still so much live sport to look forward to on BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Live Sport over the coming days and weeks. Cheltenham Nill Fleetwood 1 is the latest scorer in League 1. And after that, little flurry of activity at the start, just seems to have settled down a fraction, Nill Nill here at Old Trafford, six minutes played. Yeah, I need a breather after that opening exchange, trying to figure out how Galatasaray are going to play. I think I've figured it out that they're playing player for player against Manchester United, which I actually think will work in Manchester United's favour. Angelinho looks for the run of Zaha, being tracked by Darlo. Darlo holds him off. Now it's with Hannibal, he did well, showed his strength. Casamira now takes it on, calling his way through the midfield. His forward ball takes an inflection, won't quite reach, Mason Mount over on that far side. Nassau are surprised about all the headlines about Zaha's return to Old Trafford. It's not like he's never played here before. Yes, he was a former Manchester United player, but it was a decade ago. I think he's proven himself since. And this is his seventh appearance at Old Trafford, for the former Manchester United player. As Amrabat swings over the cross, now it's played forward. Casamira wins it back, Fernandez towards Hoiland. The return ball to Fernandez, the United captain, out to Amrabat, has stayed out wide, early cross, cut out by Buoy. Buoy now will clear. Only as far as Casamira lifts it up into the air. Darlo joins the attack, Angelinho is in front of him, former Manchester City player, shifts it on the outside, Angelinho slides into the challenge. He's appealing for a goal kick, but it's a corner kick to Manchester United. I think he's got a bit of a shout, Angelinho. But tell you what, he is one hell of a 1v1 defender, and you can just see in this situation, watching on the replay, it's just Darlo in a 1v1 with Angelinho on this right-hand side for Manchester United. Well, Fernandez, the Manchester United captain, to hoots of derision from the Galatasaray supporters, has come across to take the corner kick on this near side to right. And it's pulled out towards Hannibal, closed down, and the break is on. And it's with Akta Koluk, who's making a strong run through the middle, he's running at the heart of the United defence, he tries to go it alone, and in the end it's Darlo, who takes it away off his toes. Incidentally, by the way, when that corner was taken, there's been a high netting that has been erected with black stanchions in front of the Galatasaray supporters. That's certainly a change since I was here at the weekend, and yet a still, an object was thrown from the Turkish support when Fernandez wait to take the corner kick on this right-hand side. I can still see it just ahead of the quadrant, down towards the right. So it was erected, and with good reason too. Nine minutes play, 0-0. Decent break, wasn't it for Galatasaray? That's what United have got to be wary about. It was, and actually Tete was in. But Akta Koluk didn't see his run, but he was in. Somebody who they signed from the third tier of Turkish football, but he's progressed all the way now, and not just with Galatasaray, but onto the international stage as well. 22 caps for his country, Kerem Akta Koluk, 24 years of age, contributed four goals in 14 appearances, fourth season at the club, had actually been involved with 12 goals, as they've made a very good start and beaten so far this season when you consider he's got eight assists to his credit as well. Stevenage have equalised at Bolton. It's Bolton won, Stevenage won as the latest scorer in League One, Charlton, Neal, Exeter won, and Portsmouth, the leaders of League One, who were actually unbeaten in something like 21 games, are behind at Fratton Park to Wiccan Wanderers by a goal to nil. Lindelof forced a turn, down towards that far side. Galatasaray all in white, attacking the strep for then, playing from right to left, 10 minutes in. The defending line on 59-tip, and that will be a goal kick. Things have just settled down a little bit. Lindelof does really well, Casimiro doubling up, just seeing them doing a high five of appreciation for each other. Classic defensive midfielder role, putting out fires from Casimiro. The voice of Izzy Christensen, the former England international. As now it's with Bruna Fernandez in the centre circle, runs away off the shins of Ihan. Hannibal plays it forward, Hoylan makes the run, coming across his production with a ponytail, shows his strength, and then with a back pass to Miss Laira, all in green, clears it away long over the head of Zarar, out of play, goes for a throw. How have Arsenal started in France? Alistair Vrussbaugh. I would say they're yet to fully settle, just shy of 10 minutes played. It's longs nil, Arsenal nil, being played in a very boisterous atmosphere. Longs have been more on the front foot, one a couple of corners, created the first half chance centre-back Kevin Danso, shooting wide. Longs nil, Arsenal nil. Burning of City without a win in five, and now leading Huddersfield town by two goals to nil at St Andrews in the championship. Bristol Robersley, Port Vale by a goal to nil. Miss Tramlia Rovers won Bradford City nil. Mark Hughes is a manager under pressure of Bradford City in league two, 11 minutes played and they're behind at Brenton Park. Galatasaray here at Manchester United, still nil nil on BBC Radio 5 Live. The sunchests formally have topped them, flokes it forward, Bowie heads it on, Tete will give chase, but that will be picked up by Onana. He was extremely impressive last season, 13 clean sheets in the Champions League, that was the most of any goalkeeper. How he could do with another, he's only kept three in his nine games so far, all in yellow. The Cameroon International clears it away downfield, but has he highlighted Angelinho, and he was watchful to put the ball out of play for a throw. Yeah, he's done well, marshalling Bruno Fernandez, who is staying out. On this right-hand side, in these opening three minutes, from Manchester United, just playing on the shoulder, playing on the line, as is Rashford on the opposite side, just trying to stretch the Galatasaray defence. Ball goes back to Onana. It was Iqari putting him in pressure, pressing from the other front, given away by Varan, won back by Darlo, he was quite high at the pitch on this near side, the right. Hannibal now feeds it inside towards Fernandez, but there was Brodaça, just read it very, very well, the 29-year-old. Only a couple of caps for Turkey, and in fact, they were both in there in June, but it was excellent reading as the ball goes back and the Slera clears it long, first-time right foot of the way downfield. Amrabat will like to get forward, he'll roam inside from that left-back roll, and it was his header off his bald head that is collected, though, by Galatasaray, Davison Sanchez. Don Castellip Crawley by Goulton Hill in league two. Hannibal lays it off, Casamiro slices the ball forward, and then it's with Galatasaray, Bué brings it under control, a cushion touch, a carding with a little layoff back onto the halfway line, now with Terera, interception though from Hoyland, early ball from Casamiro, Bruna Fernandez now has it, floats the ball out towards Rashford, hardly seen anything of Rashford, 13 minutes into this game, but now left-hand side of the penalty area, Mount makes the run ahead in, tries the cut back, and it's cleared away by Karn, Ihan. United get it back once again, not holding onto the ball at the moment, Galatasaray very well, Casamiro steps forward, scoops it towards Hannibal, Flag stays down, Hannibal's first touch, it was always going away from him, he's kept the ball alive and in play, plays it back, Rashford, left-hand side from Manchester United, in towards Hannibal once again, down towards the bioline, Sanchez closes him down, corner kick to Manchester United. Yeah, excellent passage of play from Manchester United, it's Hannibal making the forward run, it was Mason Mount moments earlier, both getting into that bioline position, looking for the cut back, both deflected, but really good intent from Manchester United going forwards. So Manchester United in their red shirts and black shorts, playing from left to right, have the corner on the left-hand side, it's taken short, Mount then to Rashford, back out it goes to Bruna Fernandez, Fernandez waits to deliver the cross, it's an in-swinging ball, Moslera punches the ball away, collected by Darlo, just outside the centre-circle, back out towards Hannibal on the right, Hannibal now sends over the cross, that was headed out by Ahan, now towards Zaha, Zaha didn't have much support, but Aksa Ulu tries to carry it forward, Casemiro snuffed out of his threat, but it goes in favour of Galatasaray for a throw. Using all of his Champions League experience, Casemiro putting out the fire again, as I said earlier, just sweeping up the transition off the corner, relieving any pressure that Galatasaray getting a little bit of a sniff, as Manchester United's attacking set pieces break down. He made his Champions League debut actually against Galatasaray in November 2013 for Real Madrid, five Champions League names, of course, to his long list of major honours in his illustrious career for the Brazilian international. There's been a goal in longs, Alistair Broussbal. Arsenal have certainly settled now, they lead by a goal to nil, gifted it really, longs given the ball away inside their own half, but Kaio Saka immediately spotted Gabriel J. Zouce to his left, nice touch to work it onto his right foot, and he drilled the shot into the bottom corner, longs, then Arsenal won. Manchester United are attacking with Mount out towards Rashford, Rashford on that left-hand side, cuts in field, can't get a sight of goal, back towards Amrabat, toe into the ball out towards Hannibal, Darlo decides to come forward as well, so Arsenal looking to build on that excellent opening win against PSV on matchday one, Manchester United, they've got some work to do after that defeat in Munich to Bayern, crew one, Jillingham Nill is the latest scoring lead, two, and in the championship, West Brom and Chalvin lead Sheffield Wednesday by a goal to nil, West Brom unbeaten in four, Sheffield Wednesday still without a win, struggling in the championship, just two points after their opening, nine games. 16 minutes played, nil-nil. The slayer to Badaccia. Badaccia is complaining that there was no out ball on this near side to left, because Angelinho had gone in field in that inverted role, and Zaha was the one who had to come short. It's called fashion deno, full-back going inside. Have you ever done it? I thought you would ask me about fashion. It's going to save, you've never seen my attire. Ball over the top towards Rashford, flag stays down, I thought Rashford was coming back from an offside position, Rashford now with a cross, and the header in by Hoiland, and the flag stays down, and Hoiland has scored his first goal at Old Trafford, and Manchester United lead by a goal to nil, swift counter-attack by Manchester United, Rashford did ever so well, and Hoiland with a header gives United a lead. Easy as anything for Manchester United to get over the top of Galatasaray, but I tell you what, Marcus Rashford in that position. I've had questions, can he add assist to his game? Can he add more goals? And this assist for Hoiland is absolutely marvellous, ruthless, precise. The header was just exquisite, and you can just see on the replay, Marcus Rashford all alone, no-one marking him tight. There's a VAR check, that was why the booze and the groans. I thought, to my natural, I thought he was coming back from an offside position at the time. Said it in the commentary, but looking at it again, Sanchez might just have been playing him onside. Well, he had a check, and the goal stands, and Manchester United do lead by a goal to nil. And there's been a goal elsewhere in the Premier League, and it's the Kenilworth road, Chris Coles. What an important goal this could be for Burnley, who have a first half stoppage time, lead over Luton, Lyle Foster back from suspension, back with a big goal for his team, clean through, shrugged off Tom Lockyer, and slid under Thomas Kaminski to make it Luton nil, Burnley won. Burnley, who are yet to win this season, just one point. I think Terere is still complaining. He might have spoken a little bit out of turn, then, to the Slovakian referee, but Euland, after 17 minutes, has given the lead. It was a quick check, but I think Sanchez was probably looking at it again, playing him onside. We don't want to talk about tight VAO calls, then, eh? Well, it was probably about another 30-odd seconds, as it was at Tottenham, but... ...Voiland, who scored against Bayern, still yet to score in the Premier League, but his first goal at Old Trafford, as Zaha is just having a little bit of a... ..of a niggle with Hannibal, just a little push in the chest of Hannibal, and the referee telling him to cut it out. That was a strong challenge on Sanchez, on Mason Mount, good old 50-50, and it goes to that far side. Rashford, then, with the assist, picks the ball up, keeps the ball in play on that left-hand side. The cross goes in, and Mislare claims it high, just above his head, away towards our right. That should settle any anxieties for Manchester United, do you think? It's definitely settled them, but it's also kicked them again. They really want another goal. You could just see, after winning that free kick moments earlier, Casamira has gone for the quick one, straight into Mason Mount. The referee has actually pulled it back, but that just gives you an indication of what Manchester United are planning here. They want that second. Ball goes back to Mislare. They've never won in England in all of their previous ten trips to this country. They've drawn three and lost seven, and Galatasaray find themselves behind in this gaming group A in the Champions League. Arsenal are leading in France by a goal to nil, and it's half-time now in the Premier League. Chris Coles. Plus half of football. Proper harem, scaram stuff. Luton nil, Burnley won. The list of chances lengthy for both. Lyle Foster finally taking one for the visitors in first half-stoppage time. Good finish. Jadossi Ogbeni, heading Luton's best chance just wide. Luton nil, Burnley won. Newport nil, Colchester won. Cambridge nil, Barnsley two, a latest scores in the Football League. Forward ball to Hoiland. Mislare is out of his penalty area, and just about gets the touch from his feet, and takes it the other side of Hoiland, who'd made the run to the left of the keeper. The ball went to the right, and then, I think it was Badaccia, who gave it back to the keeper. He'd only just got back to his speed, he didn't. Well, it was like a hot potato. I'll tell you what, that ball through with the outside of his foot from Mason Mow, was exceptional. The run from Hoiland, just playing on the back line, it's been a feature in the game so far. Hoiland just on the back shoulder of Davison Sanchez. The ball fed on the angle into Hoiland, and he was inches away from Tone, it passed the goalkeeper, and he would have had an empty net to slot it into. Napoli are leading Real Madrid by a goal to nil in Group C. Earlier in the early a-kick game, in fact, at Union Berlin, who would 2-0 up and home to Sporting Braga, ended up losing that 3-2 to the Portuguese side, and in the other earlier game in Group D, Salzburg nil, Real Sausage had 2. So, Real Sausage had go to four points, Inter and Benfica in San Siro, currently drawing 0-0. This is BBC Radio 5 Live, and BBC Sounds were also live on Radio Manchester. Stopport 2, Forrest Green nil, Knox County knee leads Swindon now by 2 goals to nil, also in League 2, as Ihan clears the ball away, high downfield, and then Lindelof will wait for that bouncing ball just to drop towards him, and then he heads it back to Onana. And the underarm throw out to Viran, Casamiro. Fullbacks are pushed on, aren't they, for Manchester United? The ball cleared long by Onana, Hannibal heads it on, looking towards Hoiland, Sanchez with a back pass. Hoiland continues to run to Mislera, the Uruguayan keeper, finds Angelinho, and now it's with Badaccia. Angelinho takes over for Galatasaray, who, unbeaten since the end of April, when they lost to Besiktas, the Turkish champions, the ball is hit long by Devison Sanchez up towards Zaha. Zaha uses strength down into the ground, and Zaha is equalised. Manchester United never dealt with a threat of Wilfred Zaha, and he's scored an ultrapan against his former club, right-footed, over the despairing dive of Onana. Galatasaray with the equaliser, Wilfred Zaha making his mark, 1-1. Well, it's been all Manchester United, but I tell you what, this is really poor defending from Diogo Dallo. The ball is bouncing, and it's just sheer strength. Zaha just holds him off and allows the ball to keep bouncing into the box, and Onana is nowhere to be seen inside the Manchester United goal. Zaha has just flicked a leg at it, the ball is bounced off the floor, over the top of Onana, he's got no chance, because it's actually deflected off Dallo. And it's gone into the back of the net completely against the run of play. Should Dallo have been stronger in that instance? Absolutely, I'm just watching the replay. Zaha is leaning into him, Dallo is leaning into him as well, but it's just this little touch, he gets a touch on it, and Zaha kind of, scissor kicks it on the half-move, on the half-turn, sorry. And Dallo just can't deal with the sheer strength of Zaha. I would say it's a good finish, but it's not really, it's just deflected over the top of Onana, but the goal is just pure endeavour. And Zaha, who once scored two goals in a win for Crystal Palace here, in 2020, it was a 3-1 success for Crystal Palace, that means that it's three goals in seven at Adol Trafford. But he scored and he's first start at the weekend against Ankara, he's scored in successive games, and the word bedlam springs to mind when I look away towards that ride and that travelling support of Galatasaray and that quadrant as Tete runs forward, and really out of nothing, Galatasaray have levelled that Sanchez ball out of defence, Zaha's onto it, never dealt with it, Manchester United. And these are the moments now, Deno, where I have big questions over this Manchester United team, not because of the personnel, but just the mentality, and how can they manage this now, they were in full control up until a couple of minutes ago, how do they react? Well, 1-1 Arsenal, remember a leading against Lawns via a goal to Niel, Copenhagen and Bayern, which is also in Manchester United's group, Groupay, that is Niel Niel. I think I'm right in saying that last year Copenhagen drew every game at home, including against Manchester City, they're a tough side to play against on their own soil in Denmark, and also in Arsenal's group in Group B, it's still no goals in Eindhoven, and the Phillips Stadio in between PSV and Sevilla. Knox County have got a third goal at home to Swindon, that's 3-0, Grimsby lead Barrow by a goal to Niel, Northampton 2, Redding Niel is a latest score in League 1. 1-1 here in our commentary game, Adol Trafford, the ball spread out and intercepted from Dallow, Casamiro looks to hit it early towards Bruno Fernandez, Angelino will tie it back, and then all the way to Mislera, and he clears it away. I thought he was in, Casamiro, ball around the corner, straight in between Angelino and a centre-back for the run of Bruno Fernandez going for, and I actually thought he was in, but it was exceptional defending again from Angelino. The thing is, when you look at Manchester United, essentially they are a counter-attacking side. If teams sit off, they struggle to break teams down, and the way that Bruno Fernandez is playing quite high up on this right-hand side, they're looking for that early ball for the run of their captain, aren't they? Absolutely. Not just Bruno Fernandez, Rashford and Hoyland as well. Here is Rashford, stopped by the run of Bué, referee's played the advantage, Casamiro, shot takes an inflection, and just goes wide. That could have gone anywhere, because Mislera was stranded. He watched him almost despair as he looked towards his left, wondering where that ball was going to drop to. There's been another goal in Lans, Alastair Bruce Ball. It's an equaliser for the home team, Lanswain Arsenal, one young Frenchman, Adrien Thomason, finishing quite brilliantly after the centre-forward, L.E.A.Y., he chested down and acrobatically flicked it across to him, and then Thomason with his right foot, just guiding the ball on the bounce past the outstretched hand of David Rea. Lanswain Arsenal, one. Thank you, Ali. 1-1 in the commentary game here at Old Trafford, Manchester United have a... Corner kick, right-hand side, Bruno Fernandez with the out-swinger, attacked by Sanchez, must have gone out and come back in. The referee's blown his whistle, and it will be a goal kick to Galatasaray. So, Okamburak side, a back level. Manchester United, there will be an element of frustration on that bench of Eric Tenhargik, is he Christensen? Yeah, absolutely, this has been a familiar feeling here at Old Trafford this season. Across Manchester United that they've been shocked, they think they've started the game right, and they had, but they've just been shocked, and that is a reminder that push for that second goal, especially in Champions League, is so important. The rain has returned here in Manchester, as the ball is headed away by Davison Sanchez, 9.5 million Euro signed from Tottenham, after he had just started his seventh season in London, just over 200 appearances that he made for Tottenham Hotspur. There's Lindelof to Casamiro, who turns, he's put that ball, he's going to be fouled there for a free kick, it was a challenge coming in from Tesse, 14 appearances he made for Leicester last season, five players who played in the Premier League in the Galatasaray, starting 11. 1-1, as it is in France between Lons and Arsenal. Now, to Renshel Reign, driving down as a squinting Casamiro, pulls that ball out of play for a throw, so it's a throw to Galatasaray. Ipswich were leading Hull City by a goal to Nill, but there's been another goal at Portman Road, Aaron Paul. Ipswich 2, Hull City 0, it's another stunning strike from Kieran McEnany's side, ball played from left to right, and there is Connor Chaplin just inside the D to curl past the goalkeeper into the top corner of the net. Ipswich 2, Hull City now. But by the end of Hull City's eight-match unbeaten run, and it would take Ipswich to the top tonight, if it was to stay like that, cross swung over from Angelinho, cleared away by Casamiro, round the trigger, equalised in Naples, Napoli won, round the dribb one, here is Hoyland, who gave United the lead, got to go it alone, holds onto the ball very well, he was met by three White Shirts, excellent play by Hoyland, met by stronger pause to Rashford, Amrabat makes the run ahead of him, Amrabat back towards Mason, down into the ground, took a deflection behind for a corner kick, much better again by Manchester United. Yeah, Hoyland, absolutely fantastic hold-up play, centre-forward play, overlapping full-back in Amrabat in that position, and it was Mount who was there for the cut-back, he failed to get a clean connection on the finish, exceptional play from Hoyland in particular. It was Badaccia who got that telling deflection for a corner kick, far side the left. Fernandez pulls it out towards Rashford, Rashford makes a run in towards the penalty area, the angle is tight, the ball won't go with it, Terreira is the player who can clear it for Galatasaray, Amrabat then slips and he was fouled by Tete, and that'll be a free kick, he's got to be careful for persistent defending, Tete. Yeah, he's a lucky boy, Amrabat. Galatasaray had broken, they had three players around the ball, and Amrabat I think he actually slipped and it looked like he'd been fouled, haven't seen a replay. Galatasaray would have been in then, Tete, yeah, he does hack him down actually. Well, Casemiro this occasion is the... It goes in favour of Casemiro actually, Iqadi pleads his innocence, but he's fouled the Brazilian as he slid into that challenge, so it's a free kick which has been taken. Manchester United, you've just joined us here on Five Live, and BBC sounds have been pegged back by Wilfred Zaha. We've got 15 minutes to go to halftime. Bruno Fernandez is now occupying a position on that far side, the left. He rolls the ball in towards Rashford, lets it run through to Hoyland. Angelinho was tucked in to clear the ball away, good covering from the left back. Dallow now for Manchester United. Zaha gets a block challenge in and it runs out of play for a throw. Dallow wants to take it quickly. Back it goes to Verran. Here is Verran outside the centre-circle, along the ground, Mason mounts, side onto goal, forward ball, layoff by Bruno Fernandez. Torreira tries to win it, momentarily had it, and Torreira's going to get a yellow card for the Slovakian referee for a foul on Casemiro. It's a foul from Torreira, but I tell you what, it's lazy from Bruno Fernandez. Just flicking the ball in central areas, it's such a risk in that area, because Amrabat is the left back from Manchester United, he's coming in field, the space is wide open, and that is such a dangerous area to leave vacant. And you're flicking the ball around centrally, you have to be firm with the passes. Well, you heard the reaction of a supporter in the directors box, who's seen that on the replay. He's going in with his stud showing, isn't he, Torreira? He is. It's lower than what we saw at the weekend, with Curtis Jones, there's less contact on Casemiro. But in the replay, it doesn't look too great, but he's got a yellow card. Yeah, Curtis Jones Liverpool lost that appeal, incidentally, it was an unsuccessful... Curtis Jones had gone over the top of the ball, he hasn't gone over the top of the ball, but he has gone in with his stud showing, and Casemiro's getting treatment, so there's... I mean, VAR would naturally have a look at it, but there's no indication at the moment, so whether that was a check complete, we could only assume so, as it's 1-1 with 13 minutes to go at a half-time. Arsenal have been pegged back, like Manchester United have as well. A reminder tomorrow, commentary. Chris Waddle joining John Murray at St James' Park for what should be a terrific atmosphere for Newcastle United against Paris-Hasimov. And then at the weekend, Burnley Chelsea, second half of Crystal Palace, Nottingham Forest, and then on Sunday, Brighton, Liverpool, and Arsenal Manchester City are our two commentaries on Sunday. Casemiro is back on the field of play, and now there was a blow to the head of Bouet, so that'll be another stoppage of free-kick to Gallatay-Tatharai. And we'll go back and find out how Arsenal are doing in Group B. Alistair Bruceport. 13 minutes left in the first half. Lance won Arsenal won. They kind of gifted each other goals. Arsenal took the lead, Bakai Osaka was played the ball by a Lance player inside the Lance half. He fed Gabriel J. Zoussen, he scored, and then David Rea playing out from the back gave the ball away, and it was Adrian Tomasson who finished it off for Lance. Lance won Arsenal won. Merci, Ali, Charlton won, Exeter won, is a latest score in League One. There's been another goal scored on the stroke of halftime in League One. Bristol Roe has got a second at home to Port Vale, so they're 2-0 up, and there are no other goals to tell you about, as the halftime whistles are sounding elsewhere on a busy night in the EFL as a production with a foul, and that'll be a free-kick to Manchester United with about 11 minutes to go of normal time in this first half, just one-one on five-life. Yeah, he would play by Hannibal, just pinning Badaccia. The ball's gone forward into his chest, he just showed real strength to hold him off, get inside a free-kick, work it out again, Manchester United. Amrabat knew that Casamiro, dropping in between the two central defenders, his forward ball is headed away by Sanchez, and then Casamiro's shown a yellow card for a challenge on Axa Conley. Casamiro loose bouncing ball, he's just gone in with speed, with his foot up. Dangerous play. Badaccia takes it, spreads it out towards that far side, that was a precise pass out towards the right, Buoy. Tete now takes over, dropping back midway through the Manchester United half. Sanchez's forward ball, and then Buoy's ball is a little bit too far ahead of the midfielder for Galatasaray. So a Manchester United throw, midway through the half, over on that far side. They're left 10 minutes to go to half-time here, it's one-one. Alistair Bruce-Ball watching Arsenal. Another blow for Arsenal, because Saka's only managed just over half an hour, he's gone off to be replaced by Fabio Villera, seem to be holding the top of his right leg, not the same. I think there's a foot injury that took him off late on against Bournemouth at the weekend, they're obviously playing Manchester City this weekend, our commentary game on Sunday, but Saka off, just after the half-hour mark in this game, launched one Arsenal one. So a concern for Arsenal, and also I would imagine for Gareth Southgate, who names his England squad on Thursday as well, for the fitness concerns of Bacchio Saka. One-one here in Old Trafford, we've got less than 10 minutes to go to half-time. Fernandez finds Lindelof, steps forward out of defence, just outside the centre-circle of his own half. Casamiro under pressure, Akta Colu was sniffing around, out towards Rashford. He waits, closed down by Tete, out of play, it goes for a Manchester United throw. Yeah, I'm just looking at Manchester United's set-up, they look so vulnerable when they're playing with the ball centrally in tight areas, because they've committed Amrabat central, so they've almost got four midfielders playing in the mid, middle of the pitch, the space is so vacant, and it's teasing Galatasaray into the transitions. They've got to be sharper, Manchester United. Real Madrid are now in front in Naples, and Jude Bellingham has scored. What a season he is having since that move to Real Madrid. Napoli won, Real Madrid 2 is a latest score in the Champions League. And here we have nine minutes to go to half-time. Half-time now at Port Monroe in the championship, Aaron Paul. Ipswich 2, Halnell, two quality strikes, either end of the half from Wes Burns and Conor Chaplin. Have Ipswich down top of the championship as things stand? Half-time, Ipswich 2, Halnell. Bruna Fernandez looking for the run of Rashford. There they go on the counterattack once again. Bué holds off Rashford on that far side of the left, level of the penalty area. Bué, who'd been linked with Arsenal, and Brighton and Hove Albion. Back it goes to Fernandez, closed down by Terera, loops a long way up high into the air, drops bouncing ball, but actually waits for it to settle, touches it back to Angelinho, who then along the ground looks towards Zaha, who got the equaliser. Dallo with a sliding challenge. The Ocan Bueruk, the coach, is... ...pleading with the fourth official to show a yellow card. He's going to get it, Dallo. Quite rightly, so is Ocan Bueruk for his actions, because that pressure is something that the officials do not want to see from either a player or indeed a manager. Yeah, we don't want to see that, but it's happened right in front of his technical area. The tackle from Dallo on Zaha. Zaha's really clever. The ball is shaped down the line with Angelinho's left foot, and Zaha has just got himself in between Dallo and the ball, and he's gone to spin him behind, and Dallo has just cleaned him up into Ten Hargs technical area and forced the reaction from his manager, rightly so, but we don't want to see that at all. Message will be quite clear now for Zaha just to keep running at Dallo. He's on depression now on a yellow, isn't he? He is. He's been quiet, Zaha, but when he has come into life... Here is Rashford. Rashford's strong running on the left-hand side, and Zaha's in in low, but that's just as clear as far as Amra bat. Low ball. Fernandez was following it in, but the goalkeeper wasn't going to let that one loose, and he snaffled it up and then threw it out towards Angelinho. He likes to get forward on this near side. 15 appearances in his time at Manchester City. Now to Zaha, being booed and jeered by some of the Manchester United fans. He passes the ball forward, back to Oglou. On this left-hand side, back to Angelinho. A stocky figure. Back to Akta Koglu. Challenge from Varan, who's fallen him out of central defence, and he gets the ball, passes it in field, but reading it and stepping a long way forward with Sanchez. Oh, no, no, has it away towards our left. Just looking at that passage of play back. It was a run into Rashford, and Davison Sanchez has just read it and stepped in front of Rashford, but... I'd quite like to see Rashford come and meet that ball. Let's get an update in the Premier League at Kenoweth Road, Chris Coles. Lutonil Burnley won. He thought half-time would kill the frenetic nature of this game. Immediately quashed two good chances for Burnley in the opening minutes of the second half. Lukakuoliocho bursting through, shot well-safe by Thomas Kaminski. He was in action again to deny Josh Brownhill. Lutonil Burnley won. 1-1 here at Old Trafford. Arsenal still drawing 1-1 in longs. Amrabat tried a thread of ball through towards Hoiland. Blocks, and then cleared by Terera to Zaha up against Dallow. He's looking for the return ball. Angelina was caught late by Hannibal, and the referee is going to bring play back for that challenge, but he's not going to take any action, but it will be a free kick to Galatasaray. It's a classic late challenge from Hannibal on Angelina. Zaha again getting the better of Dallow. I was just saying a moment earlier that Zaha has been quiet, but when he has been needed, he's certainly got the better of Diogo Dallow, and they're starting to really feel that relationship between Angelina and Zaha. It's causing Manchester United a problem now. Vodaccha finds Sanchez. Ball is unable to be controlled by Tete, and it runs all the way through to Onana, all in yellow, away towards our left-hand side in front of the Stratford end. On a damp but very mild evening, light rain continuing to fall. Onana chips it away downfield. Hoiland tries to get his head on the end of that inside the centre-circle. Goes away from him. Zaha lifts it forward. Terera under pressure. Kymiros Kasemiro slides into the challenge again, looking for Rashford. That must be what? Three or four times, they've looked for that ball over the top. Hand the rest. Just Rashford and Bruno Fernandez playing on the shoulders of Galatasaray's back four, picking and choosing their target and playing off them. The rain heavy now. Ikadi picks it up. Cross comes in from Ahan, and turned behind for a corner kick. Let's see what Galatasaray can do from a set piece here. Five-living radio Manchester. No idea how Ikadi has got that amount of space coming from the central striker position for Galatasaray, dropping into the midfield, turning and feeding a runner and getting a corner as a result, but it's too easy for Manchester United. This is it, it's Verran. Just really obvious, go with him. So in the teaming rain, 1-1, Manchester United have got some defending to do. Galatasaray on that far side, the right corner kick, didn't beat the first man, that was disappointing. Headed away by Bruno Fernandez. Back with Tete goes, Galatasaray back in possession. Bueda right back, forward of the centre circle, low ball in from Angelina, a little flick by Terera didn't quite come off. It will reach Tete, right side of the penalty area, pulls it back now. Aktochok, glue with the first shot, that was blocked by Verran. Comes out towards Rashford, he gives it back towards Zaha. A little bit careless, Zaha now hoisted across, Tete waits for it to drop, brings it under control, right corner of the area onto his right foot, the Brazilian, looking for a shooting opportunity, blocked, hit first time by Ihan. And he's skied that from, I don't know, just under 30 yards out. It was a good old up and under, goal kick, 1-1. Yeah, really good passage of play from Galatasaray, sustaining the attack from the set piece. Zaha, Tete, again, Tete's been quiet as well, hasn't he? Just wonder about Manchester United, they started well, they were rewarded with a goal, yet since the Galatasaray equalised it, it's almost as if their confidence has taken a little bit of a dent. Because aside from the ball over the top on the counterattack, they're not creating anything, as here is Mason Mount, to Hannibal. Dallow going on ahead of him, but that's it, dives in, did he catch Dallow? The referee has a look at it and says no, and cleared away by Zaha. And the animated Galatasaray coach, Okanburek, with a wag of his index finger on his right foot in his suit, he also thought that it was a challenge made, fairly by Badaccia. He got a little bit lucky, Badaccia, because he's gone for the sliding tackle on Dallow, just watching a replay now, he's tried to dink it over the top of Badaccia, who's slid and committed himself, and it's deflected back off Dallow, and Dallow's ended up falling on the floor, hoping that the referee would have given a free kick, but not for me. They've only scored seven goals in their seven Premier League games, which is their fewest since the 0-708 campaign, the difference being in that season, they'd actually picked up 14 points, because they were hardly conceding many goals. But they've conceded again tonight, and they're struggling really to test Muslera. Out towards Rashford, coming in now with that left touch line. Rashford with pace, enters the penalty area, six yards up, now with a byline. He falls to Mason Mount, blocked by Hannibal, I think he got in the way of his own player's effort there by Mason Mount, and it goes out of play for a Manchester United throw. He did again, Manchester United to the byline, cut back from Rashford, and it was Davison Sánchez's leg that deflected the ball into the path of Mason Mount, and he knows it. Fernandez fires in a shot from the left corner of the area and hits the side netting. And it will be a goal kick, and there's a player down, and the Galatasaray penalty area, and the referee's just checking on him, so there might just be a stoppage in play. It's got to be Badakshi, hasn't it? No, it's not Badakshi. We'll see who it is in a moment. Our view has been, first of all, blocked by the referee, and now from Muslera. So it's Terera, who's down, the former Arsenal player. Four seasons at Arsenal, but he had the last two away with Lowens at Atlético Madrid and Fiorentina, so he actually only made 89 appearances with four goals during his time, but he joined Galatasaray in 2022, and he's getting some treatment, as were inside the last 30 seconds of normal time here, and Erick Tinhag is taking this opportunity to get some instructions across to Dalla. They've had chances Manchester United, that one from Mount earlier. I think that was the opening few minutes, it was Bruno Fernanda, so they have created Manchester United, but just lacked... ...rooflessness in front of goal. Southampton have got their first win in five at the weekend, leading at Stoke City in the championship. Stoke City, Nils Southampton-1 is a latest score, still playing in the first half. Terera is back on his feet, he jogs to the side of the pitch here. Three minutes have added on time, which we're now into here on BBC Radio 5 Live. Manchester United won Galatasaray won, the goal kick is headed away by Lindelof, for Manchester United, Hoiland, it runs off the top of his head, and Güey, the right back, only 23 years of age, they picked him up from Rang when he was released the right back two years ago. Bit of interest shown from Arsenal and Brighton. He's a promising player, Sasha Güey, headed from Zaha. Achtokoglu with the follow-up, lifts it goalwards, and he's lifted it behind in a goal kick as he was closed down, diving the feet by Onana. I think the referee's actually brought it back, because the deflection took the ball into Achtokoglu's path, off his hand. The referee's brought it back for a free kick to Manchester United. So one one it remains. That's Izzy Christensen, who's with us here tonight on this Tuesday evening in the Champions League, and keeping abreast of what's happening in the football league, tomorrow Newcastle against Paris Saint-Germain from Sevente, it's Rashford. Tries to get away from Güey. The referee is going to bring play back and give a free kick to Manchester United, again the Slovakian referee, trying to let the game flow. Thought Amravak was poised to take a quick free kick, but they are going to wait. So in stoppage time, six yards in from the left touch line, one one. Manchester United have an opportunity to toss this ball into the penalty area. It looks like Bruno Fernandez is going to whip this in. A minute before halftime, you've got to put it into the mix with real quality. Verrani's up from the back, Lindelof was also there. Casamiro's a natural threat, in it comes now, it was dropping. And Terera is skyed that up in the air, it drops outside the area. It's met by a right footed volley by Terera, who's lifted again quite high and it drops out of play for a throw over on that far side. In Manchester United's group, it's halftime in Denmark, Copenhagen-Nil, Bam Munich-Nil, PSV-Nil, Sevilla-Nil is a halftime scorer in Arsenal's group. Arsenal, remember, are still drawing one one away in line. So we'll get used from halftime from Alastair Bruce Ball. Fernandez with a cross from Manchester United, Sanchez there with a clearance. Ahan hooks it away for Galatasaray, back with Amravak though for Manchester United. Midway through the Galatasaray half, the whistles and the cheers and from the Galatasaray travelling support, Mason Mount's going to struggle to keep that ball in play on that far side. Buoy gets there first, his clearance though is only a partial one. And then the referee is saying he was fouled by Mason Mount and Mount actually walked into the referee as it'll be a free kick to the Turkish champions. No, it's just in... Tell you what, that's what Manchester United have missed, that endeavour and that hunger to win the ball back from Mason Mount. And that is something Mason Mount will always give you, is a high work rate and that is why he's in the team. Gareth Southgate is here, he's alongside Steve Holland. He was here at the weekend, was Gareth Southgate's number two. Mason Mount getting a run in the side now after injury. As the half-time whistle is sounded and it's Manchester United won Galatasaray won which is the half-time score. Poiland gave them the lead with a header after 17 minutes from Rashford's cross. But within six minutes, poor defending by Dallow and Wilfred Zahar had equalised, is he? Yeah, a good start from Manchester United but... He gave Galatasaray the option to get back into the game, poor defending by Dallow, like you said. And obviously, we're poised for a pretty exciting second half here. So half-time at Old Trafford in Group A, Manchester United won, Galatasaray won. Ian Dennis and Izzy Christensen watching events at Old Trafford there and there's been a bit of criticism for Anana on social media. Kit says, can we re-sign Dehaia yet? Izzy, is that fair? Is that the reason Manchester United are level going into the second half? I did look at the replay and I did wonder why Anana didn't come out for the ball. When a ball is bouncing like that inside your six-yard box towards the goal, it's a tough one but I think a goalkeeper needs to command the situation either by communication or by just coming and claiming the ball. And it's given Zahar the option to kind of body Dallow and keep the momentum of the ball bouncing further and further towards goal. And it's a lucky finish but Anana is actually caught in no-man's land and the bounce has just taken it over him into the back of the net. But I think it's six and two-threes between Dallow and Anana in that situation. Pat Nevin has also been watching the game with us. Pat, from Manchester United, we know from their performances in the Premier League that they've got one of the worst conversion records in the Premier League. They don't turn their chances into goals and there have been a few occasions in the first half where they've been guilty of exactly that. They have been maybe made some mountain a couple of times. He's got himself in the right positions, he's got it on target. Once his own player was in the way, it was a bit of a shame for him. But players will always tell you the same thing. You keep on getting into those positions and keep on putting it on target and eventually they'll start going in. It's just luck of the draw sometimes. I mean, you're talking about the Galatasaray goal there. You know, that's a deflection. You know, had that been caught clean, Anana probably saves it quite easily. But it was a mis-hit, it was a deflection, it goes over his head. And, you know, when it's not going for you, it's not going for you. But Manchester United have looked dangerous in quite a few occasions. They look the stronger team, the better team, but not by a huge amount. And you know, that is always there. There's enough danger in that offensive triumvirate. You know, the three that have got particularly 30, if he starts to get going. But Zaha, I thought he started really quietly, but he got the goal and suddenly he's looking lively again. And Akhadi hardly been involved. But you know, give him half a chance in your score. Well, Zaha very much enjoyed scoring that goal against Manchester United. His former side, of course, but it means that Manchester United are level at the break, despite having had just about the better of the first half. We'll be back there very shortly. It's also half-time in the game between Lons and Arsenal. And Alistair Bruce Bull, it's also level. Yeah, same scoreline, Lons won Arsenal one. It was going very nicely for Arsenal for the first 25 minutes or so, up against a highly motivated Lons team, playing in a supercharged atmosphere as well. But Arsenal soaked it up the early pressure in those opening 10 minutes, then stole themselves a goal. It was a Lons mistake. Adrian Thomason gave the ball away to Bakai Osaka, who played the perfect pass into Gabrielle Jézus, who took it on and finished brilliantly. They only held that lead for 10 minutes or so, though. And this time it was Arsenal giving the ball away. David Reyes' mistake and Wahi, the young centre forward, did really well to control the ball forward to him and just flick it across as he was off balance to Thomason, who made up for his earlier mistake by beautifully stroking the bouncing ball into the far corner of his net with the right foot. Then the real worry, Kelly, just after the half-hour mark, Bakai Osaka going down, struggling, went off the pitch under his own steam, replaced by Fabio Vieira. It may just be precautionary that. Obviously, big game against Manchester City coming on Sunday, but he has had a few niggles and knocks this season, so I know that will concern Arsenal fans. Late chance in the first half. There might say half chance as well, actually. Gabrielle Jézus looking at the far post, hit a half volley from about 15 yards out, couldn't keep it down, and he went flashing over the crossbar. So obviously the sack of injury is a concern, but at halftime it's level. Lost one Arsenal, won. Ali Fanoth, thank you very much. Tell us to Bruce Paul, keeping us across that game, but there's all sorts going on elsewhere in the Champions League this evening. John Bennett is across it, and is being treated by Jude Bellingham. I knew we'd be talking about Jude Bellingham again. Yeah, this is in Group C. Napoli won, Real Madrid 2 at halftime. What more can you say about Jude Bellingham? Eight goals in nine games now. This was special as well to make it 2-1. He picked it up just outside the centre-circle. He was driving at the penalty area, passed a couple of defenders, then side-footed into the net from just inside the box. Awful defending, but you have to credit Bellingham. And earlier he'd set up Vinicius Jr. for the equaliser after Leo Ostegard had headed Napoli into an early lead. Ostermen nearly made it 2-2, great save by Kepper, but it's Napoli won, Real Madrid 2. All the other three matches I'm watching are 0-0. In Group A Manchester United's Group, FC Copenhagen 0, Bayern Munich 0, Bayern struggling to create chances. In Group B Arsenal's Group, PSV Eindhoven 0, Sevilla 0, Sevilla yet to have a shot on target. And in Group D, this is actually a decent game. Inter, Niel, Ben Fika, Niel, Inter on top here. Denzel Dunn-Fries has missed one of the best chances for Inter. Thank you very much, John Bennett. Of course, those games taking place in the Champions League at the moment were eight o'clock kick-offs. 7.30 kick-off in the only Premier League match of the evening. It's between Luton and Burnley, about an hour gone, Chris Coles. Yes, 65 minutes gone, Kelly. Luton, Niel, Burnley won. Lyall Foster's first half stoppage time goal. Still the difference. Burnley looking more likely to extend that lead rather than Luton finding an equaliser. Boyd by that goal. Burnley looking good. The front three of Luca Colliozcio, Lyall Foster, Zechiam Duni. They look really threatening whenever they get into Luton's defensive third. Although Luton have just come really close via a Jacob Brown back post header. Remarkable goal line clearance from Josh Cullen, who threw himself onto his own goal line, somehow managed to head clear. Really good chance for Luton, who are still giving this a go and they still have plenty of time to get back into things with 25 minutes to play. Luton, Niel, Burnley won. Thank you very much, Chris. Let's head to Portman Road and the championship with Aaron Paul. Ipswich two-hold, Niel. Goals from Wes Burns and Conor Chaplin have given the home side a really solid foundation this evening. Hull have struggled with the quality Ipswich possess in the final third and they nearly grabbed a third. Marcus Harness in the D option to shoot. No, unselfish. He passed it forward to George Hust. He's shot two tame to find the back of their easy safe. Rocky will stop in the hole goal. Ipswich two-hold, Niel. Aaron, thank you very much. Elsewhere in the championship, Birmingham are two-nil up against Huddersfield. Goalers between Middlesbrough and Cardiff, Plymouth, Niel, Millwall, Niel. And in the eight o'clock kickoff, Stoke are trailing Southampton by a goal to Niel and West Brom are one-nil up against Sheffield-Weddenstay. In league one, it's Blackpool Niel, Derby Niel, Bolton won, Stevenage won, Bressel Rovers two, Portvale Niel, Burton Niel, Wigan won, Cambridge Niel, Barnsley two, Carlisle Niel, Peterborough Niel, Charlton won, Exeter won, Cheltham Niel, Fleetwood won, late Norriant won, Lincoln Niel, Northampton two, Reading Niel, Oxford won, Shrewsbury Niel, and Portsmouth Niel, Wickham won. In league two, Cruella, Coralxandra one-nil up against Jillingham, Doncaster leading Crawley by a goal to Niel, Grimsby one-nil up against Barrow, Harrogate trailing one-nil at home to Wimbledon, Mansfield Niel, Wrexham Niel, Morecom Niel, Accrington Niel, Newport one, Colchester one, Knox County three, Swindon one, Stockport two, Forest Green Rovers Niel, Sutton United Niel, Salford Niel, Tranmayer one, Bradford Niel, and Walsall Niel, MK Don's Niel. That's us up to date then in the EFL and across the Champions League. We'll be back for second half commentary from Old Trafford very shortly, with the rest of the day's sports news headlines as well, after the BBC News with Juliana Cassidy. Listen on BBC Sounds. This is BBC Radio 5 Live. The referee's body, the PGMOL, has released full audio from the VAR Hub when Liverpool had a gold diss allowed incorrectly. In their loss at Spurs at the weekend, the audio shows the chaos in the VAR room when they realised they got it wrong. The Home Secretary, Swelle Braverman, has used her speech at the Conservative Party Conference to say politicians have been too squeamish when it comes to tackling migration. She drew cheers from the hall in Manchester for announcing the government would soon start closing asylum hotels. Meanwhile, Rishi Sunak has denied that the conference has been overshadowed by the uncertainty surrounding the HS2 rail project. This morning he insisted he wouldn't be rushed into a decision, and a factory worker who put plastic bags, rubber gloves, and ringpools into food destined for Nando's and the Ivy restaurant chain has been jailed. Gary Jones knowingly and maliciously contaminated the products while working at a Worcestershire food manufacturer. Hey, babes. Hello, hello, hello. We shall massage here with an extra special invitation for you. Start your engines. Every Thursday we're having a party round yours. This is the best club I have ever been to. You guys should come sometime. Get ready for the time of your life. For the BBC, it's not too hard. With Joel Damit, Alexandra Burke and more. I love this. This is so cumbersome. Let's party. It might be so much fun. RuPaul's Drag Race UK. It's game on. Watch on BBC iPlayer. This is Five Live Sports with Kelly Cakes. On Five Live. Listen on BBC Sounds. We will be back to Old Trafford very shortly, but as Juliana just mentioned, the audio of discussions between the match officials around Luis Diaz's disallowed goal against Tottenham has been released by the governing body for referees, the PGMOL. Liverpool asked the Premier League for the audio after the controversy in the first half of their 2-1 defeat on Saturday. Just in case you've missed hearing this, this is what happened. Check complete. It's fine. Perfect. Yeah. Off. Thank you. Good process. The on-field decision was offside. Are you happy with this? Yeah. Are you happy with this? Offside. Goal. Yeah. That's not what he does. What? On-field decision was offside. Are you happy with this? Yeah, it's fine. Yeah, it's onside. The image we gave you is onside. Left back. He's played. He's gone offside. Yeah. Now. Delay, delay, delay. On Lee's saying to delay. On Lee's saying to delay. Pardon? On Lee's calling in to say delay the game. To complete the decision is offside. Cut the listen. I don't know. I don't know. On Lee's saying to delay. On Lee's saying to delay. On Lee? Yeah. Delayed the game. To delay the game. Stopped the game. Yeah, they've restarted the game. Yeah, they've restarted. Yeah. Can't do anything. No. I can't do anything. I can't do anything. The voices you heard there of the video assistant referee, his assistant, the assistant video referee, also the replay operator, who was the person saying that the on-field decision was offside as well. We also heard the noise, the voice rather, of Oli Kohut, who was the PGMOL hub ops. So those two people knocked qualified referees in that instance, but did spot the error. PGMOL says it was a result of a lapse of concentration and loss of focus. Scotland Play Island in a crunch rugby World Cup pool B match on Saturday in the latest Rugby Union Daily podcast correspondent Chris Jones, BBC Scotland journalist Tom English and BBC Wales commentator Gareth Rhys Owen discussed the size of the task facing the Scots. From here on in, especially considering you, Tom, it's just knock-out rugby. And here we go. Yeah, it is, yeah. It's as the Scottish players are saying after the Romania game, do or die, their World Cup final and variations on that theme. So it's, yeah, it's serious. It's serious. We were in the camp this morning and it was Finn Russell and it was Ali Price. And yeah, you could tell slightly different tone about the whole thing. I put it to you that if this was a straight shootout, win or bust, do or die, then Scotland is still the underdogs, not least because of their record against Ireland, which is horrible. But when you add the extra layer, the fact they need to win most probably by more than eight points, does that turn it from mission improbable to nearer mission impossible? Well, it's certainly mission improbable. That's for sure. You know, you look at the record, as you say, they've lost eight in a row against Ireland, 202 points to 88 over those eight games, 24 Irish tries to eight Scotland tries, average score of 25-11 in Ireland's favour. So, you know, it's tricky. Is it impossible? Well, a lot of people would say it's the closest thing you're going to get to impossible because the role that Ireland are on, 16 in a row, as we all know, Scotland haven't beaten Ireland by the margin that they require since 2001 in a competitive game. So... That's a while. Yeah, it's... But then again, you look at it, I mean, it's only New Zealand over the last three years have beaten Ireland by eight points, the margin that Scotland need. Only one team in close to three years have done this. So, it's massive task, massive, massive task for Scotland. But, you know, they have a puncturous chance. They need to take their chances. And you can download the full podcast right now at BBC Sounds. And there will be live commentary of that match between Scotland and Ireland on Radio 5 on Saturday evening. We'll be heading back to Old Trafford, very shortly where the second half is about to get underway between Manchester United and Galatasaray. And in fact, the players lining up ahead of kickoff for the second half, Manchester United set to make a change with news of that, your commentary team at Old Trafford. Is he Christensen? Any in Dennis? Yes, thank you, Kelly. Christian Erickson has replaced Hannibal at the start of the second half. Galatasaray yet to make any changes. There's the referee's whistle. And we're back underway. Talking of changes, as I'm just going to go a little bit off-piece, there's going to be a change to one of our five-live sport regulars. So, not only is she a producer, she's been a presenter and a reporter, but Juliet Farrington, it's the last time that we are sadly working with her tonight. She moves off to Passages New, much loved, deeply respected. I don't know, I speak from everybody. From not just the football team, but for five-live sport, to say Jules, you will be missed. Anyway, we're back underway here at Old Trafford. 1-1 in this Champions League game with O'Nanaharangol, Dallow, Varan, Lindolf and Amrabat is the defence. Fernandez, Casamiro and Mount with Erickson, Hoyland and Rashford. As Erickson plays the ball forward to Amrabat. Amrabat with the cross and cleared away by Caladasaray's side that has Musslera in goal, Bué, Badaccia, Sanchez and Angelinho, Ihan, Terera, Zaha, Tete, Actacoglu and Icardi. So, all in white, they're defending the strep for then, they're playing from left to right against the Manchester United side in their red shirts and black shorts from right to left and Rashford. On this near side, holds off Bué and now to Amrabat. He did well, Amrabat with the cross, headed away by Ihan and now at Erickson as Manchester United try and find a way to take them back in front, but it's with Zaha who will run forward. And Zaha, with all his experience, holds on to the ball. Is he Christmas? Yeah, does well, Zaha, just breaking out. Again, kind of a sloppy start for Manchester United. You can really see the thinking from Erickson Hague about bringing Erickson on to instill some control in the central area. Manchester United were starting to lose a grip of the game in the second half in central areas. He also brings a threat from set pieces, which have also been taught tonight by Manchester United's Thunders. Bradford City have equalised at Frenton Park, Tremia 1, Bradford 1, Cambridge 0, Bonsley 3, Portsmouth, the leaders of League One are level. As Ihan wins the ball here for Galatasaray, back to Hague with a shot that was blocked by Varan, creating a bit of a threat. Plymouth 0, Millwall 1 is the latest scorer in the championship. Going to be an interesting second half, this one won a piece. I'll tell you what, Galatasaray should have just scored then. Hague took Olu with the shot. He had Tete on the outside. They've just got into Manchester United's box far too easily. Bué, to Tete. Davison Sanchez formally have taught them. And now with Badak Chop in the centre-circle. That was a poor ball. He's forced Angelinho extremely wide on that far side. The left-back did well to retrieve that situation, but ultimately Manchester United now have won the ball back, and Casamiro hits it early, and Rashford again was making that run. But this time he's made the run from the left-hand side. A diagonal run to the edge of the D and he's outstretched left-boot. He couldn't bring the ball down, and it's into the arms of Mishler. It's a straight pass, diagonal run. Sometimes the other way round. Diagonal run, straight pass. Manchester United just picking up where they left off in the first half, looking to go long early. Catch Galatasaray off guard, getting the likes of Rashford and Hoiland in behind. Zaha, early ball, at Olu with the turn, and he looked for the return ball for Zaha. Zaha's run was being tracked by Dala, and he's put the ball out of play for Rey, a throw on that far side. Galatasaray have started his second half in a threatening manner. They really have one-one. We'll go to Luton Town, Chris Colts. Burnley are 12 minutes away from their first Premier League win of the season, still leading Luton 1-0, but they are hanging on. Luton swam on over the Burnley goal. Colton Morris at the centre of everything. He's just headed wide. Luton come forward again with Tahit Chong. It's out for a throw. Luton-nil, Burnley 1. First win of the season, and it would be a huge boost for Burnley. They think five of their opening seven games were against teams that finished in the top eight last season. So the fixture list certainly wasn't kind to Vincent Kompany's team, so to get a win against Luton, that should have been Luton's first home game of the season, but Kenal the Throne wasn't ready. That's why it's being rescheduled for tonight. For Burnley, that would give them a real lift, and we'll be there on Saturday at Turf, more Burnley against Chelsea, one of four commentaries on another busy weekend of live sport on BBC Radio 5 Live. We're also live on BBC Sounds tonight, as well as Radio Manchester. Newport 2, Colchester 1 is the latest scorer in League 2, and more can lead Ackrington by a goal to nil. Three minutes into the second half. It's hoisted high by Varan. Good challenge by Buébis, that aerial duel with Rashford. Now up towards Hoiland, lays it off well to Ericsson. Ericsson spreads the ball out wide. Fernandez on that right-hand side, running forward, edge of the area, shapes the shoot, always on the rise off his left boot, and it's off target, and it's a goal kick, and it remains 1-1. Again, it's Hoiland pinning the centre-backs. Looking for runners off him, it's Ericsson that runs off him, plays the ball out to Bruno Fernandez. Bruno Fernandez is cut inside, and he's got the overlapping run from Diego Dallo, which I think he should have played. Let's get an update from Lance Arsenal, Alistair Bruce-Ball. Five minutes gone in the second half. Arsenal nearly getting themselves back in front. Gabrielle Jézus won the ball high up the field. Fedeleandro Trossard on the left, cut onto his right foot. His shot was saved by Samba, and then the rebound from the save hit Kevin Danso, and very nearly ended up in his own net. Samba scrambled another save in there. Lance won Arsenal 1. Arsenal on Matchday 3, travel to Spain, now play Sevilla in the beautiful city of Sevilla, and Sevilla have just taken the lead in the Netherlands. PSB Eindhoven nil, Sevilla 1. So as it stands, both of those sides, Sevilla and Arsenal, would have four points in Group B. Manchester United would still have some work to do if they were to be held here by Galatasaray, elsewhere in League One, Charlton 2, Exeter 1, Northampton 2, Reading 1, and you're up to date with the goals as they go in on BBC Radio 5 Live. 5 Live final score is available on the red button and also on the BBC Sport website, but Galatasaray, all in white, playing from left to right. Look, a very confident side in this second half, is he, Christensen? Yeah, they've picked up where they finished the first half really. Stein to combine, Tete's getting into the game. Tete to Bouet, starting to show a little bit more ambition as well, and Bouet, with a back heel, is going to win a corner off the shins of Amrabat on this right-hand side, so a corner kick to Galatasaray. That's probably the first time we've seen Tete and Bouet combining, a little bit like Angelino and Zaha on the other side, and that run from Bouet received an applause from his team-mates who are warming up on the side, the Galatasaray substitutes. The fists being thrust into the air by the Galatasaray supporters, decked in Claret and Amber, out swinging corner. The card is headed, it gets a touch to it, it goes away from goal, collected on the far side, this is Zaha trying to dance his way in, goes to ground another challenge with Dallo, wagging a finger by the referee from Slovakia, and then Dallo looking to try and get Ericsson, who plays it first time. First touch, Rashford round the back, Flats stays down, Rashford got support for Nandes, squares the ball, and it's squandered. You're thinking, does he square it, does he go for goal? And in the end, that hesitation, by the time he's squared it, Bouet is back and turns it behind for a corner kick, and what a chance that wasn't taken by Manchester United. You want to know something? I can't figure out whether the recovery run from Bouet was exceptional, or it was just a poor, poor decision for Marcus Rashford. But either way, this counterattack, it comes from Ericsson, the ball around the corner to the run of Rashford over, beyond Angelina. Rashford, the only reason I can think he hasn't shot is because the angle is a little bit tight, but nonetheless, that ball needs to hit the back of the net. Corner taken, and then it calls to mount, and he hits it right foot in effort. That's tipped over by Mouslera. It was a comfortable save. Mouslera watched it all the way. It was dropping, but he's still required his right hand to come around and turn it behind for a corner kick. Manchester United won, Galatasaray won, nine minutes into the second half. Corner kick that Nandes waits to take on that far side, the right. The white shirts are back at plenty inside their own penalty area. Right footed, outswinger, Casamiro's up, Amrabat lays it off. The referee gets in the way. It's going to be an uncontested drop ball. He puts his hands in the way as the referee can't do that. It's an innocent mistake. And he's going to give an uncontested drop ball to Manchester United. Goal at Portman Road, Aaron Paul. Ipswich 3, Hallnill, door terse on the left-hand side of the box. Fizzed the ball across the face of Gollick. It took a deflection, excuse me, Velta Marcus, Harness, and who, well, he tapped in from four yards out. Ipswich 3, Hallnill. Did that late pressure for Luton pay off? There's been a goal, Chris Coles. It has paid off Luton's relentless pressure, has got a reward, 1-1, Elijah Adabayo back from goal. Goodness gracious, what a goal for Burnley. They're back in front. That is a world-class strike from Jakob Brun Larson, right into the top corner, just moments after Adabayo had equalised for Luton. Five minutes to play. It's Luton 1, Burnley 2. So, dramatic stuff in that Premier League game, and in Naples in the Champions League, Napoli 2, Real Madrid 2 is at a latest score, and Curtis Davis has been sent off for Cheltenham. So, Cheltenham, who still yet to score, they're training at home to Fleetwood. So, that would be 11 games without a goal this season in Ligue 1 for the Liga Cheltenham, now down to 10 men. Bolton 2, Stevenage 2 is the latest score, also in that division. And in Manchester United's group, I said that Copenhagen were a tough side on home soil. They're now leading Bayern Munich by a goal to nil. Copenhagen 1, Bayern 0. Manchester United, they have to win this game. They're going to be playing catch-up otherwise in Group A. Fernandez, early ball in from the right-hand side, look towards Mount, picked up by Miss Lara. 10 minutes into the second half, is he? 1-1, you can feel the frustration. I'll tell you what, a lot has just happened in this last 60 seconds. The referee's just got in the way again to Christian Erikson's frustration. Manchester United are on the attack. And moments before that, I was watching on the far side, Bruno Fernandez and Diogo Dallo having a feisty exchange, and that's from all the way over here. God knows what it was like for the fans on the opposite side. Increasing frustration, Manchester United. Well, here is Hoylan, leaves it to Rashford. Rashford with the back heel. Hoylan works it out towards the right. Fernandez back towards Rashford, pops up on the right-hand side. This time he goes for goal, fires it in. Sometimes Marcus Rashford has been guilty of actually going for goal rather than looking for Hoylan in recent weeks, and on the time that he did look towards Bruno Fernandez rather than going for goal, again, it's that decision-making you were talking about. It's exactly that, Denner, but I'll tell you what else it is. It's the decision-making on the type of cross Marcus Rashford delivers, because on that occasion he tries to fire it across goal, a bit similar to what he did for the assist in the first half, but the dink to the back post if he got his head up, Christian Eriksson was free at the back post unmarked. This isn't Christian, some of this here on BBC Radio 5 Live. Terair is down, there's a stoppage in play. Blackpool, Nill, Derby, two is the latest score in League One, and at Brunton Park also in League One. Peter Brunnenyton have just taken the lead. I think the frustration is being added to because of Terair, they probably think it's a bit of gamesmanship, so there's a stoppage in play here, but he is feeling his groin on his right side. Let's go find out how Arsenal are doing in France. Alistair Bruce Ball. Just over 12 minutes played in the second half, still longs one Arsenal one. It's become quite an even game at the start of this second half, but Arsenal closest to getting back in front in the early stages after the break. Trossard's shot saved, and then very nearly went in for an own goal off Danso. Longs attacking as I speak, but it's longs one Arsenal one. We're on air until 10.30 tonight, then of course it's Colin Murray on BBC Radio 5 Live. Any reaction that we're unable to bring you before half-ten will be on the 5 Live Football Daily Podcast. Remember, there's a rugby union daily podcast every day for the Rugby Union World Cup. Tomorrow night, Newcastle Paris, San Germain and the Champions League. The Cricket World Cup starts on Thursday, ball by ball commentary in England against New Zealand on Sports Extra from 9.30. We'll have France, Italy and the Rugby Union World Cup on Friday, and then on Saturday it's a mixture of football and live rugby union from 3 o'clock. And then in fact with the boxing, I think 5 Live Sports on air for about 12 hours on Saturday. But we're back underway, and we're 12 minutes into the second half, and the atmosphere has been ramped up inside Old Trafford. The Manchester United fans now are trying to play their part here. Because remember, Copenhagen are leading, the draw is going to leave Manchester United struggling in the early stages of Group A. And for only the third time in the Champions League campaign, they will be witnessing their opening two matches, Casamiro to Mount Highland. Highland stares himself, brilliant finish by Highland. In front of the stripper then, but the flag is up, and the celebrations are cut short, offside. Highland with a check, the first touch, shook it away from Bouet, raffled the ball into the back of the net, left footed. But the celebrations quickly cut short, and it's still 1-1. VAR will naturally have a check, but it looks like they're already looking to take the free kick for Galatasaray. He's pointing at himself, Highland. Was it me that was offside? We're just watching the replay. He's offside. Yes, he is. It's tight, but he is offside. But I'll tell you what, the finish, the footwork inside the box, was exquisite, and I know it's offside, it's Dysalao, but that'll give him confidence. He's been exceptional tonight, Rasmus Highland. There'll be more to come from him, I'm sure. So that goal, Dysalao. There's been a smoke bomb or something been set off in the jumping Galatasaray supporters away towards our right. You can clearly smell the sulphur, you can see it drifting in the lights here at Old Trafford. And Manchester United supporters are trying to do their bit as well. So it's a cracking atmosphere here at Old Trafford. For this 25th appearance in the group stages of the Champions League, Manchester United, Ericsson to Amrabat. There's going to be a double change being made. That was a foul on Amrabat by Bué, and he is shown a yellow card. He's the second Galatasaray player to be shown yellow by the Slovakian referee. But a double change, and we're going to see Sergio Alvera, Portuguese international. We're also going to see Baras Yilmaz, who's going to be coming on, who's a striker. So this is where the changes are made. So Terreira is one of the players coming off. And then the other one is going to be Tete. So Alvera will just replace Terreira in the midfield. He joined last season from Porto, won a first title in his first season. And then the other one is going to be Baras Yilmaz, who's a forward to replace Tete. Let's get an update from Ken Othroud and the Premier League. Chris Cole. Luton won Burnley too, but we are into seven minutes of added on time. Burnley doing their best to keep the ball in the Luton half, as J. Rodriguez strikes goalwards and only just wide. Luton need to get this forward, trailing Burnley by two goals to one. Manchester United were attacking on the right-hand side, cleared by Galatasaray, played back in by Ericsson. And the header from the Rashford, who was jumping down with the header, saved by Michelera. That's exactly what Ericsson brings, this first-time ball into the area. Marcus Rashford does really well to attack it in front of Buoy, but he doesn't quite generate enough power. So, Galatasaray with Ocan Burakus made a couple of changes. We've been playing now for nearly an hour here on BBC Radio 5 Live. Rashford to Ericsson, ball inside, Casamiro lets it come across his body, runs away from his man, passes the ball out towards Bruno Fernandez. Back to Casamiro, slightly behind him, still gets the shot away, right-footed. Blocked by the Galatasaray defence, picked up by Zaha. Can they break on the counter-attack? Here is Yilmaz, pressed a touch, it passed Amrabat. Amrabat, so much energy. He ran more than any other player in the world, over 50 miles in Qatar. He won't beat him for energy. Manchester United are attacking, nice turn, Mount with a shot, left footed, pulls it wide, but again, much better from Manchester United. They're really starting to pick each other out in the box now. You can feel the response from the fans. It's absolutely electric here in Old Trafford. Manchester United are really feeding off that, they're finding their groove and it's just that cutting edge now. The final product, the composure on the finish, and it was then Mason Mount finding his space inside the box. The turn, the left foot finish, he drags it just wide. Much better for Manchester United. The crowd are feeding off the positive play from Manchester United. A little bit predictable in the first half. All of a sudden, now they... You can sense that goal threat from the home team. Radio 5 live, BBC sounds. Also live on Radio Manchester. Bué clears it long for Galatasaray. 61 minutes played. Give you all the latest scores when we can. Blackpool have got a goal back at home to Derby in League One. Carlisle, Nill, Peterborough won, gave you that one. Bolton, three, Stevenage, two. Grimsby, two, Barrow, Nill. Interleading Benfica in San Siro by a goal to Nill. Last year's runners-up. And that's it, we're up today. There's going to be more changes down below for Galatasaray. Bué clears on the half-follie, only as far as Ericsson plays it back. He's over the head of Rashford and out of play, it goes for a throw. But there is still a lot of time, just under half an hour. Yeah, still plenty of time for both sides. We've seen what Galatasaray can do after going a goal behind. They respond well. Game is very much in the balance. Better chances of late, though, from Manchester United. Chris Mertens is going to be coming on. And we're also going to see Vector Nelson, who's a defender. So interesting to see whether they bring on the extra defender and go with three at the back. As the ball is headed away by Sanchez, the former Tottenham man climbed high and headed away. Back to Oulu with the clearance, only as far as that mount. A little flick there by Fernandez up his heel. Takes it away from Angelinho. The rain pouring down once again here at Old Trafford, as Manchester United in their red shirts and black shorts. Play from right to left, one-one, five-live. Casamiro looking for the return ball. It might sit up nicely to Fernandez. Hits it first time right footed, but it was straight, it was later. And that's what you get with Bruno Fernandez playing off the right-hand side. You can just see here now, Galatasaray just taking the sting out of Manchester United. Bruno Fernandez is getting increasingly frustrated, but it was again that man, Baracar, who's just made that defensive clearance from the dink over from Casamiro. Galatasaray just using all the gamesmanship right now. Yeah, they are. And the referee's just said to him, if you want to go off the field, you can do so. But the players now know that you're off the field then for a minimum of 30 seconds. Otherwise, get to your feet, and Badacir does exactly that. Gets to his feet, still that double change waits to be made by Okan Burak. 63 minutes play, it's still one-one. Arsenal are still drawing away at Longs, one-one in Group B, where Sevilla lead by Agole Taneel. In this group, Manchester United's group, Copenhagen, are still leading by Amunic by Agole Taneel. Charlton 3, Exeter 1 is the latest scorer in League One. And Cheltenham's for-launch start to the season continues, down to 10 men, and they're still yet to score, and they've conceded again to Fleetwood. Cheltenham-Nil, Fleetwood 2 at the bottom of League One. Five-live with Casamiro, guided header down by Fernandez, to Mason Mount, neatly played by Manchester United. Ericsson midway through his own half, opens it up, Amrabat lets it to run over his head, and Bué with the interception. Did he keep the ball in play? The assistant referee said he did, but Amrabat, by that point, had run back and tarnished it up back towards O'Nanna. His clearance is met by the... Head there of Oliveira in the midfield, with his beard and his ponytail, the Portuguese international Bust experience, but he's given them all away. Sanchez dived in, and Hoylund's away, but that's your trust to get back at Hoylund. Hoylund's away! And Hoylund scores! Clinical finish with Hoylund! And the mistake is punished. Oliveira, very, very costly. And there was only one outcome, and it's Hoylund in the double, as Manchester United are back in front, 2-1. Oliveira came on for Galatasaray to firm things up in the midfield, and he's just completely let one loose. Rasmus Hoylund has sniffed it out, and he's had half the pitch nearly to run. The pace to burn off the defender, and then the dink over the goal key. How many times do we see the finish go in a cross goal? And it doesn't have that lift on it, but that lift on it from Hoylund is absolutely wonderful, because that is what takes it into the back of the net. A fantastic goal for Manchester United's best player tonight so far this evening. He almost scored a goal like that at the weekend, but Tyrek Mitchell was actually able to get back and make the goal line clearance for Crystal Palace. But Badukcere was unable to keep pace with Hoylund. Sanchez had committed himself, but it all came from a mistake from Oliveira. Rashford, incidentally, has gone off. So, Garnaccio has come on to replace Marcus Rashford. We're still yet to see the change being made by Galatasaray, but Manchester United lead by two goals to one, and at the time being, they've changed the mind of bringing on the Danish defender, Nelson, but they may be bringing on Dries Mertens. There hasn't been a restart, because Musslera was injured in the process. But the celebrations here inside Old Trafford, because Hoylund, who's never scored a hat-trick in club football, is now on one for Manchester United. Give him time, and the young Dane will be very, very popular, and he'll score goals. He's got an IPA goal, it's clear to see. You can see there, you can see the level of a strike in those moments. When you've come 1v1 with the goalkeeper, you've got an angle. You're not going straight at the goal, you've got an angle. He had an angle onto the left-hand side. His only option, in my opinion, was to bink it, and that's exactly what he did. Like I said, he's been exceptional this evening. Bayern Munich, incidentally, in Manchester United's group-in-group, they have equalised in Denmark. Kofen Hagen won, Bayern won, Middlesbrough lead Cardiff City by two goals to nil. Michael Karak, for the Manchester United player, of course. His side will be unbeaten in five, as Mason Mount hits an early ball straight through to Musslera, who's able to shake off that knock. So United lead 2-1. Bayern have levelled its 1-1, Sevilla leading in Holland. What about Arsenal in France? Alistair Brucemore. 22 minutes to play, it remains longs-won Arsenal, won a chance for eager team in the last few minutes. First for longs-salis Abdul, Sam Edg, shooting into the side netting, and then Tomiasso at the other end for Arsenal. Thought he scored his first goal for the club. Erdogan's corner, brilliant volley from Tomiasso. Well saved, 1-1. Galatasaray should be levelled. Cross played in by Yilmaz on the right. Oh, Nanna should gather this in, but he's dived at it, and all he's done is pushed it to Zaha. Zaha's team up, Aksirk O'Glu, and he's hit it right, put it in wide, and he knows he should have hit the target. Oh, dear, oh, dear, Anana, what on earth are you doing? Like you say, Anana, the ball in from Yilmaz, flashed across that corridor of the six-yard box. The set... The finish is just wide. I'll tell you what, that is close. But Anana, what on earth is he doing? Perring that into the path. I think he's tried to catch it. He's tried to catch it, and he's not connected with the ball, and they are lucky Manchester United. Very, very lucky. Meanwhile, the combination play between Fernandez. Mount now on the right-hand side, Mount's cross, Gannaccio slips, but he still gets there. Edge of the area runs forward inside to Fernandez. Fernandez with a chip towards Hoiland. Cleared away by Badaccio for Galatasaray. Manchester United, much better second half. Greater fluency. Yeah, much more fluency. Still picking up with the principles of the first half. They're flicking it round the corner first time, looking for the space in behind, but they've got to be so, so careful right now, Manchester United. Full time in the Premier League. Chris Coles at Kenilmaz Road. Burnley have their first Premier League win of the season, secured quite brilliantly by Jaco Brun Larson's fine strike from range. Five minutes from time, just moments after Elijah Adderbeau had equalised for Luton. Big win for Vincent Coen and Burnley. Two-one winners at Luton. Galatasaray are level at 2-2 for the second time tonight. They have come from behind, and it is at the foot loop. With the ball, finished it very, very well. Yilmaz has caused problems down the right, his cross, and it was finished very, very well. The flares are being set off in the Galatasaray. End away towards the right-hand side. They've packed Pets Manchester United back again. 2-2. How naive can you be? There was alarm bells ringing moments earlier, and it's that man, Yilmaz, who's just come off the bench and destroyed. And we're back down this left-hand side from Manchester United. And it's just the cross across, and the run from Akta Colu, and the first touch, and the finish across, and Arno into the far-bottom corner. Manchester United, when are they going to learn to control the game and see it out? Took it very, very well on the run, right footed. And Galatasaray, you think, after Hoiland's first goal in the first half, they were back level within six minutes. They were back level within four after Hoiland's second goal in this contest. 2-2. Goal in longs. Alistair Bruce-Ball. Arsenal now find themselves behind Tomayasu, very nearly giving them the lead. Two minutes later, a fabulous finish from Elie Wahid, a young centre forward for Longs, crossing from the right-medic first time. And David Ray didn't stand a chance, Longs to Arsenal, one. Excellent result. This would be for Galatasaray. You can hear for yourselves what the Galatasaray travelling support make of it. Just a sign of sight of limbs with arms, scarves, hats, jumpers, everything being swirled around the heads in that end towards the right-hand side. They never did make that change, did they? Oh, no, Dries Mertens did come on in the end. So Mertens is on the Belgian international. I don't think they actually brought on Victor Nelson, though, the defender, as the ball is played forward, interception by Bouet. I think chances of nicking this one do Galatasaray. Bouet now with the cross and the queuing up for it. And in the end, the header from Iqadi just looked up and was saved easily by Onana. Yeah, every single chance in the last five, ten minutes for Galatasaray has come from this right-hand side. Down Manchester United's left, Amrabat just getting caught out of shape in the midfielder. What's concerned about that at the start of the game? Galatasaray have really honed in on that in this second half. So remember, Copenhagen won by and won. Manchester United drawing 2-2 here, Arsenal behind. Sevilla still leading PSV. Charlton 4-X at a one is the latest score in League One, in League Two, Tramir Robes are back in front at home to Bradford City by two goals to one. Crew lead Jillingham by two goals to nil. We have about 18 minutes remaining of normal time here at Old Trafford, Turkish Voices you can hear. And it was Zaha, the player who went off for Dries Mertens, so the former Crystal Palace man who got the first goal, the first equaliser for Galatasaray, 2-2. Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandez have actually just swapped roles. So Bruno Fernandez has come into the centre of midfield and Mason Mount's out on the right and he's actually just won a free kick after a foot race with Angelino. Really good opportunity for Man United. It is, it's a free kick, it's right-hand side. Just a little bit further on than the level of the penalty area. Fernandez to take it, fires it in, headed out, comes to Garnaccio, controls the ball, then looks to go on the outside, left foot, he will work it in low. And they were looking there for Oil and it was a devilish ball in, but it was some good defending and in the end it was Ikari who was back there of all people with the vital challenge. Yeah, it was a brilliant ball across from Garnaccio, off the second phase of the wide free kick, over on the far right-hand side. Garnaccio has received the ball, chopped onto his left and he's fist the ball right across the six-yard line. So Ericsson to take the corner kick in front of the tunnel area at the Stretford end, here at Old Trafford. He waits, left armour loft, right foot in, deep towards the far post, headed back goalwards and it's dropping from Casamiro's header onto the roof of the net. Maslera had it covered, that'll be a goal kick. Quarter of an hour remains, is he? Yes, much better delivery from Christian Ericsson. The first half, Bruno Fernandez was taking the corners and they weren't really beating the first man, although they were playing short and not ended up with an end product, but that ball in from Ericsson, fizzes it right across to the back to Casamiro and what I would say there is Casamiro, he's gone for goal, but can you head it back into the mix? Paul played down the line, on that far side the left, actor Hulu will win a... No, he won't win a corner, it'll be a goal kick. Incidentally, when Maslera was taking his time, the Slovakian referee, Ivan Krasliak was telling him to... No time wasting, hurry it up, as O'Nanna now waits to take the goal kick, Blackpool won, Derby three, Bristol rovers three, Port Bale 0, a two-lady scores in League One. O'Nanna gets it back. Oh, what a dreadful mistake by O'Nanna, he's presented the ball to Merton's penalty! Oh, my word! O'Nanna gave Casamiro no chance, it was a desperate lunge by Casamiro, that was dreadful from O'Nanna and Gallatassarite, and then to make matters worse, Casamiro is shown a second yellow card, because he was booked in the first half, Manchester United are down to ten men. A catalogue of errors, and Manchester United at 2-2, that was a shocking, shocking bit of play by O'Nanna. Oh, my word. What can I say about this? Playing out from the back, yeah, great, wonderful. But O'Nanna just does not see Merton's, who is in front of Casamiro, he passes the ball straight to him, and Merton's first touch takes him into the box, and he's been so clever, because he knows Casamiro has to slide, and he's just used the challenge, ridden the challenge, and just gone down and got a penalty. It looks like Icardi over the ball against O'Nanna, whose confidence must be right at the bottom right now. I bet they don't try the tap penalty, that they tried a few weeks ago, Gallatassarite, that caused Icardi to have an embarrassing miss. But now, Gallatassarite, with 13 minutes remaining, Mauer Icardi, who's had such a prolific start to the season, a chance maybe for O'Nanna to redeem himself after his error led to the penalty from Casamiro's challenge. Gallatassarite, who have never won in England, in the Champions League, with a chance to take the lead for the first time in this contest here at Old Trafford. Icardi runs up now, and he's missed it! He's missed it again! Icardi right footed, drags it wide to the left-hand post. He missed the tap penalty just a few weeks ago. He couldn't hit this first time out from 12 yards out, and it remains at 2-2. Wow! Tram! You know what? O'Nanna guesses the right way, and I actually think, if the ball is on target, I think he saves that. I don't want to say redemption, I think that's too kind. He's gone the right way, and I think he saves that if it's on target, but he's dragged it wide, poor penalty. Well, he had that embarrassing miss against Istanbul's bird. It was Atta Ulu, who just laid it off to the unrushing Icardi. He rolled it wide from 10 yards then. He couldn't hit the target from 12 yards on this occasion. And Manchester United, what a let-off! 2-2, they're still down to 10 men. They are down to 10 men, they've lost one of their better players on the evening, Casamiro, two yellow cards, but look at O'Nanna now on the goal kick, going long. No risks. Well, what a dramatic night here at the end of Champions League. Manchester United can certainly count themselves fortunate. 2-2, but the ball is pub long. Atta Ulu goes after it. Darlo, they will get there first. It will be a throw to Manchester United. And it means that Casamiro will miss the matchday three game against Copenhagen. Here is Mason Mount, trying to take it on himself. Sanchez clears the ball away. Ericsson to Garnaccio. Garnaccio stumbling, still going Garnaccio. Wrigling clear, what a challenge that came in. That was Bodeccio. How many times has he been on the end for Galatasaray, just throwing himself at it? Because Garnaccio, an amazing run, looked like he was going to get a goal for United. Yeah, you can see that, but Duccio is celebrating that like a goal. He's been an absolute wall tonight. It is an excellent play from Garnaccio, coming in from the left. Should have scored. 2-2, Fernandez rolls the corner short, backs it to Fernandez, fires it in, and Iqari hooks it out behind for another corner. I'll tell you, I've just seen that replay. Garnaccio did everything he could. I was being a bit harsh, and he should have scored. The block was impeccable. Karlal had gone an injury time equaliser at home to Peterborough, one one at Brunton Park, that's in League One. Corner kick to Manchester United, here in the Champions League Live on 5-Live, Brunner Fernandez hits it in towards the near post, Iqari's header out. It's Garnaccio, who's forced to turn, and the pressure passes the ball back towards Onana. There'll be a few anxious moments here with Iqari just in front of him, but he clears it long out towards Garnaccio. Nice control on this near side, the left. 5-Live, BBC sounds, radio Manchester, with just over 10 minutes remaining. 2-2, Amrabat hits it forward, commanding header away by Davison Sanchez, and it reaches Iqari. Iqari's in here for Galatasaray, and he scoops it, goal was, and he finds the back of it out this time. He redeems himself after missing the earlier penalty, and Galatasaray for the first time in this Champions League game, lead on the night at Old Trafford, as they threaten their first win in England, Manchester United 2, Galatasaray 3. This is just incredible. I cannot believe what we are seeing. I think it's Amrabat that's keeping him onside, but he is left completely unmarked. Manchester United centre-backs for Ran and Lindelof, sorry, have no idea where Iqari is. He's behind them, I think it's Amrabat that's keeping him onside. And the ball's just gone back over the top, and the finish. I tell you what, you said about redemption, Dano. Yeah, it's Amrabat that doesn't get up, he's way onside. The ball's gone back, and he's dinked it over in honour. Well, I think that's the first time I've seen people chanting in the directors' box here at Old Trafford, but they're celebrating away towards our left. There were journalists of Galatasaray jumping up as well, away towards our right, and there are wild scenes in the Galatasaray away end. Because they've never won in England, drawn 3, lost 7, draws at Liverpool, Leeds United and Manchester United. The defeat here would actually equal a club record of three successive defeats in Europe for Manchester United, who now are going to be playing serious catch-up in this Champions League group if they're not careful. A successive defeat, trailing 3-2 to the Turkish champions who are maintaining their excellent start to the season. They've only had one defeat in their last 25 games in all competitions. Now we're going to see Nelson coming on, and Dumballe is going to be coming on as well. He's on loan from Tottenham, so a double change. And we're also going to be seeing Anthony, who's going to be coming on for Manchester United. He's missed the last five matches after that leave of absence. So Anthony as a substitute is going to be coming on for Manchester United because time is running out here at Old Trafford. You can only hear Turkish voices, five live, BBC sounds, Radio Manchester, nine minutes remain. Manchester United. And now we've got some more work here. This is Bué coming forward, Bué taking it on. Bué almost with a fourth. He didn't right-footed over the crossbar, came off the legs of Dallow who made the challenge. Corner kick to Galatasaray. They just seem to have two or three more players on the pitch right now. Galatasaray is Bué, the fullback. He was just charging through the middle of Manchester United like they are not there. And he's gone for the finish. He could have actually squared it, but he's gone for the finish. And it was Dallow that just got a nick on it, it's taken over the bar, over an honour, but I tell you what, Manchester United, where is the leadership in this team right now? Bayern Munich have come from behind in Denmark, Copenhagen won, Bayern Munich two. Change is being made, Angelinho is coming off. And Don Belé has come on to replace the former Manchester City man. So... The French international coming on. And then I think the other player who's going to be going off is Kahn, Ihan. And that is why Victor Nelson comes on. So they'll probably go three at the back for Victor Nelson, the Danish defender to come on. That's the change he's being made by Galatasaray. Oliveira with the corner kick right-hand side. It's an out swinger, it's headed back goalwards and it drops wide. And it goes out for a goal kick. But Manchester United two, Galatasaray three. After twice, Manchester United had taken the lead. And it's going to be Mason Mount who's coming off for Anthony to come on. Full-time at Portman Road, Aaron Paul. Ipswich three, Hal Nill, goals from Burns, Chaplin and Harnes, and Ipswich Town, top of the championship tonight. Ipswich three, Hal Nill. I'll give you all the results in a few moments' time. PSV have equalised in Eindhoven. PSV, Eindhoven won, Sevilla won. That's in Arsenal's group. Remember Arsenal are still behind to Lons by two goals to one in Group B. But here, Galatasaray against the ten men of Manchester United. Lead by three goals to two. They haven't won away in 17 matches in the group stages. Since 10 years ago, when they beat Schalke, 3-2 in the last 16. Since then, they've lost 14, they've drawn three. As Hoylund wants Galatasaray to take the free kick quickly. And Galatasaray will do so with Sanchez who's given the hurry up from the referee. What a dramatic second half, is he? I can't quite catch my breath at what's going on in the pitch. Just been enthralling the ball turning over the transitions. Galatasaray just hungry. It was a lovely finish, a scoop finish from Mikardi. 11 goals now he's scored in 13 games this season. They're all about his quality from his time in Italy. Twice he was top scorer in Serie A. As Galatasaray now, the ball chip forward, curled round the corner by Oliveira to Bouet inside. Yilmaz lets it run. The lay-off back towards Oliveira has a go. Dig a goal from 25 yards out, right forward in, always on the rise. Goal kick, Galatasaray there with four minutes remaining, 3-2. It's not rocket science what Galatasaray have done in this game. What they've done is they've targeted Amrabat at left back from Manchester United. Not his familiar position, but in this second half in particular, the amount of times that they have got down this left-hand side, far too easily, and that is where the goals have come from. The results from the championship, Birmingham City first win in six. Beating Huddersfield town by four goals to one. Back it goes to Onana, clears it away first time. It's which top of the table, one point clear of Leicester after a 3-0 win over Hull City, whose eight-match unbeaten run comes to an end. Middlesbrough's mini-revival continues unbeaten in five. Beating Cardiff, 2-0 at the riverside. Plymouth-0, Millwall two. And two latey scores in the championship. Stokes City-0, Southampton one, and West Bromwich Albion leads Sheffield Wednesday by a goal to 0. The results in League One, Blackpool one, Derby three. They're still playing at Bolton, Bolton leading, Steveage 3-2. Still playing Bristol Rovers, three-poor, Vale-0. Burton two, Wigan one as a result. Cambridge-Nill Barnes before also a result. Carl Lyle scrambled the late equaliser to draw one-one with Peterborough. Charlton four, Exeter one, Cheltenham-Nill, Fleetwood two. Still Cheltenham cannot score. Late Norrie at one, Lincoln-Nill is the latest. Northampton beat Reading 3-1, Oxford three, Shrewsbury-Nill, Portsmouth two, Wigan one. The leaders are still unbeaten. I'll give you the latest scores in League Two, as D'Ambele picks the ball up for Galatasaray. After we've heard what Arsenal are doing with Alistair Bruce-Bourgh. Well, they're trying to find an equaliser away to Long's here. 88th minute of the game, Long's leading Arsenal by two goals to 1-20. Striker Wahee getting them in front with a beautiful first time hit into the far corner. Lots of possession for Arsenal since then. Michel Arteta has run the changes, yet really though to create a clear cut chance to get themselves back in it. Long's to Arsenal one. Manchester United are still behind here to Galatasaray, all in white defending the strep for Dan, but with against the 10 man after Kassimiro sending off. They're seeing a lot more of the ball. They're going to make a substitution. Marcial's going to be coming on. It means, as promised, I can give you the full-time results in League Two. Crew Two, Jillingham Nill. Doncaster beat Crawley by two goals to Nill. Grimsby Two, Barrow One. Harrogate Town Nill, Wimbledon One. Mansfield Nill, Wrexham Nill is how it finished at Field Mill. So Mansfield Town are still unbeaten. Morkham One, Akrington One. Newport County beat Colchester United by two goals to one. Swindon Town's unbeaten run and coming to an end against the League Leaders. Nott's County who won 3-1 at Meadow Lane. Stockport Two, Forrest Green Nill. Sutton Nill, Salford Two. Sutton still haven't won since the opening day. Tramir beat Bradford City 2-1 and it finished Walsall Nill. MK Don's Nill. Amrabat is the player who comes off. Marcial comes on and Eric Tenhag has three minutes plus stoppage time. Is he to try and salvage something from this game here at Old Trafford? Yeah, and Amrabat's just come off, trying to kind of identify the signal that Tenhag's just given the two centre-backs. I'll figure out and let you know how many United are going to look, but what we do know is that I need to get a goal. They've just got a free kick on the edge of the box. Could help. That was a foul. Sergio Oliveira against his fellow Portuguese international. And so Manchester United now, right of centre. Just under 25 yards out from goal. Down to ten men, inside the last 60 seconds of normal time, here in the rain at Old Trafford. Trelling by three goals for two. Bruno Fernandez. Izzy Wehr says, where is the leadership? They need the captain now to step up here with this free kick. But there is a wall of what? Six from White shirts for Galatasaray. Well... Five in the wall indeed, but they're going to have two red shirts on the end of it. I don't mind being proven wrong, but it ain't an angle for a right foot. I'll tell you that, Dono. So... It is. Bruno Fernandez with a free kick into the wall, it goes. And we're into seven minutes of added-on time. Seven minutes, a minimum of seven minutes now here. On five, live. From the throw, Manchester United. Fernandez. Back it goes. Ball works in. Ericsson's touch, broken up by Galatasaray. Achtung Uluk clears it away, downfield. Varan will see it back towards Onana. And then if he had brittle confidence before tonight, Onana after his display tonight, that certainly won't have improved a great deal as the ball is played forward by Varan. Out towards that side, towards Anthony. Dispossessed and loses the ball on that far side. Galatasaray. Ball played now by Mertens to Yilmaz. He's made a difference since coming on, Yilmaz. Bué always a threat on this right-hand side, coming forward. Now looks towards Akali. What an effort that was. Hit it on the half-volley. It was a sweet strike too, right footed just wide. They almost had a fourth. Yeah, it was Bué again running down this right-hand side. Ghanacho not tracking him. We did, but he didn't keep up with him. And it was just the run from Mikardi. And the half-volley, connected with it really well. He's quite unlucky, but far too easy again from Manchester United. I know they're down to ten. You can see why Bué's attracted the interest of Brighton Arsenal, can't you? I was just thinking the exact thing. Then I've been really impressed. He's grown into the game, especially this second half. I don't know if that's because he's played in front of us. But I've been really impressed with him. Just beaten in the air on that occasion by Lindelof. But the substitute, the Victor Nelson, the Danish defender, came across to put the ball out of play for a throw. So on this near side, Lindelof not quite level with the penalty air on the left. He takes it, Marchelle with a little touch. Ericsson was under pressure from Dries Mertens, and it goes, he was a hurried ball forward as a result of that. Now to play it goes for a throw to Galatasaray. You want to know something? I don't think Manchester United help each other at all. I think the basics throw in small passes, sets. From what I've seen tonight and what I've seen this season, they just don't help each other out. They put bounces on throw-ins so that when you control in the ball, you're a little bit unorthodox. And I've seen a few of them tonight, and I just think, like, I'll show you back to basics. Gotta do the simple things well. Well, he said in his programme notes, Eric Ten Haag, with no attempt to hide behind the excuses, not being good enough. And certainly the mistakes that they've made tonight have proven costly. As Onanna hits the ball long, Bué could climb again from the right back in the aerial duel. Not beat them this occasion by Lindelof, and now they try to release Hielmars. His head bobbing, beaten to the ball, though, by Ericsson. They were appealing for a free kick. We're into the third minute of the seven to be added on. The 10-minute Manchester United hit long by Ericsson. Bué there and will clear it away for Galatasaray. Marciel against Indombele. Ericsson beaten by the bounce of the ball, gets a right foot onto it, a little bit scrappy there in the midfield. On the half folly, Ericsson turn, lifts it downfield. Bué there, will get there before Garnaccio. And behind it goes... No, it doesn't go out of play on this occasion, kept him played by Lindelof. Remember, Arsenal are still behind despite taking the lead. Lowns two, Arsenal won. As Onanna goes long downfield. Nelson with a header away. Only as far as his fellow Dane, Ericsson hits it early. Garnaccio, 30 yards out from goal. Lindelof. Lindelof's bemoaning the lack of options. Looking for that creativity, Manchester United. Poor ball. Getting bogged down now with a weighted pressure, it would seem, for Bruno Fernandez. Manchester United, they just can't break free of the shackles here, as their concerning start to the season continues. Verran not helped by, of course, the fact that they're down to 10 men. As Sanchez, climbs over the top of Hoiland with a header. An extra good loop on that far side now, has it, and Dumballet rolls away from Bruno Fernandez and runs forward. 2-1. It is, and Dumballet, a little bit of a stumble. And then the ball was a loose one from Mertens. Now to Bruno Fernandez, to Garnaccio. But it's three against five. Garnaccio on the left-hand side. Three minutes about it on time remain, on five-live. Here is Hoiland. Hoiland with a back heel, gives them all away. It goes straight through to the goalkeeper, Mouslera. That's probably the only foot that Hoiland's put wrong tonight. Is that back heel? He thinks that he can back heel it back into the path of Garnaccio. He had the idea of a 1-2 in his head, but Garnaccio didn't. But I'll tell you what, in the midst of this Manchester United performance, if they do find a equaliser, Hoiland has been absolutely fantastic. It's going to be a famous win for Galatasaray. The Turkish champions, Ericsson, slides it forward. Marciel enters the penalty area. Marciel! What a save by Mouslera! Flags up on the far side. Mouslera punches the air with delight, because Marciel's made the run inside left channel of the penalty area. He's opened it up onto his right foot, it's curling, and it's clawed away by the right arm of Mouslera. Hoiland must have been the one in the offside position. Yeah, it must have been Hoiland on the second phase, but it's the first time we've actually seen Mentioned Marciel since he came on. Yeah, it's Marciel who's the one who's offside, just off. But the ball from Ericsson through, Marciel cutting in. He's actually deflected, and you think it's going right into that far corner. It's a good save. Manchester United will be pointless at the bottom of Group A. They will be four points behind Galatasaray. They will be six points behind Bayamunik, who come here on the final group game. The pressure on Ericsson on the hard side then to try and get something from it. Those back-to-back games against Copenhagen are going to have to try and kickstart the Flagging Champions League campaign for only the third time in Manchester United's history in this competition. Will they be winless after two games? 11-12 campaign and 98-99. Here, of course, that they won it. But with time desperately running out, we enter the last 60 seconds of injury time. Oh, Nanner has come up from the back. Manchester United down to 10 men, trailed by three goals to two. Ericsson waits to take the free kick. That 10 yards in from the left touch line. Right-footed on the diagonal, aimed towards Ohnana, over the head of the goalkeeper. Headed in, headed away by Sanchez. Hasn't really been beaten much in the air tonight, the former Tottenham man. And all of a sudden, Ohnana is out of his goal. And Galatasaray play the ball forward. Atta Erglu, held up by Fernandez as Ohnana retreated. Early ball forward. The ball from Fernandez finds Dallow, unmarked right-hand side. 15 seconds remain. Dallow right corner of the area, tries to get away from his man. There it was again, Badaksha. How many times has he been there right-place, right-time for Galatasaray tonight? And it will be a free kick to Galatasaray, and that might well be up. And the camera lenses are trained on Ericsson Hark. Yeah, it's bad actually. It's been absolutely exceptional this evening. I'll tell you what, though, that tackle from Bruno Fernandez. Sorry, over to you, Deno. There is the final whistle. Manchester United's miserable start continues, and their mistakes have proved so costly, as Galatasaray earned a famous win in Old Trafford. The first time in 11 attempts that they've won on English soil. No wonder their supporters celebrate wildly. Manchester United feeding the game with 10 men, two. Galatasaray, three. Is he? Well, the scene's in front of us right now. The Galatasaray bench and all of their staff that must work at the club. There's hundreds of them over in Turkey, but you can see their fans as well, what it means to them. I mean, to come here, Manchester United are like a wounded animal at the moment. And my word, they have taken advantage. Yes, they were gifted a chance back into the game by Anana from that era. But Manchester United, again, were talking about a performance which had elements of quality, but not enough control. And at 1-0, when they went 1-0 up with Thruhojland, you just start to wonder at what stage are we going to start seeing a Manchester United team control the game after taking the lead and taking advantage of that, pushing for a second goal. Reaction to come, but it's finished here at Old Trafford. Manchester United, two. Galatasaray, three. Kelly. Ian Dennis, Izzy Christensen, Old Trafford, four.
